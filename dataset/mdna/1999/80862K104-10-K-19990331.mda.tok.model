item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a global biopharmaceutical company that acquires  develops and commercializes specialist oriented proprietary drugs for treating chronic and life threatening diseases  such as hepatitis b  hepatitis c  cancer  immune system disorders and cystic fibrosis 
currently  the company has two drugs in clinical development  zadaxin for hepatitis b  hepatitis c  cancer and immune system disorders  and cpx for cystic fibrosis 
the company also has other drug candidates in preclinical development 
to date  the company s principal focus has been the development and commercialization of zadaxin and the development of cpx 
from commencement of operations through december   the company incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
the company expects its sales  gross margin and operating expenses to increase over the next several years as it expands its sales  research and development  clinical testing and marketing capabilities 
the company s ability to achieve profitable operations is primarily dependent on obtaining additional financing to support its operations and long term product development and commercialization programs  increasing zadaxin sales in approved markets  securing regulatory approvals for zadaxin in additional countries and successfully launching zadaxin  if approved  in such countries 
in addition  other factors may also impact the company s ability to achieve a profitable level of operations such as spending associated with successful development of cpx  acquiring rights to additional drugs  and entering into and extending agreements for product development and commercialization  where appropriate 
the company s operating results may fluctuate from period to period as a result of  among other things  market acceptance of zadaxin  the timing and costs associated with preclinical and clinical development of the company s products  the regulatory approval process  and the acquisition of additional product rights 
setbacks in the launch  sale or distribution of zadaxin  preclinical and clinical development of the company s products  particularly cpx  the regulatory approval process or relationships with collaborative partners  and any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  among other developments  have in the past had  and could in the future have  an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
results of operations product sales were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales in were largely fourth quarter sales into the people s republic of china to establish importation duty rates and internal distribution patterns 
in  sales were relatively flat through the quarters as the four geographic regions of the people s republic of china  northern  central  southern and guangzhou area  were established 
in  both unit and us dollar sales grew at an average of quarter to quarter as the awareness and use of zadaxin expanded 
currently  the company has received approval to market zadaxin in argentina  cambodia  italy  kuwait  mexico  myanmar  the people s republic of china  pakistan  peru  the philippines  singapore  venezuela  and vietnam 
the people s republic of china  like japan and certain other asian markets  uses a tiered method to import and distribute products 
the distributors make the sales in the country  but the product is imported for them by licensed importers 
in  the company sold to one principal importer agent who then resold to four distributors inside the people s republic of china 
reflecting the expansion and stability of the company s sales to the people s republic of china in  the company began working extensively with a second importing agent in addition to the agent used in this enabled the expansion of sales to the four distributors 
for the year ended december   four distributors in china accounted for of the company s product sales 
in addition  the company has filed for approval to market zadaxin in additional countries and anticipates additional filings in other countries 
the company expects product sales to increase in its existing approved markets in and beyond  upon the commencement of the commercial launch of zadaxin in additional markets once regulatory approvals are secured 
the level of such product sales increase is dependent upon increased zadaxin market penetration in the company s existing approved markets  additional zadaxin marketing approvals and the successful launch of zadaxin in new markets 
although the company remains optimistic regarding the prospects of zadaxin  there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant levels of product sales or that the company will receive additional zadaxin market approvals 
cost of product sales was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase is attributable to increased product sales 
the company expects cost of product sales to vary from quarter to quarter  depending upon the level of product sales  the absorption of fixed product related costs  and any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product 
research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the increase in research and development expenses as compared to was due to increased clinical trial expenses 
additional pilot clinical studies to expand the use of zadaxin in overseas markets were started in clinical trial expenses in also increased due to clinical trial expenses in japan  and additional clinical trial expenses for the clinical development of cpx 
the initiation and continuation of these programs by the company had and will continue to have a significant effect on the company s research and development expenses in the future and will require the company to seek additional capital resources in the immediate future 
for the year ended december   the decrease in research and development expenses as compared to was primarily attributable to decreases in regulatory expenses and in costs associated with decreased zadaxin clinical trials  essentially due to the completion of the company s zadaxin phase hepatitis b in taiwan during the first half of  offset by increased preclinical development expenses associated with cpx 
in general  the company expects product research and development expenses to increase over the next several years and to vary quarter to quarter as the company pursues its strategy of initiating additional clinical trials and testing  entering into one or more corporate partnering arrangements  acquiring product rights  and expanding regulatory activities 
marketing expenses were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in over reflected the increases in activities related to expanding distribution and marketing efforts around the world in addition to increased professional services related to the sales increase 
the slight reduction in expenses in compared to was largely related to the preparatory marketing expenses in  which were beneficial throughout the company expects marketing expenses to increase significantly in the next several quarters and years as it anticipates expanding its commercialization and marketing efforts and pursuing other strategic relationships 
general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to increased general office expenses associated with increased rent and office relocation expenses  investment banking fees and fees for professional services  primarily legal and accounting fees  associated with the company s adoption of a shareholder rights plan and proposed public offering 
in the near term  the company expects general and administrative expenses to vary quarter to quarter as the company augments its general and administrative activities and resources to support increased expenditures on clinical trials and testing  and regulatory  pre commercialization and marketing activities 
on july   the company loaned to thomas e 
moore  its former chairman ceo   in exchange for a promise to repay the loan on demand and the pledge of  shares of sciclone common stock owned by mr 
moore as collateral for such loan 
during it was determined that the value of the collateral underlying the loan made to mr 
moore was more than temporarily impaired and that a writedown of the book value of the note would be required 
upon further investigation relative to the collectibility of the demand note  it was determined that the entire million  plus accumulated interest of approximately  was in substantial doubt 
as a result of this determination the company elected to write off the entire remaining book value in a non cash charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of and cancel the  shares held as collateral 
under a new agreement  mr 
moore received credit against his total indebtedness of approximately million 
this credit is calculated as the value of mr 
moore s  shares of sciclone common stock cancelled by the company based on the greater of two stock prices 
the first stock price is calculated as the average day closing stock price at closing of this agreement 
the second stock price is calculated as the average day closing stock price at september  after calculating and applying the appropriate credit  the balance of the remaining debt  if any  will be paid in five installments according to a schedule beginning on october  at  and increasing by a factor of each six month anniversary thereafter with final payment due no later than october  in the event that the higher day average stock price exceeds the amount of the indebtedness such excess will be remitted to mr 
moore in cash or stock  at the company s sole discretion 
if in stock  the number of shares will not exceed  shares 
see note shareholder s equity of notes to consolidated financials 
a non cash charge to earnings was recorded in april for  representing a deemed dividend associated with the issuance of the series c preferred stock 
net interest and investment income was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to and in as compared to resulted from lower average invested cash balances 
liquidity and capital resources in april  the company received approximately  before deducting expenses from the sale of  shares of series c preferred stock in a private placement 
as of december   all but  shares of series c preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
in january   of the remaining  shares of series c preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock and  of such remaining shares of series c preferred stock were redeemed at a conversion price of approximately per common share 
as a result  there are no outstanding shares of series c preferred stock 
in march  the company also received approximately  from one of its executive officers as a partial payment of an outstanding loan 
see note notes receivable from officers 
in november the company settled a note with a former executive officer by accepting payment of approximately  in cash and offsetting approximately  in retained salary and housing allowance accruals against the debt 
at december    and  the company had   and  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid short term and long term investments 
net cash used by the company in operating activities amounted to   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was less than the net loss primarily due to increases in clinical trial expense accruals primarily for japan  inventory decreases  a deemed dividend in connection with the issuance of the company s series c preferred stock and impairment of a note receivable from a former officer 
these amounts were partially offset by increases in prepaid expense primarily for product marketing rights acquired for the us and europe 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was greater than the company s net loss for such period primarily due to increases in accounts receivable associated with sales from the company s launch of zadaxin in its approved markets and increases in payments to third parties for goods and services and to employees for compensation and benefits 
these amounts were partially offset by non cash charges associated with depreciation and amortization  decreases in prepayments of certain future expenses  and increases in amounts owed to third parties for clinical trials 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  is less than the company s net loss for such period primarily due to non cash charges associated with depreciation of furniture and equipment and amortization of deferred compensation in addition to increases in amounts owed to third parties for goods and services 
these amounts were partially offset by cash used for inventory purchases  increases in and prepayments of certain future period expenses and payments of amounts owed to third parties related to clinical trial expenses and compensation and benefits 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to the net sale of  in marketable securities offset by the purchase of approximately  in equipment and furniture 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to the net sale of  in marketable securities offset by the purchase of approximately  in equipment and furniture 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to the net sale of  in marketable securities offset by the purchase of approximately  in equipment and furniture 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of  in proceeds  approximately  of which related to the company s sale and issuance of  shares of series c preferred stock  approximately  of which related to the issuance of common stock and approximately  of which related to the payment on notes receivable from former and current officers 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of  related to company s repurchase of its common stock under the company s approved stock repurchase plan and the amounts loaned to mr 
moore referred to above of  offset by  in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock by the exercise of outstanding warrants and from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  related to  in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option plan offset by approximately  related to company s repurchase of its common stock 
the report of the independent auditors on the company s financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph indicating that the company s historical operating losses and lack of sufficient significant revenues from product sales raises substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
without additional financing  significant reduction in operation expenses or sales growth beyond management s expectations  or a combination thereof  management believes its existing capital resources and interest on funds available are adequate to maintain its current and planned operations only through june to support such operations beyond june  the company will need to raise additional financing in the near term 
the company is pursuing additional financings including a private placement of common stock and common stock warrants  use of its equity line see note to consolidated financial statements  bank debt financing and corporate partnering to develop zadaxin in the us and europe 
the company plans to conclude one or more of such additional financings over the next two to six months  although no assurance can be given that such financing will occur in the time frame expected by the company  on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
the company s capital requirements may change depending upon numerous factors  including the level of zadaxin product sales  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative partners and the status of competitive products 
impact of the year as is true for most companies  the year computer issue could create a risk for the company 
if systems do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the risk for the company exists in the following areas systems used by the company to run its business and systems used by the company s vendors 
the company is currently evaluating its exposure in both of these areas 
the company has reviewed its current systems and has been evaluating whether it is appropriate to replace or upgrade systems that are known to be year non compliant 
for those areas which have been identified as year non compliant  the cost to upgrade or replace is not expected to be material to the company s operating results 
the company is in the process of contacting its critical vendors to determine that the vendors operations and the products and services they provide are year compliant 
to varying degrees  the company is dependent upon a large number of third parties that provide information  goods and services to the company 
these include financial institutions  suppliers  vendors  research partners and governmental entities 
if significant numbers of these third parties experience failures in their computer systems or equipment due to year non compliance  it could affect the company s ability to process transactions  manufacture products or engage in similar normal business activities 
while some of these risks are outside the control of the company  the company has instituted programs  including internal records review and use of external questionnaires to identify key third parties  assess their level of year compliance  update contracts and address any non compliance issues 
the total costs related to year compliance cannot be known precisely at this time but it is not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors dependence on zadaxin r and cpx 
the company s principal drug development efforts are currently focused primarily on zadaxin and cpx 
clinical trials of zadaxin sponsored by the company and or other parties are currently in progress or planned and favorable results from such trials will be necessary to gain regulatory approval in major pharmaceutical markets 
sales of zadaxin commenced in while zadaxin has been approved for commercial sale in countries  no assurance can be given that zadaxin approvals will be obtained in additional countries or for the treatment of additional indications  such as cancer  in a timely fashion or at all 
the company s launch of zadaxin in the people s republic of china  the philippines and singapore was the first commercial introduction of zadaxin by the company  and no assurance can be given that continued commercialization of zadaxin will prove successful 
the company has not yet launched zadaxin in argentina  cambodia  italy  kuwait  mexico  myanmar  pakistan  peru or vietnam and no assurance can be given that future launches of zadaxin will prove successful in these countries or in any additional countries 
future sales of zadaxin will depend on market acceptance and successful distribution 
in particular  although the people s republic of china has the highest hepatitis b prevalence in the world  the low average income and poorly developed distribution infrastructure present ongoing challenges to successful commercialization of zadaxin in that market 
because the company currently relies on zadaxin as its sole source of revenue  the failure to demonstrate the drug s efficacy in future clinical trials  obtain additional marketing approvals or commercialize the drug successfully would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may experience delays and encounter difficulties in clinical trials of cpx  its drug in phase clinical development for treatment of cystic fibrosis cf 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any clinical trial will provide statistically significant evidence of the efficacy of cpx in treating cf 
a failure to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of cpx in a cf clinical trial  obtain regulatory approval of cpx for cf or successfully commercialize cpx could have a material adverse effect on the company 
no history of significant revenues  continuing operating losses 
the company has only recently generated revenues from the commercialization of its lead product  zadaxin  and there is substantial uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of any future revenues and whether such future revenues will be material 
the company cannot predict when or if marketing approvals for cpx will be obtained or additional marketing approvals for zadaxin will be obtained 
even if such approvals are obtained  there can be no assurance that zadaxin and cpx will be commercialized successfully 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since its inception and has a substantial accumulated deficit 
if sales increase over the next several years  the company expects its operating expenses also to increase over the next several years as it expands its development  clinical testing and marketing capabilities 
the company s ability to achieve a profitable level of operations is dependent in large part on obtaining additional financing to support its operations and its long term product development and commercialization efforts  successful expansion of the market for zadaxin in asia  latin america and the middle east  obtaining additional regulatory approvals for zadaxin and or future products  entering into a corporate partnering arrangement for development in the us and europe of a combination therapy for hepatitis c including zadaxin plus interferon  entering into other agreements for product development and commercialization  where appropriate  and continuing to expand from development into successful marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve a profitable level of operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional financing 
since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily through sales of equity securities 
however  the company will need to obtain substantial additional financing before june to support its operations and its long term product development and commercialization programs 
without additional financing  management believes its existing capital resources and interest on funds available are adequate to maintain its current and planned operations only through june the company is exploring corporate partnering  a private placement of equity securities  the sale of equity securities under its equity line and other opportunities  including debt instruments  to increase its capital resources 
however  the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level of zadaxin product sales  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation of preclinical and clinical development expenses and opportunities  the timing and cost of regulatory approvals  patent costs  competing technological and market developments  the nature of existing and future collaborative relationships  the ability to use the equity line and the company s ability to establish development  sales  manufacturing and marketing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or a timely basis  if at all 
other than the equity line the company has no commitments or arrangements for additional funding and may not be able to obtain needed financing 
draws under the equity line are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including registration of the investor s resale of the shares  a minimum trading price per share  volume limitations  limitations on the number of shares that can be issued without shareholder approval and limitations on the number of shares of the company s common stock the investor may hold at any point in time 
unless the company and the investor agree otherwise  the facility is not available when the company s stock is trading at less than per share  which price has been decreased to pursuant to an oral agreement between the parties 
the unavailability or timing of financing could prevent or delay the company s long term product development and commercialization programs and would require the company to curtail or cease operations 
compliance with nasdaq listing requirements disclosure relating to low priced stock 
the company s common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market the national market 
however  in order to continue to be included in the national market  a company must meet certain maintenance criteria 
the maintenance criteria require a minimum bid price of per share   in net tangible assets total assets less total liabilities and goodwill and  market value of the public float excluding shares held directly or indirectly by any officer or director of the company and by any person holding beneficially more than of the company s outstanding shares 
as of march  the closing bid price of the company s common stock was and as of december  the company had net tangible assets of  failure to meet these maintenance criteria may result in the delisting of the company s common stock from the national market 
trading  if any  in the company s common stock would thereafter be conducted in the non nasdaq over the counter market 
if the company s common stock were delisted from trading on nasdaq  an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotation as to the market value of  the company s common stock  which could severely limit the market liquidity of the common stock and limit the ability of the company s stockholders to sell the common stock in the secondary market 
dependence on third parties 
the company s strategy contemplates that it will enter into various collaborative arrangements with other entities 
to date  the company has acquired rights to zadaxin  cpx and certain other drugs but is only actively pursuing clinical development of zadaxin and cpx 
failure to license or otherwise acquire rights to additional drugs would result in a shortage of products for development 
in addition  the company has licensed exclusive rights to develop and market zadaxin in japan to schering plough kk schering plough kk has a substantial commitment to alpha interferon  which is an approved therapy for hepatitis b and hepatitis c in japan 
there can be no assurance that the relationship will prove successful or that the company will be able to negotiate additional arrangements in the future  including a corporate partnering arrangement for development in the us and europe of a combination therapy for hepatitis c including zadaxin plus interferon 
the amount and timing of resources that collaborators devote to their activities with the company will not be within the control of the company and may be affected by financial difficulties or other factors affecting these third parties 
there can be no assurance that such parties will perform their obligations as expected 
moreover  the company s ability to obtain regulatory approval in one country may be delayed or adversely affected by the timing of regulatory activities and approvals in one or more other countries  particularly if the company does not participate in the regulatory approval process in such other countries 
foreign sales and operations 
the company s financial condition in the near term will be highly dependent on zadaxin sales in foreign jurisdictions  where sales and operations are subject to inherent risks  including difficulties and delays in obtaining pricing approvals and reimbursement  difficulties and delays in obtaining product health registration and importation permits  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political instability  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  currency fluctuations and potential adverse tax consequences 
certain foreign countries regulate pricing of pharmaceuticals and such regulation may result in prices significantly below those that would prevail in a free market 
the majority of the company s current sales are to customers in the people s republic of china 
patents and proprietary rights 
the us and most european composition of matter patents for thymosin alpha have expired 
the company will in the future have only limited composition of matter patents for thymosin alpha and this could adversely affect the company s proprietary rights 
however  the company owns or has exclusive licenses for use and or process patents or patent applications in the us  europe  japan and other jurisdictions for thymosin alpha  and for cpx in the us and will seek to protect such products from competition through such patent protection and through other means 
the company s success is significantly dependent on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products and technologies and to preserve its trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
no assurance can be given that the company s pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or that any patents will provide competitive advantages or will not be invalidated or circumvented by its competitors 
moreover  no assurance can be given that patents are not issued to  or patent applications have not been filed by  other companies which would have an adverse effect on the company s ability to use  manufacture or market its products or maintain its competitive position with respect to its products 
numerous patents and patent applications relating to thymosin alpha are held under exclusive license and the breach by the company of the terms of such license could result in the loss of the company s rights to such patents and patent applications 
other companies obtaining patents claiming products or processes useful to the company may bring infringement actions against the company and such litigation is typically costly and time consuming 
as a result  the company may be required to obtain licenses from others or not be able to use  manufacture or market its products 
such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the patent positions of biotechnology firms generally are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy has emerged regarding the validity and scope of claims in biotechnology patents  and courts have issued varying interpretations in the recent past  and legal standards concerning validity  scope and interpretations of claims in biotechnology patents may continue to evolve 
even issued patents may later be modified or revoked by the us patent and trademark office  the european patent office or the courts in proceedings instituted by third parties 
moreover  the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a patent with similar claims in another country and claim interpretation and infringement laws vary among countries  so the extent of any patent protection is uncertain and may vary in different countries 
pharmaceuticals are not patentable in certain countries in sciclone s zadaxin territory  or have only recently become patentable  and enforcement of intellectual property rights in many countries in such territory has been limited or non existent 
future enforcement of patents and proprietary rights in many countries in sciclone s zadaxin territory can be expected to be problematic or unpredictable 
there can be no assurance that any patents issued or licensed to the company will provide it with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by others 
no assurance can be given that holders of patents licensed to the company will file  prosecute  extend or maintain their patents in countries where the company has rights 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or will not design around patents issued or licensed to the company 
see business patents and proprietary rights 
government regulation and product approvals 
the research  preclinical and clinical development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of pharmaceuticals  including zadaxin  cpx and the company s other drug candidates  are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities 
products developed by the company cannot be marketed commercially in any jurisdiction in which they have not been approved 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals is lengthy and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in some countries where the company contemplates marketing zadaxin  the regulatory approval process for drugs not previously approved in countries that have established clinical trial review procedures is uncertain and this uncertainty may result in delays in granting regulatory approvals 
the company is currently sponsoring clinical trials and pursuing regulatory approvals of zadaxin in a number of countries and is currently sponsoring clinical trials of cpx in the us  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete such trials  that such trials  if completed  will fulfill regulatory approval criteria or that the company will ultimately obtain approvals in such countries 
adverse results in the company s development programs also could result in the placement of restrictions on the use of zadaxin and  if approved  cpx 
failure to comply with the applicable us or foreign regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in warning letters  fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls or seizures  operating restrictions  injunctions and criminal prosecutions 
further  additional government regulation may be established or imposed which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of zadaxin  cpx or any future products of the company 
see business government regulation 
manufacturing 
the company has entered into contract manufacturing and supply agreements to source zadaxin and cpx 
to be successful  the company s products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
while the company believes it has and will be able in the future to establish and maintain manufacturing relationships with experienced suppliers capable of meeting the company s needs  there can be no assurance that the company will establish and maintain long term manufacturing relationships with suppliers or that these suppliers will prove satisfactory 
the company currently has vialing and packaging supply agreements in effect and has a sufficient supply of finished zadaxin for the near term 
the company has recently changed and upgraded its manufacturing source of finished zadaxin for its international markets  excluding japan 
in certain countries  this change may require additional regulatory approvals 
if regulatory approvals of such manufacturing change  if required  are not obtained in a timely fashion  new zadaxin marketing approvals may be delayed or sales may be interrupted until the manufacturing change is approved 
production interruptions  if they occur  could significantly delay clinical development of potential products  reduce third party or clinical researcher interest and support of proposed clinical trials 
such interruptions could also impede commercialization of the company s products  including sales of zadaxin in approved markets  and impair their competitive position  which would have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the company 
see business manufacturing 
marketing and sales 
the company has established distribution arrangements with local pharmaceutical importers and distribution companies covering countries in asia  latin america and the middle east 
however  no assurance can be given that any such distribution arrangements will remain in place or prove successful 
see business marketing and sales 
technological change and competition 
rapid technological development may result in the company s products becoming obsolete before they are marketed or before the company recovers a significant portion of the related development and commercialization expenses 
competition in the pharmaceutical field is intense and the company expects that competition will increase 
the company s competitors include major pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology firms and universities and other research institutions  both in the us and abroad  that are actively engaged in research and development of products in the therapeutic areas being pursued by the company 
many of these companies and institutions have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and human resource capabilities than the company and extensive experience in undertaking clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals necessary to market drugs 
principal competitive factors in the pharmaceutical field include efficacy  safety  price and therapeutic regimen 
where comparable products are marketed by other companies price is also a competitive factor 
uncertainty of third party reimbursement  resources of patient populations 
the company s ability to successfully commercialize its products may depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of new therapeutic products and there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement will be available for therapeutic products the company might develop 
in many of the foreign countries in which the company intends to operate  reimbursement of zadaxin under government or private health insurance programs will not be available 
in the us  health care reform is an area of increasing national attention and a priority of many governmental officials 
certain reform proposals  if adopted  could impose limitations on the prices the company will be able to charge in the us for its products or the amount of reimbursement for the company s products from governmental agencies or third party payors 
in many countries where the company has marketing rights for zadaxin  government resources and per capita income levels may be so low that the company s products will be prohibitively expensive for a large percentage of the population 
in such countries  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in marketing its products on economically favorable terms  if at all 
dependence on qualified personnel and key individuals 
because of the specialized scientific and international nature of the company s business  the company is highly dependent upon its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified management  scientific and technical personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of the company s activities  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
in addition  many key responsibilities within the company have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals 
loss of the services of any of these individuals unless they were promptly replaced could be significantly detrimental to the company s development 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance on the lives of any of its key personnel 
product liability  absence of insurance 
the company s business will expose it to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products  and there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be asserted against the company 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry generally is expensive to the extent that it is available at all 
the company has product liability insurance coverage for clinical trials and commercial sales 
however  there can be no assurance that a product liability claim would not adversely affect the business or financial condition of the company 
preferred stock 
the company s board of directors has the authority to issue additional series of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  without any further vote or action by the company s shareholders 
the rights of the holders of the common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company invests in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
the company s investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the interest rates the company invests in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of less than years 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease less than in fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
the potential change noted above is based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial positions at december  actual results may differ materially
