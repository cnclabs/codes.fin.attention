item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s business strategy has focused on growth and diversifying its operations through acquisitions 
trico is now the second largest owner and operator of supply boats in the gulf and a leading operator in the north sea 
trico implemented this strategy by acquiring saevik supply in december for a total acquisition cost of approximately million in cash and purchasing  during and  supply boats for use in the gulf at an aggregate cost of million 
the company has also constructed  or is completing the construction of  six new vessels  and has upgraded and refurbished the majority of its gulf supply boat fleet 
the company s newly constructed vessels are specially designed vessels to increase the company s international and deepwater capabilities 
the company s results of operations are affected primarily by day rates and fleet utilization 
demand for the company s vessels is primarily impacted by the level of offshore oil and gas drilling activity  which can be influenced by a number of factors  including oil and gas prices and drilling budgets of exploration and production companies  and  to a lesser extent  the market for the maintenance  repair and salvage of existing platforms 
as a result  trends in oil and gas prices may significantly affect utilization and day rates 
the weakness in oil and gas prices experienced in  which resulted in the lowest price for both oil and gas in recent years  has led to a general decline in activity in most areas of the company s business and has significantly affected the company s results of operations 
day rates and fleet utilization for the company s gulf supply boat fleet have continued to decrease in primarily as a result of decreased drilling and development activity in the gulf 
the company cannot predict when  or if  oil and gas prices will return to levels sufficient to cause industry activity levels to increase 
the company s day rates and utilization rates are also affected by the size  configuration and capabilities of the company s fleet 
in the case of supply boats  psvs and ahtss  the deck space and liquid mud and dry bulk cement capacity are important attributes 
in certain markets and for certain customers  horsepower and dynamic positioning systems are also important requirements 
for crew boats  size and speed are important factors  and in the case of lift boats  longer leg length and greater crane capacity add versatility and marketability 
the company s day rates and utilization can also be affected by the supply of other vessels available in a given market with a similar configuration and capabilities 
the company s operating costs primarily are a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews  maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
generally  increases or decreases in vessel utilization only affect that portion of the company s direct operating costs that is incurred when the vessels are active 
as a result  direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may vary substantially due to changes in day rates and utilization 
in addition to these variable costs  the company incurs fixed charges related to the depreciation of its fleet and costs for the routine drydock inspection  maintenance and repair designed to ensure compliance with us coast guard regulations and to maintain abs certification for its vessels 
maintenance and repair expense and marine inspection amortization charges are generally determined by the aggregate number of drydockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period 
costs incurred for drydock inspection and regulatory compliance are capitalized and amortized over the period between such drydockings  typically two to three years 
results of operations the table below sets forth by vessel class  the average day rates and utilization for the company s vessels and the average number of vessels owned during the periods indicated

comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues for were million  an increase of  compared to million in revenues for this increase was primarily due to the addition  for a full year  of north sea operations that were acquired in december the increase in revenues from the company s north sea operations was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the gulf of mexico  principally due to the decrease in average day rates and utilization for the company s supply boats 
this decrease in supply boat day rates and utilization was the result of reduced industry activity in the gulf 
day rates and utilization for the company s supply boats was also impacted by the market entry of newly constructed vessels  which have increased the competitive environment in the gulf

in  the company added vessels to its total fleet 
in march  the company acquired eight line handling vessels  including one vessel owned by the company s then owned affiliate  that currently operate under charters offshore brazil 
in may with the proceeds from the company s initial public offering  the company acquired four supply boats and in the remainder of  acquired a total of additional supply boats in three separate transactions 
all classes of vessels in the company s fleet reported higher utilization during compared to the greatest increase in utilization was experienced by the company s supply boats and lift boats 
supply boat utilization averaged for  up from for average supply boat day rates for increased to  compared to  for these increases reflected strong market conditions in the gulf during and the substantial downtime incurred in for the vessel upgrade program  during which three of the company s supply boats were lengthened from feet to  one was lengthened from feet to feet  and the boats capacities for liquid mud and bulk cargo were increased 
additionally  the company rebuilt and lengthened a crew boat which was placed in service late in utilization of the company s lift boats increased to for  from during the lift boats experienced unusually low utilization in due to drydocking related downtime and weak market conditions which existed in the first half of the company s lift boats are operated by power offshore  a leading operator of lift boats in the gulf 
management and incentive fees payable to power offshore in totaled  as compared to  for due to the increased revenue and operating income generated by the lift boats 
utilization of the crew boats and line handling vessels increased to for  compared to during the same period in  due to the improved market conditions in the gulf for crew boats and the additional eight line handling vessels acquired in march  which operate under long term charters offshore brazil 
during  direct vessel operating expenses increased to million from million during  due to the expanded vessel fleet and increased labor  repair and maintenance costs 
due to the increase in average vessel day rates  direct vessel operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from during to during depreciation expense increased to million during from million for due to the expanded vessel fleet

liquidity and capital resources the company s business strategy for the past several years has been to enhance its position as a leading supplier of marine support services by pursuing opportunities to acquire vessel fleets and by diversifying into international markets 
primarily as a result of acquisitions  the company s total assets have grown from million at december   to million at december  during and  the company completed the acquisition of saevik supply  a publicly traded norwegian company  for a total acquisition cost of approximately million  including transaction costs  and acquired supply boats in the gulf for million 
the company has also constructed  or is in the process of constructing  six new vessels  to increase its international market presence and increase its deepwater capabilities 
additionally  in  the company completed its vessel upgrade and refurbishment program involving a significant portion of its gulf supply boat fleet 
while this program resulted in significant vessel downtime in  the company believes it has extended the service lives of many of its vessels and has significantly reduced required maintenance spending in the future 
capital expenditures for consisted principally of million for the construction of new vessels and other vessel improvements  and million of us coast guard drydocking and vessel refurbishment costs 
during  million in funds were provided by borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities  million in funds from operating activities and million from the sale of assets

except in certain circumstances  the notes may not be prepaid until august   at which time they may be redeemed  at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to plus accrued and unpaid interest  with the redemption price declining ratably on august of each of the succeeding three years 
the indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  create certain liens  sell assets  or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
the company maintains a bank credit facility that provides up to a million revolving line of credit that can be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility is collateralized by a mortgage on certain of the company s vessels 
amounts borrowed under the bank credit facility mature on december  and bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin that depends on the company s leverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rate for the bank credit facility was as of march  the bank credit facility was amended in december to reduce permitted borrowings to million and increasing to million after june  depending on the company s leverage ratio 
the bank credit facility requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and limits the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  make capital expenditures  pay dividends or make certain other distributions  create certain liens  sell assets or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
although the bank credit facility does impose some limitations on the ability of the company s subsidiaries to make distributions to the company  it expressly permits distributions to the company by the subsidiary guarantors for scheduled principal and interest payments on the notes 
in june  the company refinanced saevik supply s existing bank credit facilities with a revolving credit facility in the amount of nok million  or million the saevik bank facility 
as of march   the company had approximately nok million million of debt outstanding under the saevik bank facility 
the saevik bank facility is collateralized by a security interest in certain of the company s north sea vessels  requires saevik supply to maintain certain financial ratios and limits the ability of saevik supply to create liens  or merge or consolidate with other entities 
amounts borrowed under the saevik bank facility bear interest at nibor norwegian interbank offered rate plus a margin 
the weighted average interest rate for the saevik bank facility was as of march  the commitment amount for the saevik bank facility reduces by nok million million every six months beginning december  with the balance of the commitment to expire in june in connection with the construction of the company s swath vessel  in april the company issued million aggregate principal amount of year  ship financing bonds the ship bonds guaranteed by the united states government 
the ship bonds are due in semi annual installments of principal and interest  with the first principal payment due march   and are secured by a first preferred ship mortgage on the swath vessel and by an assignment of the vessel s charter 
the proceeds of the ship bonds were used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the company s bank credit facility 
due to industry conditions  the company intends to limit capital expenditures to those required to complete existing vessel construction projects and regulatory mandated drydocking costs 
in order to further reduce its maintenance capital expenditures  the company expects to deactivate  or stack  an average of between and of its gulf supply boats during that were not refurbished as part of its vessel upgrade and refurbishment program 
capital expenditures planned for consist primarily of the remaining costs to complete two new vessels currently under construction 
expenditures for the two new vessels in are expected to total approximately million 
the company is completing construction in norway of the northern admiral  a foot  technologically advanced ahts with  horsepower that is scheduled to be delivered in june the company is also completing construction in the gulf of the hondo river  the second of two deepwater foot supply vessels 
the first vessel  the spirit river  was delivered in december  while the hondo river will be completed in the second quarter of the company has a pending application and expects to receive a commitment from the us maritime administration s title xi ship financing program to provide long term financing for approximately million of the cost of the spirit river and the hondo river 
the company believes that cash generated from operations together with available borrowings under its bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company s currently planned capital projects and working capital requirements 
the company s business strategy has historically been to grow through acquisitions to expand its operating capabilities and international operations 
as a result of depressed worldwide oil prices and reduced drilling and development activity in most international areas  the company believes that in it may identify additional acquisition opportunities 
depending upon the size of any acquisition  it is likely that the company would require additional equity financing and may incur additional debt financing in order to complete the acquisition 
the company believes that any such financing would involve the issuance of either common stock  convertible preferred stock or other securities entitling the holders to acquire common stock 
year compliance in accordance with the us securities and exchange commission s sec staff legal bulletin no 
and the sec s subsequent interpretive release  the company has assessed both the cost of addressing and the cost or the consequence of incomplete or untimely resolution of the year yk issue 
this process includes i the development of yk awareness  ii a comprehensive review to identify systems that could be affected by the yk issue  iii an assessment of potential risk factors including non compliance by the company s suppliers  subcontractors and customers  iv the allocation of required resources  v a determination of the extent of remediation work required  vi the development of an implementation plan and time table  and vii the development of contingency plans 
the company  in the normal course of business  is in the process of replacing its accounting and certain other information systems  and has established a target date of mid for their installation at all locations 
while the company s growth is driving the company s efforts to replace these systems  the company does expect the implementation of the new systems to mitigate any potential yk issues related to any of its existing systems 
in addition  the company s information systems personnel are currently working with its third party vendors to resolve the potential problems associated with the year and the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computer and other systems 
the company is still evaluating the yk effect on other computer systems and non information technology systems  including telephone systems  office and vessel based electronic equipment and devices with embedded microprocessors 
additionally  the company has contacted key vendors and suppliers to ensure that they have a yk compliance plan in an effort to minimize the company s exposure to their potential yk problems 
the company anticipates completion of its evaluation of non information technology equipment  key vendors and suppliers and any remedial action and or a contingency plan  if necessary  by mid because of the company s purchase of new software and conversions to new software  the yk issue is not expected to pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems 
however  if such modifications or conversions are not made or are not completed on time  the yk issue could have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
among other things the company could be impacted by the inability of the company to retain qualified personnel and outside consultants to successfully remediate yk issues and implement a new business system as demand for their services rises  the inability of the company s customers to accurately and timely pay invoices  the inability of the company to access necessary capital from lenders or other sources when required  and the inability of the company s significant suppliers  subcontractors and others to provide the necessary materials  services or systems required to operate the company s business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk exposures primarily include interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation on derivative and financial instruments as detailed below 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are classified as other than trading 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the financial activities of the company during the company s exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents estimates of possible changes in fair values  future earnings or cash flows that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
the company s views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and the timing of transactions 
interest rate sensitivity the company has entered into a number of variable and fixed rate debt obligations  denominated in both the us dollar and the norwegian kroner norwegian debt payable in norwegian kroner  as detailed in note to the company s december  financial statements 
these instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
the company manages this risk by monitoring its ratio of fixed and variable rate debt obligations in view of changing market conditions and from time to time altering that ratio by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under its variable rate bank credit facilities with fixed rate debt or by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
as of december  the company had million nok million in variable rate  norwegian denominated debt 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to manage its interest rate exposure on this debt 
the agreement requires the company to pay a fixed rate of interest on a notional amount of principal to a counterparty 
the counterparty  in turn  pays the company a variable rate of interest on the same notional amount of principal 
the effect of the swap is to limit the interest rate exposure to a fixed percentage on the related debt obligation 
as of december   the carrying value of the company s long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  was approximately million  which included the notes million  the ship bonds million and the norwegian fixed rate debt million 
the fair value of this debt was approximately million 
fair value was determined using quoted market prices  where available  or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the balance sheet date 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s long term fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the hypothetical fair values are based on the same assumptions utilized in computing fair values at december  as of december   the carrying value of the company s long term variable rate debt  including accrued interest  was approximately million and included the company s bank credit facility and the saevik bank facility 
the fair value of this debt approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million 
as of december   the company s interest rate swap agreement had a fair value of  based on estimated amounts that the company would receive or pay to terminate the contract at the reporting date 
a hypothetical increase in the pay rate would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  a hypothetical increase in the receive rate would decrease interest expense by a corresponding amount 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity the company s foreign subsidiaries collect revenues and pay expenses in several different foreign currencies 
the company monitors the exchange rate of its foreign currencies and  when deemed appropriate  entries into hedging transactions in order to mitigate the risk from foreign currency fluctuations 
the company also manages its foreign currency risk by attempting to contract foreign revenue in us dollars whenever practicable 
the company has exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from several of its norwegian vessels operating in the united kingdom under long term contracts denominated in the great britain pound gbp 
as of december   the company had approximately million of firmly committed sales contracts through december   denominated in the gbp 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable exchange rates would result in an increase in future cash flows of approximately  a decrease would result in a corresponding decrease in future cash flows 
the company manages this risk through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts would offset the resulting increases decreases in cash flows generated by exchange rate fluctuations of firmly committed sales contracts 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable exchange rates would result in approximately  decrease in future cash flows 
a decrease would result in a corresponding increase in future cash flows 
foreign currency forward exchange contracts had a fair value of  as of december  fair value is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers
