year issue many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
the company s technical personnel are in the process of assessing the impact of the year issue on the company s products and services 
the company has established a two phase program to ensure that its proprietary software and internal computer systems are year compliant 
the initial phase  which included planning  inventory and assessment  has been substantially completed 
the final phase  which consists of correction  testing  deployment and acceptance  is in process and is expected to be completed by mid the company expects that the cost of making its proprietary software and internal systems compliant will be less than  and will not have a material effect on its overall financial position or results of operations 
the company is also beginning the same two phase program to assess the risks to the company of systems owned and operated by outside parties but used by the company in its leased and rented facilities which have embedded technology  such as elevator and telephone systems  security systems  and other physical office infrastructure 
the company is examining infrastructure issues on an office by office basis and the initial phase was completed at the end of no costs have been expended by the company through the final phase is planned to be completed by mid and the company expects to develop contingency plans to address any such embedded technology issues as they are identified 
the company is in the process of communicating with its major clients  subcontractors  banking institution  and payroll vendor to determine whether they are or will be year compliant 
by mid  the company expects to have identified and develop contingency plans for any such clients and vendors who will not be year ready 
even with the effort to address the year issue made by the company to date  there can be no assurance that the systems of other entities on which the company relies  including the company s internal systems and proprietary software  will be timely remediated  or that a failure to remediate by another entity and or the company  would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test software for year modifications 
the total cost associated with the required modifications and conversions is not expected to exceed  including infrastructure and embedded technology see operating risks 
operating risks statements contained in this report which are not historical facts  are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  including those risks and uncertainties discussed below 
history of losses  uncertainty of future profitability 
net earnings loss over the period through were million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in there can be no assurance of the level of earnings  if any  that the company will be able to derive in the future 
reliance on major customers 
during fiscal  two customers  kaiser hill and safe sites  accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues  and during  three customers  kaiser hill  comed  and pg e  accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues of non technologies revenue 
all outstanding customer contracts are cancelable upon notice by either party  and therefore  there can be no assurance that relationships with customers will be maintained at existing levels  or at all 
the discontinuation or material reduction of business relations with any of these customers would have a material adverse impact on tenera s business see item  business marketing and clients 
uncertainty regarding industry trends and customer demand 
as a result of the slowdown in the construction of power plants and the absence of new power plants scheduled for construction  as well as the gradual deregulation of the production and distribution of electricity  the market for engineering services relating to licensing and construction of power plants has contracted  and the market for services related to efficient and profitable operation of existing capacity has expanded 
there can be no assurance that i tenera will have the financial and other resources necessary to successfully research  develop  introduce  and market new products and services  ii if  or when  such new products or services are introduced  they will be favorably accepted by current or potential customers  or iii tenera will be otherwise able to fully adjust its services and products to meet the changing needs of the industry see item  business background 
uncertainty of access to capital 
management currently believes that cash expected to be generated from operations  the company s working capital  and its available loan facility  are adequate to meet its anticipated near term needs 
if cash from operations is less than currently anticipated  tenera may need to seek other sources of capital 
there can be no guarantee that such sources will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms favorable to tenera  or at all 
reliance on key personnel 
due to the nature of the consulting and professional services business  the company s success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of its officers and key technical personnel and the ability to recruit additional qualified personnel 
the company experienced a historically high rate of turnover as revenue and earnings began to decline in and thereafter 
further loss of such officers and technical personnel  and the inability to recruit sufficient additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
government contracts audits 
the company s united states government contracts are subject in all cases to audit by governmental authorities 
in  an audit was concluded  which began in  of certain of its government contracts with the doe relating to the allowability of certain employee compensation costs 
the company made a special charge to earnings in for a million provision for the potential rate adjustments then disputed by the company and the government 
as a result of resolving certain issues in the dispute  the company recognized increases to earnings of  in and  in cash payments to clients associated with the settlement  which are estimated to be between  and  which were accrued for in the special charge to earnings  are expected to be made as government contracts with individual clients are closed out 
there can be no assurance that no additional charges to earnings of the company may result from future audits of the company s government contracts 
competition 
the market for management and consulting services is highly competitive and tenera competes with several larger firms with significantly greater resources 
significant competitive factors in the market for engineering and management services are price and the ability to offer new products and services designed to meet changing customer demand 
a number of tenera s competitors are able to offer such services at prices that are lower than those offered by tenera  and to devote far greater resources toward the development of new products and services 
this competition has had  and is expected to continue to have  a material adverse impact on tenera s business 
year issue 
many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
the company has reviewed the potential problem and believes that it will not have a material impact on its business operations nor its financial condition 
however  if the company s major clients have not addressed their own year issues adequately  especially regarding their accounts payable systems  payment of the company s invoices could be delayed and its cash flow materially affected
