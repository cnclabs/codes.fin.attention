limitations due to debt the indenture imposes significant operating and financial limitations on the company 
such limitations will affect  and in many respects significantly restrict or prohibit  among other things  the ability of the company to pay dividends  make investments and incur additional indebtedness 
these restrictions  in combination with the company s substantial leverage  could limit the ability of the company to effect future financings or otherwise restrict the nature and scope of its activities 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences to company s stockholders and to the holders of the senior notes  including i the impairment of the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future  ii the reduction of funds available to the company for its operations or for capital expenditures as a result of the dedication of a substantial portion of the company s net cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on the senior notes  iii the possibility of an event of default under covenants contained in the indenture  which could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company  iv the placement of the company at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to competitors who are not as highly leveraged as the company  and v vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or its business because of the company s reduced financial flexibility 
in addition  to the extent that the company enters into a bank credit agreement in the future as permitted by and defined in the indenture  such agreement is likely to impose additional operating and financial restrictions on the company  which may be more restrictive than those provided for in the indenture

at t litigation on february   the company filed a lawsuit against at t  which operated an enhanced switching complex for the company the at t complex until december   in the us district court  northern district of texas  dallas division 
the company sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief restraining at t from using and disclosing the company s trade secrets and proprietary information relating to its mobile communications technology 
in september  the company amended its pleadings and filed additional claims against at t related to additional breaches of contract and various tortious activities 
the company sought a declaration that the patents issued to at t using the company s proprietary information were invalid or  alternatively  should be transferred from at t to the company  and that certain actual or threatened at t conduct infringed the company s patents 
the company also brought claims against at t pursuant to the texas deceptive trade practices act dtpa and sought actual  punitive and treble damages and attorneys fees in connection with its claims 
additionally  the company s amended complaint added another defendant  lucent technologies  inc lucent  to which at t transferred certain of the patents at issue in the lawsuit 
in july and october  at t filed counterclaims essentially mirroring the company s claims 
at t sought an injunction preventing the company from using or disclosing at t s alleged trade secrets  a declaratory judgment defining the parties intellectual property rights  actual and punitive damages and attorneys fees in connection with its counterclaims 
in november  at t filed a partial motion to dismiss the company s dtpa claims  various tort claims and the patent invalidity charges 
additionally  in november  lucent filed a motion to dismiss all of the company s claims against lucent 
the court ruled in december on the motions by granting the dismissal of one non essential tort claim against at t and the dismissal of the patent invalidity charges with respect to lucent only on the grounds that lucent has expressed no intent to enforce any of its patents against the company 
on february   the company and at t engaged in a mediation in an effort to resolve all claims between the parties asserted in the litigation 
the company and at t resolved all disputes relating to the litigation in this mediation 
the company and at t have executed a binding memorandum of settlement which will be finalized in a formal joint compromise  release and settlement agreement 
additionally  on march   the company and lucent resolved all disputes related to the litigation in a mediation 
the company and lucent executed a binding memorandum of settlement 
the terms of the settlements with at t and lucent will not adversely impact the company s results of operations or financial position 
uncertainty regarding patents and proprietary rights the company s success depends upon its technology and the scope and limitations of its proprietary rights therein 
in order to protect its technology  the company relies on a combination of patents  copyrights and trade secret laws  as well as certain customer licensing agreements  employee and third party confidentiality and non disclosure agreements and other similar arrangements 
if the company s assertion of proprietary rights is held to be invalid or if another person s use of the company s technology were to occur to any substantial degree  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the patents and other intellectual property rights of the company cannot prevent competitors from developing competing systems using other land based wireless communications systems or using the cellular system through a different method 
while the company believes that the nature and scope of the highwaymaster communications system  including the company s strategic business and technological relationships  would be difficult for a competitor to duplicate  there can be no assurance that a competitor would consider these hindrances to be material in light of the market potential 
a competitor could invest time and resources in an attempt to duplicate certain key features of the company s products and services  which could result in increased competition and have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
several of the company s competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover products or services directly or indirectly related to those offered by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company is aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by its products or services 
in addition  patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and  accordingly  the company cannot evaluate the extent to which its products or services may infringe on future patent rights held by others 
in general  if it were determined that any of the company s products  services or planned enhancements infringed valid patent rights held by others  the company would be required to cease marketing such products or services or developing such enhancements  to obtain licenses which might require the payment of royalties to develop and market such products  services or enhancements from the holders of the patents or to redesign such products or services to avoid infringement 
in such event  the company also might be required to pay past royalties or other damages 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  or that it would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies  without a material adverse effect on its business 
on february   aeris communications  inc filed an original complaint against the company in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that the certain of the company s products may infringe aeris united states patent no 
 aeris has not served the lawsuit pursuant to a standstill agreement reached between the parties 
the parties are currently in negotiations in an effort to resolve the disputes 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to resolve these disputes 
if it were determined that any of the company s products infringed a valid patent held by aeris  the company may be required to cease marketing of such products  to obtain licenses which might require the payment of past and future royalties from aeris or to redesign such products to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  or that it would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies  without a material adverse effect on the company and its business  financial condition and results of operations

products in development the trackware tm product and service described in this form k requires significant development efforts before commercial release 
although the company has executed agreements with cellemetry  llc to utilize its cellemetry r network for the company s trackware tm product and service  various hardware  software and network solutions must be developed for the trackware tm product and service to be successful 
furthermore  the current cellemetry r network must be expanded to include more cellular carriers in order to provide nationwide coverage similar to the company s current service offerings 
there can be no assurance that these steps will be accomplished as currently expected  or at all

dependence on sbc regional service vehicle contract in august  the company entered into an agreement with the sbc companies whereby the sbc companies purchased  mobile units  customized proprietary software and accompanying services from the company for an initial term of one year 
in the first quarter of  the company entered into a second agreement with the sbc companies which extended the initial one year term to three years 
subsequently  the sbc companies ordered an additional  mobile units 
in total  this agreement represents the largest purchase and service contract in the history of the company 
the agreement requires the company to perform certain product modifications and software development for sbc in substantial conformance with the technical specifications of the contract 
the terms of the agreement provide that sbc may receive up to a refund of amounts paid to the company if the company is unable to deliver mobile units and services which substantially comply with the technical specifications of the agreement 
there are no assurances that the company will be able to satisfy the technical specifications of the agreement 
the failure of the company to timely satisfy the functional requirements could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on cellular infrastructure the company utilizes the existing cellular telephone infrastructure  with certain enhancements  as the wireless segment of the highwaymaster network 
in most cases  current terms of contracts between the company and each of its cellular carriers are for one year  with automatic one year successive renewal terms  unless either party elects to terminate the contract upon days notice prior to the end of the term 
the company has recently executed new contracts with certain of its cellular carriers that are substantially similar to the existing contracts  except that they provide for an initial three year term 
in order to continue to provide mobile communications services to its customers  the company must continue to renew its agreements with individual cellular carriers 
if the company is unable to renew or replace its contracts with cellular carriers at competitive rates  the company may be forced to absorb the costs of increased cellular air time rates  or increase rates to customers where allowed by individual contracts 
in general  a failure on the part of the company to renew or replace its contracts with cellular carriers on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the highwaymaster network relies on the continued technical compatibility among its cellular service providers 
currently  cellular carriers primarily utilize analog technology  with digital technology offered in addition to analog in some service areas 
if in the future cellular carriers discontinue all service to analog telephones  the company would be required to dedicate financial resources and engineering staff to integrate a digital cellular telephone transceiver into its products 
although cellular providers have historically cooperated to maintain technical compatibility between markets over time  if substantial changes to the methods of interconnection utilized by cellular carriers occur  such as a discontinuance of the existing out of area call clearing system or a decision by cellular carriers to eliminate analog service and employ several diverse digital technologies rather than a common digital technology  the company may be required to undertake costly system redesign or may encounter difficulty in providing nationwide coverage

dependence on clearinghouse services gte tsi performs certain clearinghouse functions for the company  which include  among other things  validation and verification of roaming numbers and provision of certain call delivery information pursuant to a service agreement dated january  with an initial term of three years 
the company is guaranteed the right to renew the tsi service agreement for up to one year periods beyond the initial term  at a reasonable rate to be determined by gte tsi 
a dispute has arisen relating to the interpretation of certain intellectual property provisions contained in the tsi service agreement and the inventorship of certain patents of the company 
the company and tsi are currently engaged in good faith settlement discussions involving the execution of a new tsi service agreement which contains language more clearly defining the intellectual property rights of the parties and resolving the inventorship issues relating to at least one of the company s patents 
gte tsi and the company have reached a preliminary understanding regarding the resolution of these issues and are working together to draft final agreements 
although there can be no assurance that the dispute will be resolved promptly or favorably to the company  management believes that the company is close to reaching final resolution of this dispute 
eds also performs certain clearinghouse functions for the company which include  among other things  the validation of roaming numbers and routing of call delivery information 
the agreement with eds expires on october  with successive automatic one year renewal terms thereafter  unless terminated at the option of either party upon days notice prior to any expiration date 
there can be no assurance that the eds agreement will be renewed upon expiration 
if the company is unable to renew its agreement with gte tsi or  to a lesser extent  eds  the company may be required to make substantial and costly design changes to the highwaymaster network in order to ensure continued availability of the company s services 
because of the unique position of gte tsi and eds as industry wide clearinghouses and the difficulty associated with their replacement  there can be no assurance that full functionality of the highwaymaster system could be maintained if such a redesign were necessary 
a separate subsidiary of gte  gte wireless  inc gte wireless provides certain other services to the company  principally the direct payment of the company s cellular service providers for cellular airtime through the cellular clearing house process  under a contract which expired on march  as stated above  gte wireless has informed the company that it does not intend to renew its service agreement with the company 
the company has executed an administrative carrier agreement with sbms whereby sbms will replace gte wireless in providing the services 
the company is currently negotiating a transition agreement with gte wireless to effectuate a smooth transition to sbms 
the failure of the company to enter into a transition agreement with gte wireless may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations

costs related to billing discrepancies the company s ability to operate its business on a profitable basis will depend in part upon whether it is able to monitor and control effectively the direct costs of providing services to its customers  including cellular air time charges 
the company periodically analyzes the charges billed to the company by gte wireless on behalf of cellular carriers in order to obtain the appropriate amount of credit for any invalid air time usage charges billed to the company 
furthermore  the company incurs certain valid airtime usage charges that are not billable to customers under current billing practices 
on at least one past occasion  the company has recorded an adjustment to increase cellular airtime cost  a component of cost of service revenue  based on new billing data received 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur significant costs in the future in connection with billing discrepancies  or that the costs will not have an adverse impact on the company s ability to achieve and maintain satisfactory profit margins

no long term product supply arrangements the company does not have the ability to manufacture or assemble its products 
to the extent that the company is dependent on a single supplier to manufacture and assemble the series mobile units and the trackware tm units  the possibility exists that problems experienced by the suppliers could adversely affect the company 
the company has an agreement with k tec electronics corporation k tec for the assembly of the series mobile units 
the company has an agreement with wireless link  inc for the manufacture of the trackware tm units 
the company plans to continue to order series mobile units from k tec and trackware tm units from wireless link 
additionally  the company subcontracts for the manufacture of various components for the series mobile units from various suppliers 
all transceivers for the series mobile units are manufactured by motorola  and the company believes that there is a limited number of suppliers who are capable of manufacturing transceivers that meet the company s requirements 
in general  the failure to maintain or establish satisfactory arrangements for the production and assembly of series mobile units or the trackware tm units could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
control of the company the company  southwestern bell wireless  inc sbw  the erin mills stockholders  the carlyle stockholders  the by word stockholders and certain other persons are parties to an amended and restated stockholders agreement  dated as of september  the amended stockholders agreement which amends and restates in its entirety the stockholders agreement dated february  the parties to the amended stockholders agreement beneficially own an aggregate of  shares of common stock  representing approximately of the shares outstanding as of december  the amended stockholders agreement contains provisions relating to  among other things  the election of members of the company s board of directors 
in particular  this agreement provides that the parties will take all action including the voting of shares of common stock owned by them necessary to ensure that the board of directors of the company consists of i two directors designated by the erin mills stockholders  ii one director designated by the carlyle stockholders  iii two directors designated by the by word stockholders  and iv two independent directors 
each of the parties has designated the number of directors specified in the amended stockholders agreement  except that the carlyle stockholders have declined to exercise their right to designate a director 
prior to the receipt of regulatory relief regulatory relief permitting sbw to provide landline  interlata long distance service pursuant to the communications act of  as amended by the telecommunications act as defined herein  sbw will not be entitled to designate a director  but will have the right to designate a non voting delegate who will attend all meetings of the board of directors and receive all materials distributed to directors of the company 
upon the conversion of series d preferred stock as defined herein into class b common stock as defined herein  which will occur upon receipt of regulatory relief  sbw will be entitled to designate one member of the board of directors of the company 
in addition  if sbw and its affiliates beneficially own or more of the outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis including shares issuable upon conversion or exercise of outstanding options  warrants or rights  but excluding shares issuable upon the conversion or exercise of the certain warrants issued to sbw or of options  warrants or rights issued by any person other than the company  sbw will under certain circumstances be entitled to designate a second member of the board of directors 
as a result of the provisions of the amended stockholders agreement and the number of shares of common stock owned by the stockholders who are parties thereto  these stockholders  if they choose to act together  have the ability to control the management and policies of the company 
repurchase of senior notes upon change of control under the terms of the senior notes  upon the occurrence of a change of control  the company will be required to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding senior notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  to the repurchase date 
there can be no assurance that the company would have sufficient resources to repurchase the senior notes upon the occurrence of a change of control 
the failure to repurchase all of the senior notes tendered to the company would constitute an event of default under the indenture 
furthermore  the repurchase of the senior notes by the company upon a change of control might result in a default on the part of the company in respect of other future indebtedness of the company  as a result of the financial effect of such repurchase on the company or otherwise 
the change of control repurchase feature of the senior notes may have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a merger  tender offer or other takeover attempt 
competition and technological change the company faces competition from numerous other suppliers of mobile communications services 
currently  the company s primary competitors in the long haul trucking market offer data only  two way communications via satellite 
other companies that compete or are planning to compete with the company in its target markets also offer or plan to offer satellite based voice and data communication systems 
the primary advantage of satellite based communication over the company s cellular based system is that satellite coverage is available in certain remote areas and foreign countries that have not developed cellular networks  enabling data transmissions in areas not served by cellular systems 
in addition  satellite based communication systems generally utilize a less complicated infrastructure than the company s network and may be able to make updates and changes to their system more quickly than the company 
certain technological advances and future product offerings could substantially change the nature of the company s competition 
for example  geo stationary orbit  meo and leo satellite systems are expected to offer voice and data communications that could compete directly with existing cellular based services  including the highwaymaster system 
one of the company s current competitors  amsc  launched a geo stationary satellite in and offers both data and voice communications 
in addition  networks of meo and leo satellites are in the early implementation stage  funded by consortiums of companies that intend to provide worldwide voice communication capability 
the addition of voice capability to satellite systems may reduce the company s competitive advantage over certain of its competitors  and it is possible that satellite owners may  at least on a temporary basis  offer rates at or below the company s rates 
certain conventional mobile radio and enhanced smr providers offer digital services that are competitive with current cellular services  including the highwaymaster system 
if enhanced smr providers expand coverage and establish a significant degree of uniformity  through use of proprietary digital technology or otherwise  enhanced smr providers could eventually develop an integrated network to allow nationwide roaming 
enhanced smr operators also offer dispatching services  data transmission and other services through their expanding networks that could compete with the company s services 
one telecommunications company already has implemented a system of nationwide roaming limited to densely populated urban areas where it has built out its network 
several other cellular and pcs carriers are currently in various stages of implementing similar systems 
the cellular industry has developed a uniform standard for incoming call delivery at a reduced cost 
this inexpensive autonomous registration incoming call delivery system for cellular roamers reduces the competitive advantages of the company s system 
moreover  if cellular carriers were to develop additional standard protocol and hardware for inexpensive data transmission and fraud control or if the cost of roaming services were to decline further  other competitive advantages of the company s system would be significantly reduced or lost 
in general  technology in the wireless communications industry is in a rapid and continuing state of change as new technologies and enhancements to existing technologies continue to be introduced 
the company believes that its future success will depend upon its ability to develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs and which anticipate or respond to technological changes on a timely and cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to keep pace with technological developments 
other services are being proposed that could potentially compete with the company s products and services 
the fcc currently is considering whether to allocate megahertz of spectrum in the ghz band to establish dedicated short range communications dsrc systems for the deployment of intelligent transportation systems to provide terrestrial wireless communication links between vehicles traveling at highway speeds and roadside systems 
current dsrc based services include electronic toll payment and commercial vehicle electronic clearance 
emerging dsrc services include en route driver information  freight mobility tracking  traffic control  and automated roadside safety inspection  which may compete with the highwaymaster system 
certain of the company s competitors  including qualcomm have significantly greater name recognition  financial and other resources than the company 
among other things  it appears that certain of these resources have been or are being used by qualcomm and other competitors of the company to subsidize initial hardware purchases and provide extended periods of free services in an attempt to achieve rapid penetration of certain of the company s target markets 
see business competition 
the failure of the company to develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs and which anticipate or respond to technological changes on a timely and cost effective basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of government regulation the company believes that the nature of its services does not require the company to be classified as a common carrier for either wireless or long distance regulatory purposes 
this conclusion is based on several alternative regulatory interpretations 
specifically  the fcc regulates telecommunications service providers or common carriers requiring approval for entry into the marketplace and regulating the service rates offered through tariff filing requirements 
additionally  most state regulatory commissions regulate rate and entry for telecommunications service providers 
in order to encourage growth within the information services segment of the telecommunications industry  the fcc issued an order creating the enhanced services exemption from regulation 
basically  providers of enhanced services are not subject to regulation by the fcc or the various state regulatory agencies 
generally  services qualify as enhanced services if data is transmitted between the provider and customer so that the customer is able to interact with or manipulate the data regardless of whether the services provided include telecommunications transmission components such as cellular or long distance services 
the company believes that the services it provides to its customers in connection with the series and trackware tm units qualify as enhanced services and are exempt from both fcc and state regulation 
alternatively  the company believes that its services may be characterized as a private network not offered to the public at large but offered to specific group of users which also exempts the company from fcc and state regulation 
the company relies on its long distance providers and cellular providers to comply with any regulatory requirements 
the reclassification of the company s services as telecommunications services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the wireless telecommunications industry currently is experiencing significant regulatory changes which may require a re examination of laws and regulations applicable to the company s operations 
the company s services may be characterized by the fcc as cmrs 
if the company s services are classified as cmrs  the company would subject to fcc regulation as telecommunications service provider 
however  the fcc has decided to forbear from most regulation of the cmrs marketplace  including regulation of the rates and terms of entry for interstate services offered by cmrs providers 
in addition  congress has preempted state regulation of cmrs entry and rates 
recent fcc decisions have enhanced the development of cmrs  including requiring local telephone companies to offer interconnection and access to their networks to cmrs providers and to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements with cmrs providers for the transportation and termination of calls at prices that are cost based and just and reasonable 
if any services offered by the company are determined to be telecommunications services by the fcc  the revenues generated from these services would be subject to the federal universal service fund contribution tax 
at this time  revenues generated from the company s services which meet the definition of enhanced services are not subject to fcc mandated universal service fund contribution 
however  based on a conservative interpretation the company has reported certain revenues generated by the personal calling plan service offered by the company as a telecommunications service for purposes of federal universal service fund contribution filings 
various states have instituted their own universal service fund mechanisms which may or may not follow the federal statues in exempting revenues generated by enhanced services 
the company cannot predict the impact of any requirement to contribute to state and federal universal service mechanisms 
long distance providers face regulatory schemes similar to cellular carriers  with greater state involvement in requiring posting of bonds as security against customer deposits and in other matters 
the company believes current long distance regulations apply to the companies providing long distance services directly to company customers  without long distance regulatory involvement by the company 
the reclassification of the company s services as long distance services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in february  the telecommunications act of was signed into law 
this is the most comprehensive set of telecommunications laws to be enacted since the original communications act of was passed 
the telecommunications act encourages competition in virtually every arena of communications and eliminates many regulatory barriers to new competitors by  in some instances  preempting state and local restrictions 
the telecommunications act requires the fcc to extensively revise many of the rules and regulations under which the telecommunications industry has been operating 
to that end  the fcc has completed approximately different proceedings in connection with the telecommunications act 
at this time  it is unclear how the telecommunications act will affect the activities of the company  its strategic business relationships with other communications companies  or its customers 
there can be no assurance that the relaxing of barriers to competition in the industry will not hinder the company s growth and viability in the marketplace 
dependence on key personnel the company is dependent on the efforts of jana bell  president and chief executive officer  bill mccausland  senior vice president operations  michael smith  executive vice president and chief financial officer  todd felker  senior vice president sales marketing and a group of employees with technical knowledge regarding the company s systems 
the loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially and adversely affect the business of the company and its future prospects 
the company has employment agreements with ms 
bell  and messrs 
mccausland  smith and felker 
ms 
bell  and messrs 
mccausland  smith and felker may each terminate their employment agreements upon days written notice 
the company does not maintain key man life insurance on any of the company s officers or employees 
the company s future success will also depend on its ability to attract and retain additional management and technical personnel required in connection with the growth and development of its business 
year software risk the company has established a year project team  which includes employees with various functional responsibilities and outside consultants 
the project team has identified five phases in becoming year compliant i awareness  locating  listing and prioritizing specific technology that is potentially subject to year challenges  ii assessment and determining the element of risk that exists through inquiry  research and testing  iii resolving year related issues that were identified in previous phases by repair in a testing environment  iv validation testing  monitoring  obtaining certification and verifying the correct manipulation of dates and date related data  including systems of material third parties  and v implementation  installation  integration  and application of year ready resolutions by replacement  upgrade or repair of technology systems  including those of material third parties 
the company is performing its year analysis on all systems located at the company as well as some located at customer sites 
in addition to internally controlled operating systems  the company relies on third parties for services and or goods that may be affected by year challenges 
the company is in the process of obtaining assurances from third parties that their systems are or will be year compliant in a timely manner 
while the company does not anticipate delays or postponements in implementing year resolutions in a timely manner  there can be no certainty that implementation of solutions will be made in a timely manner until the validation phase is completed 
the inability to address all issues in a timely and successful manner could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the failure of third parties to provide year compliant products and or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
such risks include  but are not limited to  inability to deliver or receive calls and or data  failure to accurately report and bill existing customers  accept new orders and the inability to perform other customer care tasks 
management believes the cost of becoming year compliant will be approximately  during although the company does not expect the cost to have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant unanticipated costs in relation to its readiness obligations 
the company has not deferred any specific projects  goals or objectives relating to its operations as a result of year compliance efforts 
expansion risk to the extent that the company is successful in implementing its business strategy  the company may experience periods of rapid expansion in the future 
in order to manage growth effectively in the complex environment in which it operates  the company will need to maintain and improve its operating and financial systems and expand  train and manage its employee base 
in addition  the company must carefully manage production and inventory levels to meet product demand and facilitate new product introductions 
inaccuracies in demand forecasts could result in insufficient or excessive inventories and disproportionate overhead expenses 
the company must also expand the capacity of its sales  distribution and installation networks in order to achieve continued growth in its existing and future markets 
in general  the failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
customer concentration ameritruck distribution corporation  burlington motor carriers  contract freighters  inc  the sbc companies and wal mart stores east  inc 
collectively accounted for approximately of the company s installed base of mobile units as of december  the loss of any of these customers  or any event  occurrence or development which adversely affects the relationship between the company and any of these customers  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability testing  manufacturing and use of the company s products entail the risk of product liability 
although management believes the series mobile unit offers safety advantages over conventional cellular telephones  it is possible that operation of the product may give rise to product liability claims 
product liability claims present a risk of protracted litigation  substantial money damages  attorney s fees  costs and expenses  and diversion of management attention 
in addition  as the company expands its business to include the provision of alarm monitoring services in connection with the sbc regional service vehicles contract  the company is exposed to an increased risk of litigation regarding various safety  performance and other matters 
product liability claims which exceed policy limits applicable to the company s liability insurance or which are excluded from the policy coverage could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
common stock available for purchase by sbw pursuant to a purchase agreement dated september  the purchase agreement  and certain agreements and instruments related thereto  the company issued to sbw i  shares of series d preferred stock and ii the warrants 
the shares of series d preferred stock issued to sbc are initially convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at the option of sbw 
the warrants generally entitle sbw to purchase from the company i  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and ii  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  in each case subject to adjustment to prevent dilution 
if all of the shares of series d preferred stock were converted into common stock and all the warrants were exercised by sbw  sbw would hold approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock based on the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of december  
certain rights of sbw the purchase agreement and certain of the other agreements and instruments related thereto afford various rights to sbw that are not available to the other stockholders of the company 
for example  the company has granted to sbw  as the holder of series d preferred stock  the right to approve certain actions on the part of the company  including i mergers or consolidations involving the company that require stockholder approval under the general corporation law of the state of delaware the dgcl  ii sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the company that require stockholder approval under the dgcl  iii amendments to the company s certificate of incorporation  iv the dissolution of the company  v the adoption  implementation or acceptance by the company of certain anti takeover provisions  vi the issuance by the company of equity securities  including securities convertible into equity securities subject to specified exceptions and the incurrence by the company of debt obligations in an amount exceeding million in any year  vii the company entering into any line of business other than its existing line of business or entering into joint ventures  partnerships or similar arrangements which would require expenditures of more than million  viii the disposition by the company in any month period of assets other than assets sold in the ordinary course of business of which the fair market value exceeds million  and ix any amendment  alteration or repeal of the terms of the series d preferred stock 
dividend policy the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future

during the third quarter  the company halted the development of the autolink r program and made a number of key management and structural changes designed to more closely align the company s expenditures with its revenues 
based on the company s projected operating results  after considering these changes  the company believes its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its currently anticipated operating needs and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
however  the company s future cash flow from operations and operating requirements may vary depending on a number of factors  including the rate of installation of mobile units  the level of competition  success of new products  general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
the company s capital resources may be insufficient to fund its operating needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements in the long term 
the company believes that  in order to address its long term capital requirements  it will need to take steps to i increase the installed base of mobile units in service and improve the efficiency of its operations  so as to reduce or eliminate its operating losses  or ii obtain additional sources of debt or equity financing 
the company s ability to obtain additional debt financing is materially restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the senior notes 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms  if at all

the company is performing its year analysis on all systems located at the company as well as some located at customer sites 
in addition to internally controlled operating systems  the company relies on third parties for services and or goods that may be affected by year challenges 
the company is in the process of obtaining assurances from third parties that their systems are or will be year compliant in a timely manner 
while the company does not anticipate delays or postponements in implementing year resolutions in a timely manner  there can be no certainty that implementation of solutions will be made in a timely manner until the validation phase is completed 
the inability to address all issues in a timely and successful manner could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the failure of third parties to provide year compliant products and or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
such risks include  but are not limited to  inability to deliver or receive calls and or data  failure to accurately report and bill existing customers  accept new orders  and the inability to perform other customer care tasks 
management believes the cost of becoming year compliant will be approximately  during although the company does not expect the cost to have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant unanticipated costs in relation to its readiness obligations 
the company has not deferred any specific projects  goals  or objectives relating to its operations as a result of year compliance efforts
