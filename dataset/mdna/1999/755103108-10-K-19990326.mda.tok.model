the forward looking statements contained in this form k are within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s wet friction operation expects to continue to face an increasingly competitive automotive environment and a slowdown for the demand in certain agricultural machine products 
our major customers in the automotive industry face an increased competitive automotive environment which is likely to continue to limit raytech s pricing flexibility in the near term 
in addition  the weakness of the japanese yen and other asian currencies against the us dollar and the continued deterioration in the asian economies could result in substantial increases in imports from asia to the us and canada 
the asian economic difficulties could have an unfavorable effect on overall economic conditions in the us and canada  where our major customers sales are concentrated 
with regard to the company s agricultural equipment operations  worldwide farm commodity prices continue on a downward course as a result of prospects for increased global supplies of grains and oilseeds  as well as fears about the asian economic crisis 
accordingly  retail demand for agricultural equipment in is now projected to decline by percent in north america  by percent in europe and by percent in latin america and australia 
in light of this outlook and the company s continuing commitment to aggressive asset management  production schedules are being reviewed for to ensure the company s production meets demand 
the aftermarket operation is expected to remain constant compared to results for the competition in this market continues to increase as mergers continue to occur between suppliers 
the sales growth in this segment has been the result of new product introduction in filters and planetary gears over the past years 
evaluating new products for this market is a key element in the strategy 
the dry friction operation continues to operate in a sluggish european environment with unemployment remaining at high levels and economic growth improving only marginally 
the development of new market opportunities in asia is supported through the new production facility in china 
the overall asian economy continues to be negatively affected by the weakened economies of japan and other asian countries 
the company s outlook for anticipates modest growth over results 
increased market share in the automotive original equipment market and the continued introduction of new products for aftermarket distribution are expected to be the drivers for performance 
further  it is anticipated that the dry friction operation in china will improve the performance of this segment 
year the company s year program addresses major assessment areas that include information systems  mainframe computers  personal computers  the distributed network  the shop floor  facilities systems  the company s products  product research and development facilities  and the readiness of the company s suppliers and distribution network 
the program includes the following phases identification and assessment  business criticality analysis  project work prioritization  compliance plan development  remediation and testing  production implementation  and contingency plan development for mission critical systems 
the company s objective is to become year compliant with its mission critical activities and systems by mid  allowing substantial time for further testing  verification and the final conversion of less important systems 
the company continues to be on schedule in its plans to accomplish this objective and has initiated infrastructure and information systems modifications to ensure that both hardware and software systems are compliant 
the company also is requesting assurances from its significant suppliers and dealers that they are addressing this issue to ensure there will be no major disruptions 
the total cost of the modifications and upgrades to date are approximately million and should not exceed million 
although no assurances can be given as to the company s compliance  particularly as it relates to third parties  the company does not expect that either future costs of modifications or the consequences of any unsuccessful modifications will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  the failure to correct a material year problem could result in the interruption of certain normal business activities and operations 
the company s most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that the year noncompliance of a critical third party  such as an energy supplier  could cause the supplier to fail to delivery  with the result that production is interrupted at one or more facilities 
such a disruption in production could result in lost sales or profits 
however  the company is reviewing the need to develop contingency plans  which should be determined by early  should any year failures occur in any of the assessment areas noted above 
euro conversion the company is well advanced in the process of identification  implementation and testing of its systems to adopt the euro currency in its operations affected by this change

as a result  the company expects to have its systems ready to process the euro conversion during the transition period from january  through january  the cost of information systems modifications  effects on product pricing and purchase contracts  and the impact on foreign currency financial instruments are not expected to be material 
financial risks the company maintains lines of credit with united states and foreign banks  as well as other creditors detailed in note f debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is naturally exposed to various interest rate risk and foreign currency risk in its normal course of business 
the company is fortunate to operate in an environment which allows for effective management of its accounts receivable as evidenced by the average days sales in trade receivables of days 
this allows for minimum borrowings in supporting unusual inventory and trade receivable growth due to increased sales 
management does not anticipate a significant change in fiscal policy in any of its borrowing markets in given current economic conditions 
further  the company can reduce the short term impact of interest rate fluctuation through deferral of capital investment should the need arise 
the rates of interest on the various debt agreements range from to 
the company has not entered into any interest rate management programs such as interest rate swaps or other derivative type transactions 
the amount of exposure which could be created by increases in rates is not considered significant by management 
the local currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries have been designated as the functional currencies 
accordingly  financial statements of foreign operations are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate in effect during the year for revenues and expenses 
the company does not believe that the fluctuation in foreign currency will have a material adverse effect on the company s overall financial condition 
additionally  the company does not enter into agreements to manage any currency transaction risks due to the immaterial amount of transactions of this type

future liquidity since the formation of raytech and the restructuring that occurred in  raytech has been named a co defendant in approximately  asbestos related lawsuits as a successor in liability to raymark 
until february  the defense of all such lawsuits was provided to raytech by raymark in accordance with the indemnification agreement included as a condition of the purchase of the wet clutch and brake division and the german subsidiary from raymark in in february  an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against raymark  and subsequently  a restrictive insurance funding order was issued by an illinois court denying defense costs  and another raymark insurance carrier had been declared insolvent 
these circumstances caused raymark to be unable to fund the costs of defense to raytech in the asbestos related lawsuits referenced above 
in an asbestos related personal injury case decided in october in a us district court in oregon  raytech was ruled under oregon equity law to be a successor to raymark s asbestos related liability 
the successor ruling was appealed by raytech and in october  the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court s judgment on the grounds stated in the district court s opinion 
the effect of this decision extends beyond the oregon district due to a third circuit court of appeals decision in a related case cited below wherein raytech was collaterally estopped precluded from relitigating the issue of its successor liability for raymark s asbestos related liabilities  and a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the us supreme court in october as the result of the inability of raymark to fund raytech s costs of defense recited above and in order to obtain a ruling binding across all jurisdictions as to whether raytech is liable as a successor for asbestos related and other claims  including claims yet to be filed relating to the operations of raymark and its predecessors  on march   raytech filed a petition seeking relief under chapter of title  united states code in the united states bankruptcy court  district of connecticut 
under chapter  substantially all litigation against raytech has been stayed while the debtor corporation and its non filed operating subsidiaries continue to operate their businesses in the ordinary course under the same management and without disruption to employees  customers and suppliers 
in june raytech filed a class action in the bankruptcy court against all present and future asbestos claimants seeking a declaratory judgment that it not be held liable for the asbestos related liabilities of raymark 
it was the intent of raytech to have this case heard in the us district court  and since the authority of the bankruptcy court is referred from the us district court  upon its motion and argument the us district court withdrew its reference of the case to the bankruptcy court and thereby agreed to hear and decide the case 
in september  the us district court issued a ruling dismissing one count of the class action citing as a reason the preclusive effect of the oregon case under the doctrine of collateral estoppel conclusiveness of judgment in a prior action  in which raytech was ruled to be a successor to raymark s asbestos liability under oregon law 
the remaining counts before the us district court involve the transfer of raymark s asbestos related liabilities to raytech on the legal theories of alter ego and fraudulent conveyance 
upon a motion for reconsideration  the us district court affirmed its prior ruling in february also  in february  the us district court transferred the case in its entirety to the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
such transfer was made by the us district court without motion from any party in the interest of the administration of justice as stated by the us district court 
in december  raytech filed a motion to activate the case and to obtain rulings on the remaining counts which was denied by the us district court 
in october  the creditors committee asked the court to certify the previous dismissal of the successor liability count 
in february  the us district court granted the motion to certify and the successor liability dismissal was accordingly appealed 
in may  the third circuit court of appeals ruled that raytech is collaterally estopped precluded from relitigating the issue of its successor liability as ruled in the oregon case recited above  affirming the us district court s ruling of dismissal 
a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the us supreme court in october the ruling leaves the oregon case  as affirmed by the ninth circuit court of appeals  as the prevailing decision holding raytech to be a successor to raymark s asbestos related liabilities 
in october  raytech reached a tentative settlement with its creditors and entered into a memorandum of understanding with respect to achieving a consensual plan of reorganization the plan 
the parties to the settlement include raytech  the official creditors committee  the guardian ad litem for future claimants  the connecticut department of environmental protection and the us department of justice  environmental and natural resources division 
substantive economic terms of the memorandum of understanding provide for all general unsecured creditors  including but not limited to all asbestos and environmental claimants to receive  through a trust established under the bankruptcy code  of the equity in a company to be reorganized reorganized raytech and any and all refunds of taxes paid or net reductions in taxes owing resulting from the transfer of equity to the trust  and existing equity holders in raytech to receive of the equity in reorganized raytech 
substantive non economic terms of the memorandum of understanding provide for the parties to jointly work to achieve a consensual plan  to determine an appropriate approach to related pension and employee benefit plans and to cease activities that have generated adverse proceedings in the bankruptcy court 
the parties have also agreed to jointly request a finding in the confirmation order to the effect that while raytech s liabilities appear to exceed the reasonable value of its assets  the allocation of of the equity to existing equity holders is fair and equitable by virtue of the benefit to the estate of resolving complicated issues without further costly and burdensome litigation and the risks attendant therewith and the economic benefits of emerging from bankruptcy without further delay 
the adverse ruling in the third circuit court of appeals  of which a petition for writ of certiorari was denied by the us supreme court  precluding raytech from relitigating the issue of its successor liability leaves the us district court s oregon ruling as the prevailing decision holding raytech to be a successor to raymark s asbestos related liabilities 
this ruling could have had a material adverse impact on raytech as it did not have the resources needed to fund raymark s potentially substantial uninsured asbestos related and environmental liabilities 
however  the tentative settlement between raytech and its creditors as recited in the memorandum of understanding referenced above has defined the impact of the successor liabilities imposed by the referenced court decisions 
while an outline of principles in the memorandum of understanding has been agreed to by raytech and its creditors  a consensual plan of reorganization must still be written and agreed to and is subject to review and confirmation by the bankruptcy court  which at this time cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the memorandum of understanding not result in a confirmed plan of reorganization  the ultimate liability of the company with respect to asbestos related  environmental  or other claims would remain undetermined 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern  which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the uncertainties regarding the reorganization proceedings raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability  revaluation and classification of recorded asset amounts or adjustments relating to establishment  settlement and classification of liabilities that may be required in connection with reorganizing under the bankruptcy code
