results of operations operating income  which excludes net realized gains and losses from security sales and one time items  was million  or per share  in  million  or per share  in and million  or per share  in the gaap combined ratio was in  in and in direct premiums written increased to  million in  compared to  million in and  million in net premiums written increased to  million in  compared to  million in and  million in the difference between direct and net premiums written is partially attributable to premiums written under state mandated involuntary commercial auto insurance procedures caip  for which the company retains no indemnity risk  of million in  million in and million in the company provided policy and claim processing services to state caips in all three years 
premiums earned  which are a function of the amount of premiums written in the current and prior periods  increased in  compared to in and in net premiums written in the company s personal lines  which write insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreational vehicles  grew  and in  and  respectively  primarily reflecting an increase in unit sales 
the slower growth in is a result of intensified competition in the auto insurance market 
many of the company s competitors reduced rates  increased advertising  entered new states  expanded their distribution channels  entered the nonstandard auto insurance market and increased agents compensation 
the company expects continued growth in despite increased competition 
the company decreased rates an average of in  compared to rate decreases of 
in and rate increases of in the company continues to write through multiple distribution methods  including independent agents  direct via auto pro r and progressive 
com and through strategic alliances 
in  the direct distribution channel represented between and of the personal lines volume  compared to between and in and less than in the sales generated via the internet represented approximately of the direct business net premiums written in the company also writes through its strategic alliances channel  which includes alliances with other insurance companies  employers  affinity groups and national brokerage agencies 
the strategic alliances channel represented between and of the personal lines premiums in all three years 
the remainder of the personal lines premiums are written through a network of over  independent insurance agents 
through these multiple distribution channels  the company continues to write standard and preferred risks  which represented between and of total personal lines volume  compared to between and in and between and in  as well as its traditional nonstandard auto products 
in  the company began using rating criteria based partially on consumer financial responsibility 
this approach is in use in states that represent of the personal lines volume 
the company expects product design and pricing methods to evolve constantly  based on the developing understanding of loss data  work flows  market conditions and technology  as well as consumer acceptance of the progressive brand as an insurer for all drivers 
the company introduced the next generation of product design in mid and expects to have it in markets representing of premium by april early results suggest that the company is attracting drivers from all risk profiles and retaining them longer 
the company believes that growing the numbers of policyholders  particularly standard and preferred risks with their higher retention rates  builds intrinsic value because renewals are more profitable than first year business 
the drive to add customers faster resulted in more spending to promote the progressive brand and to hire and develop more claim adjusters and customer service representatives  and the company expects this to continue at least in the near term 
these costs  along with lower margins on first year business  are expected to bring profit margins more in line with the company s objective of achieving a underwriting profit margin over the entire retention period of a policyholder 
in  personal lines generated an underwriting profit margin of  compared to in and in the company s other lines of business include writing insurance for small fleets of commercial vehicles  collateral protection and loan tracking for auto lenders and financial institutions  directors and officers liability and fidelity coverage for american bankers association member community banks and independent credit unions  and providing related claim  underwriting and system services 
revenues in these businesses were million in  compared to million in and million in pretax operating profit was million in  compared to million in and million in most of these businesses are in markets that are declining in size 
claim costs  the company s most significant expense  represent actual payments made and changes in estimated future payments to be made to or on behalf of its policyholders  including expenses required to settle claims and losses 
these costs include a loss estimate for future assignments and assessments  based on current business  under state mandated involuntary automobile programs 
claim costs are influenced by inflation and loss severity and frequency  the impact of which is mitigated by adequate pricing 
increases in the rate of inflation increase loss payments  which are made after premiums are established 
accordingly  anticipated rates of inflation are taken into account when the company establishes premium rates and loss reserves 
claim costs  expressed as a percentage of premiums earned  were in  compared to in and in in recent years  the industry has had favorable loss experience driven by continuing trends with respect to safer cars and roads  the impaired driving crackdown  better law enforcement and insurers operating more efficiently 
the company writes directors and officers and other professional liability coverage for community banks and credit unions and  therefore  could potentially be exposed to liability for errors made by these institutions relating to the year conversion 
to minimize its risk  from october through may  the company included year exclusions in all new and renewal policies for commercial banks which have multi year terms that extend beyond december  this placed the company at a competitive disadvantage since few of its competitors included similar exclusions 
the company has obtained additional reinsurance to limit its potential exposure to about of the average policy limits in the event any of the insured directors or officers are held liable for year noncompliance by their financial institutions 
in light of this additional reinsurance contract  which reduced the company s net exposure by and covers all of the company s in force directors and officers insurance business  in june  the company stopped including year exclusions in its multi year policies 
additionally  the company has begun to selectively remove previously issued year exclusions 
as a regulated industry  financial institutions are under pressure from government regulatory agencies and other interested parties to ensure they achieve readiness for the year the company is monitoring its customers compliance efforts and believes that substantially all such customers are pursuing plans to achieve year compliance 
it is currently unknown whether these financial institutions will be able to completely avoid errors relating to year compliance and the company is unable to predict to what extent such financial institutions will incur losses as a result of noncompliance and whether their directors and officers will be subject to individual liability for such noncompliance 
in the event of a claim  applicable factual and coverage issues would have to be resolved 
based on information currently available and management s best estimate  the company does not believe that any losses resulting from this exposure will have a material impact on the company s liquidity  financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
because the company is primarily an insurer of motor vehicles  it has limited exposure for environmental  product and general liability claims 
the company has established reserves for these exposures  in amounts which it believes to be adequate based on information currently known by it 
management does not believe that these claims will have a material impact on the company s liquidity  financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums earned were in and and in during  the company expanded its television advertising campaign on a national level 
the company also introduced its local advertising campaign to more states during  bringing the total number of states in which the company advertises to plus washington dc markets 
recurring investment income interest and dividends increased to million in  compared to million in and million in  primarily due to an increase in the size of the investment portfolio 
net realized gains on security sales were million in  million in and million in investment expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in  in  the company purchased a new portfolio management system and incurred expenses related to the sale of the commercial mortgage backed securities 
year compliance the year problem exists because many computer programs only use the last two digits to refer to a year and could recognize as instead of if not corrected  many computer and other microchip supported applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the extent of the potential impact is still unknown but could affect the global economy 
in response to this issue  the company has evaluated its applications and operating software including its claims reporting  financial reporting  policy issuance  policy maintenance and other internal production systems  hardware and software products  and third party data exchanges and business relationships  and is in the process of evaluating its end user computing activities and facilities implications including public utility services  and has established a dedicated  tenured project team responsible for overseeing progress on the company s compliance program and periodically reporting to management 
the company began converting its applications software to be year compliant in july and  as a result  has been able to avoid redeploying significant resources or deferring other important projects to specifically address the year issues 
during the first quarter  the company retained independent consultants to determine its state of readiness 
although some additional areas of focus were identified  the consultants noted that the company was adequately addressing its critical internal systems and issues 
as of december   the company has completed approximately of its efforts to bring its applications software in compliance 
testing of critical applications is being accomplished through the use of a special systems environment known as a time warp lab  which mimics the company s production environment 
as a final test of year readiness  after conversion and year certification  critical applications are run in the time warp lab while systems clocks turn over from to and beyond 
the total cost to modify these existing production systems  which includes both internal and external costs of programming  coding and testing  is estimated to be million  of which million had been expensed through december  the company also replaced some of its systems during in addition to being year compliant  these new systems added increased functionality to the company 
the total cost of these systems  which include both internal and external costs  is estimated to be million  and the majority of the projects were completed in  with remaining parallel testing scheduled during the first quarter as of december   million had been paid for these systems 
all costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
in addition  the company has identified approximately third parties with which data is exchanged 
all critical data exchanges are being tested for compliance 
although dependent on business partners testing schedules  testing of critical data exchanges is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter the company continually evaluates computer hardware and software upgrades for enhancements and  therefore  many of the costs to replace these items to be year compliant are not likely to be incremental costs to the company 
the company s remediation of its mainframe hardware and operating software is complete and the remediation of its servers and client server operating software is complete 
the company estimates that all mainframe and client server hardware and operating software will be year compliant by the first half of in addition  during  the company secured software which will assist in the discovery of noncompliant desktop hardware and software 
it is estimated that the assessment and remediation process will be completed by the first half of the company is currently unable to determine the impact that year noncompliance may have on its financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the company believes that it is taking the necessary measures to address issues that may arise relating to the year and that its production systems will be compliant 
the company realizes  however  that noncompliance by third parties could impact its business 
the possibility exists that a portion of the company s distribution channel may not be compliant  that communication with agents could be disrupted  that underwriting data  such as motor vehicle reports  could be unobtainable  that the claim settling process could be delayed or that frequency and severity of losses may increase due to external factors 
the company is contacting its key independent insurance agents  vendors and suppliers eg banks  credit bureaus  motor vehicle departments  rating agencies  etc 
to determine their status of compliance and to assess the impact of noncompliance to the company 
the company is working closely with all critical business relationships to minimize its exposure to year issues  including on site visits to identify their state of readiness 
the company s process teams and business groups are identifying potential year scenarios 
for those scenarios deemed to be both probable and with a potentially significant business impact  the company is developing contingency plans 
the majority of the contingency plans are drafted and were reviewed by the company s chief financial and technology officers during contingency plans may include such items as hardening facilities with back up generators  prioritizing resources  securing alternative vendors  developing alternative processes  pre ordering policyholder information  and other measures 
the contingency plans were substantially completed for all material relationships during the first quarter and the company will continue to review them throughout safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of except for historical information  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  pricing competition and other initiatives by competitors  legislative and regulatory developments  weather conditions including the severity and frequency of storms  hurricanes  snowfalls  hail and winter conditions  driving patterns  court decisions and trends in litigation  interest rate levels and other conditions in the financial and securities markets  unforeseen technological issues associated with the year compliance efforts and the extent to which vendors  public utilities  governmental entities and other third parties that interface with the company may fail to achieve year compliance  and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s sec reports
