item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide pcs services in the southeastern united states under the name powertel and cellular telephone service in contiguous portions of eastern alabama and western georgia under the name intercel 
our pcs licenses encompass a territory of approximately  contiguous square miles with a population of approximately million people 
we hold licenses to serve the atlanta  georgia mta  the jacksonville  florida mta  the memphis  tennessee jackson  mississippi mta and the birmingham  alabama mta and btas in kentucky and tennessee 
we hold mhz of spectrum licensed for pcs in the mta markets  and we hold mhz of spectrum licensed for pcs in all of the bta markets except for the knoxville  tennessee bta  where we hold a license for mhz of spectrum 
we have one of the largest contiguous licensed pcs footprints in the southeastern united states 
we introduced our pcs services in october in jacksonville  florida and montgomery  alabama and  to date  have launched our pcs services in a total of markets in the southeast 
as of december   we had approximately  postpaid pcs subscribers and  prepaid pcs subscribers 
on march   we agreed  subject to certain conditions  to sell of our communications towers to a subsidiary of crown castle international corp 
for an aggregate of million in cash 
the purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the actual number of towers tendered at the closing 
in connection with this sale  we agreed to lease space on the towers that we are selling for a period of ten years  with three five year renewal periods that we may exercise at our option 
we expect to close this transaction in the second quarter of in addition  on january   we agreed to sell substantially all of our cellular assets to public service cellular  inc for million in cash 
we expect to close this transaction in the second quarter of as well 
as of december   we had approximately  cellular subscribers 
average revenues per subscriber in the wireless industry have declined during recent quarters and are expected to continue to gradually decline in the future 
we believe this downward trend is the result of the addition of lower usage customers who utilize wireless service for personal convenience  security or as backup for their traditional landline telephones 
in addition  we expect that revenue per minute will continue to decline as competition within the wireless industry intensifies 
we believe the effect of this trend on our earnings will be mitigated by corresponding increases in the number of wireless subscribers and the use of enhanced services that are offered to pcs subscribers 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   as a result of the significant costs required to build out and maintain our pcs system  the hiring and management of required personnel to operate our pcs business and market our services  the subsidization of pcs handsets to our customers and the depreciation of pcs equipment and amortization of the pcs licenses 
we expect to continue incurring significant operating losses during and thereafter as we continue to build out our pcs system  develop our pcs customer base and subsidize the cost of pcs handsets to our customers 
minimizing customer attrition  or churn  becomes a greater challenge as the subscriber base grows and the wireless marketplace becomes more competitive 
we generated an average monthly churn rate of and for our cellular and pcs businesses  respectively  for the year ended december  we remain committed to reducing our pcs churn rate in the future through more focused collections efforts  stricter credit evaluation policies  implementation of fraud prevention tools  a proactive customer retention program and alternative methods of payment 
in september  we also introduced an intelligent  network based prepaid service for credit challenged customers 
despite these efforts  we expect that ongoing pcs churn rates could be higher than historical churn rates for cellular carriers as more competitors and competitive services continue to enter the marketplace 
additionally  the ability of pcs subscribers to activate service via the phone over the air activation without any face to face contact with our representatives increases our susceptibility to subscription fraud  which ultimately results in churn 
the company is a member of the gsm alliance  a consortium of pcs carriers which offer gsm based pcs service throughout north america 
all members of the alliance have executed roaming agreements with each other  which allows gsm customers to roam throughout many major metropolitan areas in the united states and canada 
additionally  we have signed several international roaming agreements and expect to sign numerous others with international gsm carriers to facilitate international roaming

         capital expenditures          a we did not commence pcs operations until fourth quarter year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following discussion reflects the results of operations for our pcs and cellular lines of business 
all general corporate costs have been allocated to those lines of business based on management s estimates of actual expenses incurred related to such lines of business 
postpaid service revenues increased million  or  for as compared to pcs postpaid service revenues increased million in  or  primarily as a result of our continued subscriber growth and our launch of seven new pcs markets  including atlanta  georgia  since the fourth quarter of our postpaid pcs subscribers grew to approximately  at december   from approximately  at december  cellular postpaid service revenues decreased million  or  primarily as a result of the sale of our cellular operations in the state of maine during the second quarter of and the corresponding disposition of approximately  customers 
the average monthly service revenue rpu per pcs postpaid subscriber decreased to in  as compared to in this decrease is attributable primarily to changes in our rate plan offerings from to in  a substantial portion of our pcs subscribers were participants in a promotional plan under which they received unlimited monthly airtime for local calling for a fixed monthly fee of in  we offered multiple rate plans with fixed monthly access charges ranging from to these rate plans have contributed to an overall reduction in rpu per pcs postpaid subscriber as customers gravitate toward lower fixed rate plans  a trend consistent with a general trend in the wireless industry of declining rpu 
we anticipate some decline in our rpu per pcs postpaid subscriber in future periods due primarily to lower minute usage by new wireless subscribers and continued price competition among wireless carriers 
the rpu per cellular postpaid subscriber decreased to in from for this decrease reflects increased price competition among wireless carriers  which has prompted us to offer cellular rate plans with more bundled airtime minutes 
pcs roaming revenues including roaming long distance were million in  as compared to 
million in  which reflects the success of our roaming agreements with gsm alliance partners that became effective during the last few months of cellular roaming revenues increased million  or  in  as compared to this increase is due primarily to an increase in the number of roamers and the increased usage per roamer in we generated million in pcs prepaid service revenues in  as compared to in  which is attributable to the introduction of our intelligent network based prepaid service alternative in september rpu per pcs prepaid subscriber was since the launch of this service 
other service revenues  which include activation fees  fees from enhanced services  co location revenue and interconnection fees billed to local exchange carriers for connections to our pcs and cellular networks  increased million  or  for as compared to this increase is due primarily to our concentrated efforts to secure tenants for co location on our towers and the increase in interconnection fees as a result of increased traffic originating on the local exchange carriers networks and terminating on our pcs and cellular networks 
we waived all activation fees for new pcs subscribers in the third and fourth quarters of cost of services includes the cost of interconnection with local exchange carrier facilities  direct cell site costs eg  property taxes and insurance  site lease costs and electric utilities  pcs and cellular roaming validation provided by a third party clearinghouse  long distance toll costs and supplementary services such as voice mail 
pcs cost of services increased million  or  in as compared to this increase primarily reflects costs related to the approximately additional cell sites we placed in service in  as well as increased interconnection and toll costs related to increased traffic on our expanding pcs network 
cellular cost of services decreased million  or  in as compared to  primarily as a result of the sale of our cellular operations in the state of maine 
we generated a negative pcs equipment margin of on million of sales in  as compared to on million of sales in the increase in negative pcs equipment margin is primarily the result of special promotional prices that we offered on several handsets during the third and fourth quarters of we generated a negative cellular equipment margin of on 
million of sales in  as compared to on 
million of sales in this improvement in negative margin is attributable to a decrease in the cost of cellular handsets in we expect to continue subsidizing the cost of pcs and cellular handsets to consumers for the foreseeable future 
operations costs  which include the costs of managing and maintaining our cellular and pcs systems  customer service  credit and collections including bad debt and inventory management increased million  or  for as compared to pcs operations costs increased million  or  which is attributable to costs incurred to provide customer service to the growing pcs customer base  to maintain the expanding pcs network and to a significant increase in the bad debt provision resulting from the disconnection of non paying pcs customers 
cellular operations costs decreased 
million  or  which is attributable primarily to the sale of our cellular operations in the state of maine 
selling and marketing costs increased million  or  for as compared to pcs selling and marketing costs increased million  or  which is attributable to continued increases in pcs advertising and marketing costs and the expansion of our sales distribution channels  including increases in headcount  commissions and retail location costs 
cellular selling and marketing costs decreased million  or  which is attributable primarily to the sale of our cellular operations in the state of maine 
general and administrative costs increased million  or  for as compared to substantially all of this increase is attributable to pcs general and administrative costs  which increased due to increased headcount and the related facilities costs at our corporate and regional administrative offices and information technology center 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  for as compared to and consists principally of the depreciation of the pcs and cellular network and the amortization of pcs licenses 
substantially all of the increase is attributable to depreciation associated with the approximately additional pcs cell sites that we placed in service in and amortization associated with our launch of seven new pcs markets since the fourth quarter of net consolidated interest expense increased million  or  for as compared to this increase resulted primarily from interest expense incurred on our million senior notes due  lower funds available for investment due to the buildout of the pcs network and a reduction in capitalized interest million in compared to million in  which is attributable to the completion and placing in service of substantial portions of the pcs system 
the effective income tax rate for and was 
we generated a million net loss for and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in and beyond 
we will not recognize the tax benefit of these operating losses until management determines that it is more likely than not that such benefit is realizable 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following discussion reflects the results of operations for our pcs and cellular lines of business 
all general corporate costs have been allocated to those lines of business based on management s estimates of actual expenses incurred related to such lines of business 
postpaid service revenues increased million or for  as compared to pcs postpaid service revenues  which were million in  were the result of our continued subscriber growth 
our pcs subscribers grew from approximately  subscribers at december  from approximately  at december  cellular postpaid service revenues decreased million  or  primarily as a result of the sale of our cellular operations in the state of maine during the second quarter of and the corresponding reduction in  customers 
the rpu per local pcs subscriber was  which is substantially higher than cellular due mainly to the higher monthly access fees paid by the majority of our pcs subscribers for bundled airtime minutes and the long distance revenue generated by those subscribers 
the rpu per local cellular subscriber excluding roaming revenue and equipment sales decreased to in from for this decrease reflects lower usage patterns of new cellular customers  as well as price competition from competing wireless carriers 
we generated 
million in pcs roaming revenues under our roaming agreements with gsm alliance partners that became effective during the last five months of cellular roaming revenues including roamer long distance decreased million  or  in as compared to this decrease was attributable to the sale of our cellular operations in the state of maine  as well as our amended agreement with bellsouth cellular corp  operating as bellsouth mobility  effective january   under which we agreed to per minute reductions to the rates charged to bellsouth mobility for roaming incurred by its customers in our service territory 
other revenues  which include activation and installation fees  fees from optional features and interconnection fees billed to local exchange carriers for connections to our pcs network  increased million  or  for as compared to this increase was due to the activation fees associated with the addition of pcs subscribers noted above and interconnection fees  which previously had not been reciprocal between local exchange carriers and wireless carriers 
cost of services includes the cost of interconnection with local exchange carrier facilities  direct cell site costs  pcs and cellular roaming validation  long distance toll costs  cellular cloning and fraud and supplementary services

cellular cost of services decreased 
million  or  in as compared to this decrease was attributable to the sale of our cellular operations in the state of maine  but was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with cloning and subscription fraud during the first six months of the cost of cellular fraud was significantly reduced during the third and fourth quarters 
for our pcs operations  we generated a negative equipment margin of on million of sales in  as compared to on million of sales in the increase in negative pcs equipment margin was the result of our continued subsidization of the cost of pcs handsets 
we generated a negative cellular equipment margin of on 
million of sales in  as compared to a positive margin of on million of sales in this decrease in margin was due to our change in our method of accounting for certain promotional costs primarily equipment credits 
under the new method of accounting  we expense all cellular equipment subsidies as incurred 
in prior periods  we deferred and amortized those subsidies over the life of the related cellular contract 
operations costs  which include the costs of maintaining our cellular and pcs systems  customer service  credit and collections and inventory management totaled million for  which represented an increase of million  or  from pcs operations costs totaled million in  which represented a increase from and were comprised primarily of salaries and benefits  bad debt provisions  credit and collection costs and ongoing maintenance of existing sites 
cellular operations costs totaled million in  a decrease from  which is attributable primarily to the sale of our cellular operations in the state of maine 
selling and marketing costs totaled million for  an increase of million  or  from substantially all of this increase was attributable to pcs advertising costs  as well as the costs of all direct and indirect sales channels  including commissions incurred as a result of the continued rapid growth in the number of pcs subscribers

depreciation and amortization for totaled million  as compared to million for  and consists principally of the depreciation of the cellular and pcs network and the amortization of pcs licenses 
substantially all of the increase of million in depreciation and amortization for was due to depreciation of the pcs system and amortization of pcs licenses  substantial portions of which were first placed in service in late fourth quarter and continuing throughout net consolidated interest expense totaled million for  as compared to million of net consolidated interest income for the change in interest resulted primarily from interest expense incurred on our million senior notes issued june   lower funds available for investment due to the buildout of the pcs network and a reduction in capitalized interest million in compared to million in  which is attributable to the completion and placing in service of substantial portions of the pcs system 
the effective income tax rates for and were and tax benefit  respectively 
the tax benefit recognized in reflects the expected realization of certain net operating loss carrybacks 
we generated a million net loss for and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in and beyond 
we will not recognize the tax benefit of these operating losses until management determines that it is more likely than not that such benefit is realizable 
liquidity and capital resources we require significant amounts of capital for funding the operations and expansion of our pcs business 
total capital expenditures  including capital expenditures for information technology and the support of the pcs business  totaled approximately million for costs associated with the pcs system buildout include tower sites  leasehold improvements  base station and switch equipment and labor expenses related to construction of sites 
we currently estimate that capital expenditures will total approximately million in  primarily relating to the continued expansion of our pcs network to satisfy customer needs and competitive requirements  maintenance of our network service quality and billing system functionality and completion of customer service enhancement projects

in may  we sold our cellular operations in the state of maine to a subsidiary of rural cellular corporation 
on the closing date  rural cellular paid us million in cash and paid million into escrow 
on november   we received the million from escrow 
in addition  rural cellular reimbursed us for approximately  in capital expenditures made on its behalf prior to the closing of the transaction 
on march   we entered into a million credit agreement with ericsson inc regarding the purchase of and vendor financing for pcs equipment and services 
on october   march   june   and november   we and ericsson entered into amendments to the credit facility  which increased the equipment financing commitment to million and amended certain other provisions of the credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of  the million commitment under the credit facility was syndicated to a group of lenders 
on december   the credit facility was amended to increase the financing commitment to million 
on february   we and ericsson entered into an amended and restated credit facility to incorporate the terms and conditions of the original agreement and the subsequent amendments 
although we currently are unable to predict with certainty the amount of expenditures that may be made beyond  we expect that we will require additional capital 
sources of additional capital may include vendor financing  cash flow from operations  public and private equity and debt financing and asset dispositions 
we may also require additional financing in the event we decide to make acquisitions of additional licenses or businesses 
the extent of additional financing required will partially depend on the success of our businesses 
we currently have no other sources of income or cash flows other than our cellular and pcs operations and the interest income earned from investing our cash and the proceeds of the public and private debt and equity offerings and the sale of our cellular operations and certain assets 
we cannot guarantee that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that it can be obtained on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in our indentures  the credit facility or any future financing arrangements 
the restrictions on additional indebtedness under our indentures require us to satisfy specified leverage ratios in order to incur indebtedness  however  they permit us and our subsidiaries to incur an unlimited amount of additional indebtedness to finance the acquisition of inventory or equipment 
we expect to incur significant operating losses and to generate significant negative cash flow from operating activities in the future while we continue to develop and construct our pcs system and build a pcs customer base 
cash interest will not be payable on our senior discount notes prior to our management believes that cash flow from operations may be insufficient to repay the notes or any additional financing that we may obtain in full at maturity and that the notes may need to be refinanced 
we cannot guarantee that any such refinancing could be effected successfully or on terms acceptable to us 
during  we used net cash of million for operating activities  as compared to million for operating activities for consisted primarily of million of net loss and million of changes in operating assets and liabilities  which were partially offset by million of depreciation and amortization and million of bond accretion on the senior discount notes 
cash used in investing activities was million for  as compared to million for investing activities for consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling million and a decrease in accrued construction costs of million both primarily related to the buildout of the pcs system and support systems 
these activities were partially offset by funds from the liquidation of million of short term investments  which were used for the payment of interest related to the notes 
cash provided from financing activities was million for  as compared to million for financing activities for consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the sale of the series e preferred and series f preferred and borrowings of million under the credit facility 
recent accounting pronouncements effective in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
sfas had no impact on our financial statements as we have no comprehensive income elements 
effective in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  which requires us to report financial and descriptive information about our reportable operating segments 
sfas requires the reporting of a measure of segment profit or loss  certain specific revenue and expense items and segment assets  as well as a reconciliation of total segment revenues  total segment profit or loss  total segment assets and other amounts disclosed for segments to corresponding amounts in our general purpose financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and transactions involving hedge accounting 
we do not anticipate this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sop requires capitalization of certain costs of internal use software 
we adopted sop in january and do not anticipate this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
other the year issue is the result of potential problems with computer systems or any equipment with computer chips that use or store dates representing the year as just two digits eg  for 
on january   any clock or date recording mechanism  including date sensitive software  which uses only two digits to represent the year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar activities 
in  we established a year task force consisting of representatives from our network operations  information technology  finance and legal departments to address internal and external year issues 
the task force reports regularly to an executive level steering committee 
to assist the task force in its functions  we also engaged an outside consulting firm with expertise in year issues relating to the telecommunications industry 
with the support of this outside consulting firm  we completed phase of our year compliance program in december  which consisted of assessing internal hardware and software we use for year readiness as well as the state of readiness of outside third parties with whom we have significant relationships eg  vendors and suppliers 
our assessment of internal systems included our it systems as well as non it systems which systems contain embedded technology  such as network equipment  hvac systems and security systems containing microprocessors or other similar circuitry 
throughout phase  we also requested assurances from our major suppliers  including suppliers of network hardware and software and of pcs and cellular telephones  that they are addressing the year issue and that the suppliers products will function properly in the year in many cases  we are relying on such assurances that new and upgraded software and hardware will be year compliant 
during phase  we plan to test such third party products  but cannot be sure that our tests will be adequate or that  if problems are identified  they will be addressed by the supplier in a timely and satisfactory manner 
we also contacted pcs and cellular roaming partners and local exchange carriers that carry and terminate calls on our pcs and cellular networks to determine the extent to which their interfaces with our networks are vulnerable to year issues 
these actions are intended to help identify and mitigate the possible external impacts of the year problem 
however  it is impossible to fully assess the potential external consequences on our operations in the event service interruptions occur from suppliers  roaming partners  local exchange carriers and other third parties 
we may also be at risk if certain critical infrastructure services providers  such as electricity  water or telephone service providers  experience difficulties that result in disruption of service supplied to us 
phase of the year compliance program includes development of testing plans and remediation plans  as well as the implementation of those plans 
once phase is completed  we should be able to predict the potential impacts of year noncompliance with respect to our internal systems as well as external third parties with whom we have significant relationships eg  vendors and suppliers 
phase of the program is anticipated to be completed in mid we do not expect that the amount of remediation work required to address year problems will be extensive 
many of our financial and network systems have been implemented in the last few years  and our management believes that this newer equipment and software is generally year compliant 
however  we expect that we will be required to conduct limited year readiness testing and to continue to modify some of our existing hardware and software in order for our systems to function properly in the year and thereafter 
at this time  we have not calculated the total estimated cost of addressing year issues 
our management believes  however  that such cost will not be material and will be able to be funded through cash on hand 
to date  we have incurred and expensed only a nominal amount for phase and phase activities under our year plan  primarily for retainer of outside consultants and assessment activities under the plan 
we are optimistic that we will not experience a material disruption in our business as a result of year problems in our network operations  information processing or interfacing with local exchange carriers or roaming partners 
however  following phase of our year plan we will develop a contingency plan to provide for continuity of our business operations in the event of unforeseen internal and external year problems 
further  as the year project continues  we may discover additional year problems 
for example  we may not be able to develop  implement  or test remediation or contingency plans and may find that the costs of these activities exceed current expectations 
if we fail to satisfactorily resolve year issues related to our business in a timely manner  we could be exposed to liability from third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
