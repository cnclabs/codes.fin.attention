results of year ended december   as compared to year ended december  net sales consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of over sales gains were the result of the company s acquisition of usc europe in september and modest growth in domestic steel paint and oblong unit volumes 
the usc europe acquisition accounted for nearly of the total year to year increase 
aerosol net sales grew year to year to million  due to the usc europe acquisition 
paint  plastic general line sales of million increased versus prior year 
the increase was due largely to a full year of sales activity in plastic products that were acquired from cpi in the second quarter of some modest growth in metal paint and oblong containers also bolstered year to year comparisons in this segment

aerosol gross income declined to million versus the prior year

competitive pricing pressure in the domestic aerosol market eroded gross margins  as the company had little success in passing through steel cost increases to its customers 
paint  plastic general line gross income of million was better than due to a full year of plastic sales volume 
competitive pricing pressure on metal paint cans also compressed margins in this segment 
custom specialty gross income of million in fell  largely due to unprofitable popcorn tin business

environmental matters the processes involved in the lithography and certain aspects of the manufacture of steel containers have historically involved the use and handling of materials now classified as hazardous substances under various laws 
these activities may expose owners and operators of the facilities involved to potential liability for the cost to clean up or remedy any environmental contamination resulting from such substances 
it is possible that the company s insurance coverage may extend to certain environmental liabilities  but the company has not been able to estimate such coverage due to the complexity and uncertainty inherent in such an estimate 
the company has not considered insurance coverage in assessing its potential liabilities 
in addition  the company has obtained indemnities against certain liabilities in connection with its recent acquisitions 
management does not believe that remediation costs  if any  in excess of the reserve established  will have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
a variety of propellants are used in the company s principal product  aerosol cans 
these propellants include hydrocarbons  compressed gases for example  carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide  and volatile organic compounds such as propane  butane and isobutane collectively vocs 
some united states and european regulations concerning vocs have caused consumer product manufacturers the company s customers to reformulate either their products  the propellants used therein or both 
to date  most of the company s customers have been successful in reformulating both their products and propellants 
however  there can be no assurance that all customers will be able to effect such reformulations or future reformulations  if any  in either products or propellants with satisfactory results 
if customers are unable to do so  this could have an adverse effect on the market for aerosol cans 
as a potentially responsible party prp at various superfund sites in the us  the company is or may be legally responsible  jointly and severally with the other members of the prp group  for the cost of remediation of these sites 
based on currently available data including epa data  internal records and other sources believed to be reliable  the company believes its contribution  and or the contribution of its predecessors  to these sites was in most cases de minimis 
based on the information available as of the date of this report  management does not believe that its aggregate remediation costs or potential liabilities in connection with these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the other prp s will pay their proportionate share of the remediation costs at these sites and  as a result  future costs or liabilities incurred by the company could be significantly increased

inflation tin plated steel represents the primary component of the company s raw materials requirement 
historically  the company has not always been able to immediately offset increases in tin plate prices with price increases on the company s products 
however  in most years  a combination of factors has permitted the company to maintain its profitability notwithstanding these conditions 
the company s capital spending programs and manufacturing process upgrades have increased operating efficiencies and thereby mitigated the impact of inflation on the company s cost structure 
customer relationships aerosol containers aerosol containers accounted for of the company s total net sales for the year ended december  a significant reduction in the number of aerosol containers used by the company s customers could have a material adverse effect on the company and  in particular  its european operations which are comprised solely of aerosol manufacturing facilities 
in october  us can received written confirmation of a major customer s intention to purchase certain annual unit volumes of aerosol cans from us can  including usc europe operations 
the company s manufacturing facility in merthyr tydfil  in which the company has invested approximately million  was opened in large part due to the major customer s decision 
the loss of this customer or a material reduction in the benefits to the company expected under this arrangement  would have an adverse impact on the profitability of that facility and the company s ability to recoup its investment in merthyr tydfil 
it is not us can s policy to have any plant devoted exclusively to one customer and the plant has begun to service other customers in the company s relationships with its customers are critical to its business 
a significant portion of the company s annual net sales is attributable to repeat customers 
the loss of a significant number of such customers could have a material effect on the company 
year the year issue is the result of certain computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
such computer programs will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
the year issue presents several risks to the company  such as i the company s internal systems may not function properly  ii suppliers or customers computer and operational systems may not function properly  causing delays in delivery of materials and supplies  and delays in orders and payments to the company for delivered product  and iii the company s banks computer systems could malfunction  disrupting orderly deposits  fund transfers  and payments 
the company is a manufacturer of consumer  commercial and specialty packaging products 
the products produced and sold by the company are unaffected by year issues since they contain no microprocessors or similar electronic components 
the company has been in the process of evaluating its internal computing infrastructure  business applications and manufacturing systems for year compliance 
the company s main operating systems hardware and operational software  including all hardware and software associated with its internal network  is already year compliant 
all facilities with the exception of those announced to be sold in are currently using a system for their order entry  accounts receivable  customer invoicing  and various other critical business functions  for which a compliant system is available from the system vendor 
the compliant version will be rolled out in the first quarter of a compliant version of the general ledger is installed and conversion and related testing are expected in the second quarter of the company is working with its current payroll service provider to convert its existing payroll and human resource systems to a year compliant integrated solution 
this conversion and related testing will be completed in the third quarter of all personal computers are in the process of converting to a year compliant operating system 
shop floor data collection and inventory management systems are being upgraded for year compliance 
in addition to these activities  the company has inventoried its manufacturing facilities to further identify any systems or equipment that might have compliance issues  and is working to make the systems compliant 
key vendors have been contacted by the company to ensure uninterrupted supply of materials and services critical to core operations 
none of the suppliers contacted have indicated any compliance issues to date 
their efforts in regards to year compliance will be followed closely by the company throughout as part of its normal course of business  the company has evaluated and invested in its internal computer systems as a means to streamline processes and better manage its operations 
many system conversions were already in process yielding year compliance as a side benefit 
as such  it is difficult to separate the cost of year compliance from ongoing information system costs already recorded in the financial results of the company as part of its normal operations 
however  the company estimates that year compliance costs have been less than million in total to date 
all such costs and any future costs estimated at less than million have been or will be funded through cash generated from operations 
the company will identify and evaluate potential business disruption scenarios surrounding the year issue 
such plans may include securing alternative sources of supply  increasing safety stock of materials  adjusting facility shutdown and start up schedules and other appropriate measures 
these plans and related cost estimates will be refined as additional information becomes available 
management believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected in a timely manner  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations 
nor can there be assurances that there will be no adverse impact on its relationships with customers  vendors  or others 
any failure to become year compliant by banks  vendors  customers  and governmental agencies may have an impact on the results of the company to the extent they relate to the company s ongoing operations and business requirements 
other items acquisitions acquisitions have been a key part of the company s growth strategy 
for further details on past acquisitions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s business as a whole has minor seasonal variations  whereby quarterly sales and earnings tend to be slightly stronger starting in early spring second quarter and extending through late summer third quarter 
aerosol sales do not tend to fluctuate during the year  with only relatively minor spring and summer increases related to household products and insect repellents 
paint container sales tend to be stronger in spring and early summer due to the favorable weather conditions 
portions of the custom and specialty products line tend to vary seasonally  because of holiday sales late in the year 
legal the company is involved in various legal proceedings including a labor matter involving a closed facility 
the company believes it is adequately reserved for these matters

the company expects to spend approximately to million on capital expenditures during the five years commencing in  in an amount of approximately to million in and in roughly equal amounts of approximately to million in each year thereafter 
the company s capital investments are expected to yield reduced operating costs  thereby improving profit margins 
capital investments are evaluated under a shareholder value added sva approach 
this approach seeks incremental net operating profit after tax which covers the weighted average cost of capital estimated at of the investment 
management believes that cash flow from operations and amounts available under its credit facilities should provide sufficient funds for the company s short term and long term capital expenditure and debt amortization requirements  and other cash needs in the ordinary course of business 
if future strategic acquisition opportunities arise  the company would expect to finance them though some combination of cash  stock and or debt financing
