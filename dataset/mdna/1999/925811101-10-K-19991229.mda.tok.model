year the company s software based products have been tested for year compliance and the company believes that such products are year compatible 
with respect to its own computer operating systems  the company has completed the upgrade of its principal operating computer software to the most recent available revisions sold by its software suppliers  which the suppliers have represented to be year compliant 
the company believes that such upgrades will solve those year problems that could affect its operating software 
the costs for such upgrades were not material 
it is possible that certain computer systems or software products of the company s customers or suppliers may experience year problems and that such problems could adversely affect the company 
the company continues to assess the status of its principal suppliers year readiness and their plans to address problems that their computer systems may face in correctly processing date information as the year approaches 
however  since the ultimate success of the company s customers and suppliers to become compliant is largely outside of the company s control  no assurances can be made that the company will be unaffected by the year should the company s suppliers fail to achieve year compliance  the supply of product to the company may be interrupted resulting in possible lost revenue to the company due to its inability to supply finished product to its customers 
if such interruptions are prolonged  the company will seek alternative suppliers 
however  delays may occur which could have a material adverse effect on the company

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity 
this statement establishes comprehensive accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 deferring the required implementation of sfas no 
this sfas will be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal implementation of this statement is not expected to affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency activity the company s foreign exchange exposure is principally limited to the relationship of the us dollar to the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
japanese sourced products denominated in japanese yen accounted for approximately and of product purchases in fiscal and  respectively 
in  the us dollar had significantly weakened in relation to the yen  resulting in increased costs for such products 
the company attempts to minimize its currency exposure on these purchases through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
the company also attempts to reduce the impact of an unfavorable exchange rate condition through cost reductions from its suppliers  lowering production cost through product redesign  and shifting product sourcing to suppliers transacting in more stable and favorable currencies 
sales by the company s uk based subsidiary to customers in europe are made in pounds sterling and euros 
in fiscal  approximately million of products were sold by the company to its uk based subsidiary for resale 
the us dollar was relatively stable against the pound sterling in in years when the pound weakened significantly against the us dollar  the cost of us sourced product sold by this subsidiary increased 
the company attempts to minimize its currency exposure on intercompany sales through the purchase of forward exchange contracts 
in general  the company seeks lower costs from suppliers and enters into forward exchange contracts to mitigate exchange rate exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective in limiting foreign currency exposure 
market risk factors the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company has a policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow see foreign currency activity and note derivative instruments and fair value of financial instruments to the accompanying financial statements 
at september   the company s foreign currency exchange risks included a million intercompany accounts receivable balance due from the company s uk based subsidiary and a  japanese yen denominated trade accounts payable liability due to inventory suppliers 
such assets and liabilities are short term and will be settled in fiscal the following sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at september   a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound would result in a  decrease or increase  respectively  in the intercompany accounts receivable balance 
such foreign currency exchange risk at september  has been substantially hedged by forward exchange contracts 
a strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen would result in a  decrease in the trade accounts payable liability  while a weakening of the dollar would result in a  increase in such liability 
at september   the company had million of outstanding floating rate bank debt and corresponding interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert the foregoing floating rate debt to stated fixed rates see note long term debt to the accompanying financial statements 
thus  the company has substantially no net interest rate exposures on these instruments 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company has lessened in recent years as the rate of inflation remains low 
however  inflation continues to increase costs to the company 
as operating expenses and production costs increase  the company seeks price increases to its customers to the extent permitted by market conditions
