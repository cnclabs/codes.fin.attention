item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the results of operations of first financial corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiary  first bank and trust company collectively  company  depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest earning assets and interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
its interest earning assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities  while its interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal home loan bank advances and the senior debenture 
the company s net income is also affected by its level of noninterest income  including fees and service charges  as well as by its noninterest expenses  such as salary and employee benefits  provisions to the allowance for loan losses  occupancy costs and  when necessary  expenses related to other real estate owned oreo and to the administration of nonperforming and other classified assets 
the company reported net income for of  as compared to  for  or an increase of 
diluted earnings per share amounted to per share for  based on  weighted average shares outstanding  as compared to per share for  also based on  weighted average shares outstanding 
also  in  the company s return on average equity roe improved to from in the company s return on average assets roa was in and the improvement in net income is primarily the result of an increase in net interest income and noninterest income  offset somewhat by an increase in noninterest expense and provision for income taxes 
in general  the company s improvement in earnings is attributable to i an increase in average interest earning assets funded from both retail and wholesale sources  ii an increase in sba lending activities  and iii strong asset quality 
results of operations net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the single largest contributor to the company s results of operations 
in  net interest income rose  or  to  from  in the primary reason for this increase was due to an increase in average interest earning assets of million  or offset somewhat by a basis point decrease in average net interest spread to in  as compared to in the increase in average interest earning assets was funded largely from deposit growth and other borrowings 
increases in average stockholders equity and an increase in average noninterest bearing deposits  accounted for a decrease in average net interest margin of basis points to in  the same as the basis point decrease in net interest spread 
in total interest income amounted to  compared to  in  or an increase of  or 
this increase was attributable to an million increase in average interest earning assets  offset somewhat by a basis points decline in earning asset yields 
the increase in earning assets was funded by an increase of million in retail deposits and a million increase in wholesale sources 
within earning assets  average loans increased million or  while average investments increased million 
during  average loans represented of total average interest earning assets  compared to during this disproportionate growth from higher yielding loans to lower yielding investments  along with a lower interest rate environment  accounted for the decline in average interest earning asset yield to from 
in terms of rate volume  the decline in rates reduced interest income by approximately  but the increase in volume contributed approximately  in interest income 
total interest expense amounted to  in compared to  in  or an increase of  or 
average interest bearing deposits grew million  while cost of funds on interest bearing deposits remained flat at 
despite a declining interest rate environment  the company s cost of funds on retail deposits remained flat due to the predominent growth of retail deposits in high costing time certificates of deposit 
the cost of funds on time deposits dropped to from 
average wholesale funds reverse repurchase agreements  fhlb advances  etc 
increased million while its cost decreased to from 
the overall cost on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in compared to in in terms of rate volume  the decline in rates helped reduce interest expense by approximately  while the increase in total interest bearing liabilities of million caused an increase of approximately  in interest expense 
overall  as a result of changes in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as a declining interest rate environment  net interest income decreased approximately  however  due to balance sheet growth volume net interest income increased  this rate volume activity produced an increase of  to net interest income

as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
financial condition total assets the company s total assets increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the increase in total assets primarily occurred within the company s loan portfolio which increased million 
the remainder of the increase took place within investment securities which increased million 
the primary funding sources for the rise in total assets were i million increase in total deposits  ii nearly million in net income  less dividends paid  iii million increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and iv million increase in federal home loan bank advances 
investment securities the company s total investment securities portfolio increased million to million at december   from million at december  at december   securities which were classified as held to maturity were carried at an amortized cost of  with a fair value of  securities classified as available for sale were carried at a fair value of  with an amortized cost of  at december   government agency debt securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were classified as held to maturity which is consistent with the company s intent and ability 
the available for sale segment of investment securities was comprised of us treasury securities  government agency discount notes  mortgage backed securities  and marketable equity securities 
the securities in which the company may invest are subject to regulation and  for the most part  are limited to securities which are considered investment grade securities 
in addition  the company has an internal investment policy which restricts investments to i united states treasury securities  ii obligations of united states government agencies and corporations  iii collateralized mortgage obligations  including securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma  the government national mortgage association gnma  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  iv securities of states and political subdivisions  v corporate debt  all of which must be considered investment grade by a recognized rating service  and vi corporate stock 
in addition to achieving a rate of return which is consistent with the overall risk profile of the investment portfolio  the company views the principal purpose of its investment securities as a ready source of liquidity and as a management tool against interest rate risk embedded within the company s balance sheet 
generally  the company invests in fixed rate government and agency obligations with a maturity not to exceed three years 
single index floating rate or step up securities generally have final maturities which do not exceed five years at time of purchase 
consequently  the company s exposure to significant market swings is somewhat controlled 
at december   the company s investment securities had net unrealized gains of  as compared to net unrealized gains of  at december  loans total loans  net of unearned discount  amounted to million at december   up million  or  from million at the end of the increase in total loans was predominately in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolio  which grew million  while residential real estate  home equity lines of credit and consumer loans declined million

   residential real estate    home equity lines of credit    consumer    unearned discount allowance for loan losses    net loans    in  the company encountered solid loan demand from small businesses 
the company believes a primary reason for this demand was the desire of small business borrowers to seek banking relationships with banks which were responsive to their needs  and the success of the company in meeting those needs 
the increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans reflected the company s emphasis on i small business lending  ii obtaining loan guarantees from the sba  and iii cash flow analysis and an overall assessment of the borrower s financial strength and ability to repay with a secondary view towards collateral values 
the bank offers a full range of consumer lending products including residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit  new and used automobile loans  passbook and certificate of deposit loans  and other personal secured and unsecured loans 
although the bank makes an effort to price these loans competitively  it faces substantial competition from mortgage and consumer finance companies 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and other real estate owned oreo 
the nonperforming loans category includes loans on which the accrual of interest is discontinued when the collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  or when payments of principal or interest have become days past due and have arrearages that have not been eliminated 
in certain instances  nonperforming loans may also include loans that have become days past due but remain on accrual status because the value of the collateral securing the loan is sufficient to cover principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection 
oreo consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings 
in addition to the preceding two categories  the company may  under appropriate circumstances  restructure loans as a concession to a borrower 
at december   and  no troubled debt restructurings were included in the company s loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth information regarding nonperforming assets and delinquent loans days past due as to interest or principal  and held by the company at the dates indicated 
the amounts and ratios shown are exclusive of the loans and allowance for loan losses acquired in the chariho exeter credit union acquisition 
december  dollars in thousands loans past due days or more but not included in nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets  delinquent loans days past due nonperforming loans as a percent of gross loans 
nm nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets delinquent loans days past due as a percent of gross loans allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions charged against income 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge offs in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
among the factors are i the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio generally  ii the quality of specific loans  iii the level of non accruing loans  iv current economic conditions  v trends in delinquencies and prior charge offs  and vi the value of the underlying collateral 
ultimate loan losses may vary significantly from current estimates 
the company reviews nonperforming and performing loans to ascertain whether any impairment exists within the loan portfolio 
the company evaluates these problem loans and estimates the potential loss exposure when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
because the allowance for loan losses is based on various estimates and includes a high degree of judgment  subsequent changes in general economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may require changes in those estimates 
the bank has an informal loan peer review function and a loan loss review committee 
the loan peer review committee  which meets monthly  is an informal committee comprised of the bank s chief executive officer and other loan officers 
every loan of  or more or a total relationship of  or more is scheduled to be reviewed annually by the loan peer review committee 
all loans that undergo loan peer review receive a numerical grade ranging from to based on a number of criteria  including the financial strength of the borrower as determined  in part  by such borrower s liquidity  debt service coverage and historical performance 
any loan rated or worse will automatically be placed on a watchlist 
certain rated loans for which the committee has identified potential problems may also be placed on the watchlist 
the loans on the watchlist are reviewed monthly by the bank s credit committee in order to determine what actions should be taken with respect to such loans  whether any loans should be added or deleted from the watchlist  and to make estimates regarding loan loss exposure to the loan loss review committee 
the loan loss review committee  comprised of the bank s chief executive officer  chief financial officer and all other loan officers  reviews loans on the watchlist on a quarterly basis in order to establish specific loan loss reserve levels 
in addition to assessing loss exposure for all loans included on the watchlist  the loan loss review committee also applies a three year moving weighted average  by category  of net charge offs to each loan type exclusive of watchlist loans which are specifically reviewed 
finally  the loan loss review committee will take into consideration the above mentioned conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in determining the historical charge off and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss regarding these conditions involves a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem loans or loan portfolio types 
the following table is an analysis of the allowance for loan losses over the last three years 
this table excludes the acquired loans and related allowance

total deposits increased million  or  to million at december   from million at the end of total demand deposits increased million  while savings and money market accounts decreased million 
the preponderance of deposit growth occurred within time deposits which increased million 
of this increase  one month to twenty four month time deposits grew million while the company s eighteen and thirty six month variable rate certificates of deposit decreased million 
the company s depositors  concerned that interest rates would decline in the near term  shifted their deposits from the longer term variable deposit product to the shorter term fixed rate deposit product 
along with its deposit gathering efforts  the company relied on borrowing from securities sold under agreements to repurchase reverse repo to leverage its capital 
at december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase amounted to million  compared to million at december during  the bank expanded its use of wholesale funding sources and took down advances for the first time from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb 
the purpose of these borrowings was to match the funding for selected loans as well as refinance a maturing reverse repo at more favorable terms 
at december   advances from the fhlb amounted to million 
asset liability management the principal objective of the company s asset and liability management is to minimize interest rate risk on net interest income and stockholders equity 
this objective is accomplished by managing the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or repricing dates 
the company s actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee which includes members of the company s senior management and two members of the company s board of directors 
the asset liability management committee is actively involved in formulating the economic assumptions that the company uses in its financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor the company s sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities is analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates  a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
the company has historically sought to maintain a relatively narrow gap position and has  in some instances  foregone investment in higher yielding assets where such investment  in management s opinion  exposed the company to undue interest rate risk 
however  the company does not attempt to perfectly match interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and will selectively mismatch its assets and liabilities to a controlled degree where it considers it both appropriate and prudent to do so 
in managing its interest rate risk exposure  the company does not engage in derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
other than fixed rate loan commitments  the company is prohibited  by internal policy  from engaging in the use of off balance sheet financial instruments 
there are a number of relevant time periods in which to measure the company s gap position  such as at the three  six  and twelve month points and beyond in the maturity schedule 
management tends to focus most closely on the gap up to the one year point in making its principal funding and investing decisions 
the following table presents the repricing schedule for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  within over three over one over five three to twelve year to years to over ten months months five years ten years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities purchased under agreements to resell  and other   investment securities

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
by using simulation modeling techniques  the company is able to measure its interest rate risk exposure as determined by the impact of sudden movements in interest rates on net interest income and equity 
this exposure is termed earnings at risk and equity at risk 
at december   the company s earnings at risk under a basis point interest rate shock test measured a negative in a worst case scenario 
under a similar test  the company s equity at risk measured a negative of market value of equity at december  at december   the company s earnings at risk and equity at risk fell well within tolerance levels established by internal policy 
liquidity liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to earning enhancement opportunities in a changing marketplace 
primary sources of liquidity consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  securities sold under agreement to repurchase  fhlb advances  maturity of investment securities and sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
these sources fund the bank s lending and investment activities 
at december   cash and due from banks  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and short term investments unpledged and maturing within one year amounted to million  or of total assets 
management is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies and tactics to meet these targets 
through membership in the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb  the company has access to both short and long term borrowings of nearly million  which could assist the company in meeting its liquidity needs and funding its asset mix 
at december   the company held state and municipal demand deposits of million which it considered highly volatile 
nonetheless  the company believes that there are no adverse trends in the company s liquidity or capital reserves  and the company believes that it maintains adequate liquidity to meet its commitments 
the company is cognizant of the special liquidity demands posed by the year issue 
liquidity plans are being developed to ensure adequate liquidity on hand and available should abnormal demands result from the year issue 
refer to the discussion below regarding year compliance 
capital resources total stockholders equity of the company at december  was million  as compared to million at december  the increase of million primarily resulted from million in net income  less dividends declared 
the bank is subject to the leverage and risk based capital ratio requirements of the fdic 
the bank is deemed to be well capitalized by the fdic and is classified as such for fdic insurance assessment purposes 
at december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  as compared to at december  the fdic s minimum leverage capital ratio for adequately capitalized financial institutions is  although this minimum leverage ratio applies only to certain of the most highly rated banks 
other institutions are subject to higher requirements 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
according to these standards  the bank had a tier i risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of at december   as compared to a tier i risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of at december  the minimum risk based tier i and total capital ratios at each of these dates were and  respectively 
the capital structure of the company is subject to the capital ratio requirements of the federal reserve bank  which happens to be the same requirements which fdic imposes on the bank 
at december   the company s leverage capital ratio was  as compared to at december  the company s tier i risk based capital ratio was and its total risk based capital ratio was at december   and and  respectively  at december  year compliance the efficient operation of the company s business is highly dependent on its computer software programs and operating systems 
virtually all of these programs and systems are furnished  supported and maintained by correspondent institutions  computer service and system providers  and software vendors 
as the year approaches  a critical business issue has emerged regarding how existing application software programs and operating systems can accommodate this date value 
as a result  the year could be the maximum date value these systems will be able to accurately process 
the company has adopted a year plan which calls for completion of a risk assessment  identification  reprogramming and testing of all programs and systems no later than march  the company has completed the risk assessment and identification phase of the year plan and is now in the reprogramming and testing phase 
the plan also requires all programs and systems to be fully tested and year compliant by june  the company s board of directors plays a very active role in the year compliance effort 
the board has approved the year plan and receives monthly status reports from members of the project team 
the fdic has also played a very active role and has visited the company on two occasions to examine the company s progress 
in confronting the year problem  the company faces potential risks to its and the bank s operations 
as stated above  the company purchases substantially all of its software from third parties who face the same year challenge as the company 
in addition  the company relies almost exclusively on other companies for the functioning of its automated system 
thus  the company s operations could be adversely affected if the operations of these third parties are adversely affected by the year problem 
most importantly  the company faces risks that all banking institutions  whether large or small  also face 
included among these risks is the risk that the year date change may result in the inability to process and underwrite loan applications  to credit deposits and withdrawals from customer accounts  to credit loan payments or track delinquencies  to properly reconcile and record daily activity or to engage in similar normal banking activities 
additionally  if those commercial loan customers of the bank whose operations depend heavily on computers and computer software experience year compliance problems and suffer adverse effects with respect to their own operations  their ability to meet their obligations to the bank could be adversely affected 
this could force the bank to increase its provision for loan losses or take more aggressive collection actions  potentially impacting the company s earnings 
furthermore  the bank faces the risk that in light of potential uncertainty as to the availability of their funds after the date change and a decrease in interest rates  the bank s deposit customers could withdraw their funds  causing the bank to experience deposit run off prior to the year date change 
this potential deposit contraction could make it necessary for the company to change its sources of funding which could materially affect the company s earnings 
moreover  to the extent that the risks posed by the year problem are pervasive in data processing and transmission and communications services worldwide  the company cannot predict with any certainty that its operations will remain materially unaffected after january   or on dates preceding this date at which time post january  dates become significant within the bank s systems 
finally  to the extent that certain utility and communication services utilized by the company face year problems  the company s operations could be disrupted 
the company is in constant communication with its outside vendors  with whom it is reliant  to ensure that their timetable and progress is consistent with that of the company 
the company has also communicated with significant borrowers and mission critical vendors to determine the status of their year compliance efforts 
the company has also kept the bank s depositors informed of its efforts 
the company has incorporated a contingency plan into the year plan 
the contingency plan calls for a conversion to another core system provider in the event of a system failure during the remediation effort 
if the failure occurs on or after january   the company will convert to a manual system until the computerized system is remedied 
the company believes that a major system failure is highly unlikely  but limited exceptions across its core applications may occur 
the company does not anticipate that the remedial or systems failure costs incurred in connection with year compliance will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the discussion above contains certain forward looking statements 
the costs of the year conversion  the date which the company has set to complete its year project and statements about anticipated compliance are based on the company s current estimates and are subject to various uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
such uncertainties include  among others  the success of the company in identifying systems that are not year compliant  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected systems  the availability of qualified personnel  consultants and other resources  and the success of the year compliance efforts of others 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
comparison of with the company reported net income for of  as compared to  for  or an increase of 
diluted earnings per share amounted to per share for  based on  weighted average shares outstanding  as compared to 
per share for  based on  weighted average shares outstanding 
the improvement in net income is primarily the result of an increase in net interest income and a reduction in the provision for possible loan losses  which were offset somewhat by a decrease in noninterest income  and an increase in noninterest expense and provision for income taxes 
in general  the company s improvement in earnings is attributable to its ability to i increase average interest earning assets funded from the net proceeds of the public offering  along with deposits and other borrowings  ii increase loan originations  and iii improved asset quality 
net interest income in  net interest income rose  or to  from  in the primary reason for this increase was due to an increase in average interest earning assets of million  or  offset somewhat by a basis point decrease in average net interest spread to in  as compared to in the increase in average interest earning assets was funded largely from the net proceeds of the public offering  deposit growth and other borrowings 
increases in average stockholders equity and an increase in average noninterest bearing deposits  accounted for a decrease in average net interest margin of only basis points to in as compared to the basis point decrease in net interest spread 
interest income totaled  in  an increase of  or over the prior year 
the million increase in average interest earning assets was primarily responsible for the improvement in interest income 
during  loan demand was solid 
nonetheless  the composition of loans to average interest earning assets decreased to during  from during this decrease was primarily the result of the purchase of nearly million in mortgage backed securities in the latter part of these securities which were placed in the company s available for sale investment portfolio  produced yields which were lower than the blended yield on average interest earning assets 
consequently  despite a relatively stable interest rate environment  the slight change in the mix of average interest earning assets accounted for a basis point reduction in average earning asset yield to in from in interest expense amounted to  in  an increase of  or over the  reported in this increase was largely attributable to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities and a basis point increase in cost of funds to during  from during of the increase in average interest bearing liabilities  average time deposits increased million and average securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million 
lower cost now  savings and money market deposits decreased million 
the increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase was used to fund the purchase of the mortgage backed securities 
despite the gathering of new deposits and the shifting of existing deposits into higher cost time deposits  the company s cost of funds would have remained flat at in both and were it not for the increase in volume and rate of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  in  compared to  in the  reduction in the provision for loan losses was strictly a function of asset quality 
as compared to year end  the company s watch list loans decreased to million from million  impaired loans decreased to million from million  and impaired loans requiring a specific reserve decreased to
