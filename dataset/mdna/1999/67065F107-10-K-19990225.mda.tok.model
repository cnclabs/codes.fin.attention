item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
at year end  nvest completed a restructuring the restructuring that included the transfer of its business  assets and liabilities to the operating partnership 
as a result of the restructuring  nvest s sole asset consists of its economic interest in the operating partnership 
nvest records its investment in the operating partnership under the equity method of accounting based on its proportionate share of net income of the operating partnership 
at december   nvest owned approximately million units  or approximately of the economic interests in the operating partnership 
as part of the restructuring  nvest elected to retain its partnership tax status in return for paying an annual federal gross income tax on its proportionate share of the gross income of the operating partnership 
for further information regarding the restructuring  please refer to the discussion under item  business restructuring of the partnership 
as a result of the restructuring  management s discussion and analysis includes two sections 
in the first section  the results of nvest for the year ended december  are compared to pro forma results for the year ended december  the pro forma results for assume the restructuring had occurred on january   to show comparative results under the equity method of accounting 
in the second section  the results of the operating partnership for the year ended december  are compared to the results of nvest for the year ended december   because the operations of the operating partnership prior to the restructuring were those of nvest 
a discussion of the results of nvest for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is not considered meaningful due to the accounting changes brought on by the restructuring equity method of accounting as compared to consolidated operating results and therefore has not been included 
nvest  lp nvest summary financial information of nvest for the years ended december  and follows pro forma actual in thousands  except per unit data equity in earnings of the operating partnership   gross income tax and other expenses  net   net income   net income per unit diluted regular distributions declared per unit pro forma financial information for the year ended december  is presented to provide a basis of comparison to the results of nvest for the year ended december   and gives effect to the restructuring as if it occurred on january  pro forma financial information includes nvest s equity in earnings of the operating partnership as if it had been formed on january  and the federal gross income tax was in effect 
the pro forma financial information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have been obtained had the restructuring occurred on the assumed date  nor is the pro forma financial information necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for any future period 
general nvest derives its net income and cash available for distribution from its ownership of approximately million units in the operating partnership representing an approximate interest 
each quarter nvest distributes to its unitholders substantially all of the distributions received from the operating partnership after meeting its federal and state tax obligations along with some miscellaneous operating expenses see operating partnership distribution policy  below 
nvest s major expense is the federal gross income tax that is payable on nvest s proportionate share of the operating partnership s gross income 
distributions to unitholders in nvest received distributions from the operating partnership totaling per unit 
nvest in turn declared distributions of  with the difference consisting primarily of the tax obligations discussed above 
changes in operating cash flow per unit at the operating partnership will directly impact the amount of future distributions at nvest 
statement of income for compared to pro forma net income of nvest of million or per unit diluted for increased million or per unit diluted from pro forma net income of million or per unit diluted for the increase reflects higher equity in earnings of the operating partnership  partially offset by a proportionate increase in gross income tax and other expenses 
the operating partnership has significant non cash expenses which allow it  and therefore nvest  to maintain a distribution level in excess of net income 
equity in earnings of the operating partnership of million for increased million from pro forma equity in earnings of million for the increase reflects the higher net income of the operating partnership as nvest s revenue is primarily derived from its equity interest in the operating partnership 
a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the operating partnership follows 
gross income tax and other expenses of million for increased million from pro forma million for gross income tax and other expenses include a tax on nvest s proportionate share of the gross income of the operating partnership  as well as other miscellaneous expenses 
capital resources and liquidity on december   nvest had a distribution receivable from the operating partnership of million representing the per unit fourth quarter distribution declared by the operating partnership on december  and payable on february  at december   nvest owned  units or approximately of the operating partnership 
for the fourth quarter of  nvest declared a quarterly distribution of per unit payable to nvest unitholders on february  the differential between the distribution receivable from the operating partnership and the distribution declared by nvest consists primarily of nvest s tax obligations discussed above 
the gross income tax is payable on or before march  effective for tax years ended after  the gross income tax is required to be paid in quarterly installments 
to the extent there are temporary cash shortfalls due to the timing of tax payments and the receipt of quarterly distributions  short term loans will be extended to nvest by the operating partnership 
the operating partnership the following is an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the operating partnership for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and the operations of the operating partnership prior to the restructuring were conducted by nvest  lp  and subsequent to the restructuring  by nvest companies  lp nvest nvest  nvest  companies  lp lp lp in thousands  except per unit data revenues    expenses restricted unit plan compensation    amortization of intangibles    other expenses    net income    operating cash flow    operating cash flow per unit diluted distributions declared per unit regular special total weighted average units outstanding diluted    operating cash flow is defined as net income adjusted for amortization of intangibles  restricted unit plan compensation and non recurring items

operating cash flow  as calculated above  may not be consistent with comparable computations by other companies 
general the operating partnership is an investment management firm with approximately billion in assets under management at december  it operates through eleven investment management firms and six principal distribution and consulting firms to provide a wide array of investment styles and products to institutional  mutual fund and private client markets 
the operating partnership s assets under management include equity securities  fixed income securities  money market funds and real estate 
the operating partnership seeks to grow by expanding the investment management firms capabilities  selectively pursuing the acquisition of investment management firms  increasing and focusing its marketing efforts  and selectively expanding its distribution channels 
the operating partnership supports the firms existing businesses and new initiatives that demonstrate substantial potential for growth in assets under management by allocating capital and other resources to those businesses and initiatives 
in addition  the operating partnership and the investment management firms identify opportunities for joint marketing efforts  enhanced distribution of investment products such as mutual funds and operational efficiencies across the organization 
the operating partnership s revenues derive primarily from management and advisory fees earned from services provided by the investment management firms 
for institutional and private clients  fees are generally billed quarterly and are calculated as a percentage of actual assets under management at the beginning or end of the calendar quarter 
for mutual fund clients  fees are billed monthly and are calculated as a percentage of the fund s average daily net assets 
any change in assets under management  which can result from market action  net client inflows or outflows  and acquisitions  has a major impact on revenues earned by the operating partnership 
the operating partnership can earn additional management and advisory fee revenues as a result of performance fees and transaction fees 
such fees are generally earned at the end of the performance contract period or upon completion of specific transactions  sometimes resulting in periodic fluctuations of such revenues 
in addition to management and advisory fees  the operating partnership earns other revenues related to services provided to mutual funds and other clients  distribution fees and sales fees 
distribution policy the operating partnership generally distributes to its unitholders operating cash flow not required for normal business operations and working capital needs  including support of its growth strategy and the repurchase of units 
operating cash flow is defined as net income adjusted for amortization of intangibles  restricted unit plan compensation and non recurring items 
in  the operating partnership declared distributions of per unit  compared to per unit in regular distributions declared in the operating partnership paid out approximately percent of its operating cash flow in distributions during assets under management assets under management at december  follow client type in billions institutional mutual funds private accounts and other asset class percentage equity fixed income money market real estate at december   assets under management of billion had increased billion from billion at december  in  institutional fixed income and risk adjusted equity products made the major contributions to the increase in assets under management 
net new business  including capital additions and reinvestments  was strong particularly in the first half of  with more than billion in net inflows from clients during the course of the year 
the operating partnership achieved these results despite the volatility in the equity markets where a relatively few large capitalization growth stocks had a disproportionate impact on the s p the operating partnership has a greater weighting of equity assets in the value investment style across large  mid and small capitalization issues which have historically produced very competitive long term returns but recently have resulted in the operating partnership s overall equity performance trailing the s p a continuing disparity in returns between value and large capitalization growth stocks in the future  should it occur  could negatively impact the operating partnership s ability to gather new equity assets under management 
statement of income for compared to net income of million for increased million from million for the increase resulted from higher average assets under management and the resulting increase in revenues  somewhat tempered by increased investment in distribution and marketing initiatives 
management and advisory fees of million for increased million or from total revenues of million in the revenue increase was especially concentrated in the first half of  coinciding with the operating partnership s higher average assets under management at that time as compared to institutional and private account revenues excluding acquisitions increased million in as compared to  with growth particularly strong in the fixed income and risk adjusted equity products 
mutual fund revenues increased million in as compared to this growth was generated primarily by asset increases in equity funds during the first half of for the full year  equity mutual funds had net client outflows of billion  which was more than offset by billion of inflows to money market funds and variable annuity products 
acquisitions completed in the second half of contributed an incremental million to institutional and private account revenues in other revenues and interest income of million for increased million from million for the increase resulted primarily from client servicing fees  including trading commissions and transfer agency fees 
compensation and benefits of million for increased million from and consisted of base compensation and of variable compensation 
the increase in variable compensation of million resulted from subsidiary incentive payments based on profitability  investment portfolio performance  new business sales  and participation in the subsidiaries growth in revenues and profits 
base compensation increased by million as a result of annual salary increases  increased staffing  and  to a much lesser extent  million of incremental expense from acquisitions completed in the second half of restricted unit plan compensation of million for increased million from due to grants issued in the first quarter of occupancy  equipment and systems expense of million for increased million from due to lease renewals  higher costs associated with expanded business activities and system initiatives 
interest expense of million for increased million from  primarily reflecting a full year s interest on the million of senior notes payable issued on april  other expense of million for increased million from due primarily to higher general and administrative expenses associated with expanded business activities  including distribution and marketing initiatives 
income tax expense of million for increased million from the increase results from higher profits at the corporate subsidiaries in statement of income for compared to net income of million for increased million from million for the increase primarily reflected higher revenues due to increases in assets under management from both internal growth and acquisitions 
management and advisory fees of million for increased million or from million for the increase primarily reflected increases in assets under management from both acquisitions and internal growth 
additionally  the increase in equity assets under management  with higher investment management fees compared to fixed income assets  contributed to the growth in revenues 
acquisitions  completed in may and december of and january and july of  represented million of the total increase in management and advisory fees 
excluding acquisitions  management and advisory fees increased million due to higher mutual fund revenues of million and higher institutional and private account revenues of million 
other revenues and interest income of million for increased million from million for the increase results primarily from equity in earnings of an affiliate

capital resources and liquidity operating cash flow not required for normal business operations and working capital needs  including support of the operating partnership s growth strategy and repurchase of units  is generally distributed to unitholders each quarter 
distributions to unitholders are typically declared during the last month of calendar quarters 
the operating partnership has the ability to make distributions in excess of net income due to its non cash amortization expense 
on december   the operating partnership declared a distribution of per unit compared to the per unit regular distribution declared in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   total distributions paid to unitholders were million compared to million for the operating partnership paid out approximately percent of its operating cash flow in distributions during senior notes of million and million due in january and april  respectively  are expected to be refinanced at maturity 
the interest rates of and on the million and million notes  respectively  are fixed rates 
the operating partnership had lines of credit totaling million which were unused at december  at december   the operating partnership had contingent payment obligations through resulting from completed acquisitions of up to million 
payment depends upon attainment of certain revenue targets by the businesses acquired 
such obligations are not expected to have a material impact on capital resources 
year the statements in this section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the year issue refers to problems that may result from computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable calendar year 
any computer programs that have date sensitive software or hardware may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year or experience a variety of other date related problems 
systems and programs that are not capable of handling year date issues could result in system failures or miscalculations that could cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
year issues arise in a number of different contexts in which the operating partnership and its affiliated operating companies use computer programming 
the operating companies generally rely heavily upon data processing and other services provided by third party service providers  including securities custody  transfer agency  trading and pricing services  and on a daily basis  trade through security exchanges which are highly automated 
in their operations  the companies also use both third party and internally developed software programs and rely on customary telecommunications services and building and property logistical services  including embedded computer controlled systems 
the operating partnership operates through separate  affiliated operating companies that provide investment management  distribution and consulting services 
each operating company has its own independent internal local access network lan computer system 
all of the operating companies lease their office space from third parties and certain of the operating companies conduct business through multiple locations in major cities 
although each operating company conducts business independently  many of the companies use similar third party software and have common relationships and dependencies with third party service providers 
management at each of the affiliated operating companies has responsibility for ensuring that year issues are addressed at the individual firm 
each operating company has identified a year project manager responsible for the company s year compliance effort 
in addition to existing technical and other personnel  certain of the operating companies have hired consultants to assist them in various aspects of the process of identifying  assessing  remediating and testing for their year projects 
the operating partnership provides coordination and assistance to the operating companies and has implemented regular meetings of the year project managers at the operating companies to enable them to share information and ideas and develop and coordinate strategies 
the operating partnership has also provided enhanced access to industry sponsored programs and testing initiatives and other assistance to certain of the operating companies 
progress on year initiatives is monitored by the audit committee of the board of directors of the managing general partner of the operating partnership and by the audit committees of each affiliated operating company 
the operating partnership and its affiliated operating companies have identified three principal stages of their year project management process assessment  including identification and inventory of information technology it programs  systems and equipment  non it systems  principally in buildings and offices  and external relationships and dependencies with third parties 
the assessment process includes a determination of whether the identified elements are year compliant including varying levels of testing for year compliance and  if necessary  the measures needed to be taken to make them compliant  implementation of repair  replacement and retirement projects necessary for programs and systems that are not year compliant  and testing of programs  systems  equipment and third party relationships and dependencies 
assessment 
the operating partnership and its affiliated operating companies believe that they have identified all material programs  systems  equipment and external relationships and dependencies 
the key systems and processes involving year issues for the operating companies generally include computer hardware and software relating to portfolio accounting systems and local area networks lans  the securities transaction settlement process and transfer agency functions  and customary logistical services associated with occupying buildings and property  including management of real estate for client portfolios 
the companies also believe that they have substantially completed the initial process of assessing year issues in their operations  including identification of the material projects necessary to allow the firms to operate and process data into the next century 
these projects are currently underway 
as these and other projects are completed  the key systems and processes will be tested for compliance with the year depending on the results of testing  additional projects may become necessary 
the companies have also made significant progress in obtaining information  including representations and or certifications in many cases  regarding the status of year compliance projects at third parties with whom they have relationships or dependencies  including firms providing broker dealer  securities custody  transfer agency  pricing and other services 
the operating companies will continue to seek information from third parties regarding their year readiness 
implementation 
the operating companies have already begun implementing steps required for their year projects  including repairing  replacing or modifying material programs and systems in order to be year compliant 
at certain operating companies  this process includes purchasing or developing new software systems that are year compliant  and the acceleration of planned replacement of systems  such as portfolio accounting systems  in conjunction with achieving year compliance 
most of these projects are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of testing 
the operating companies are establishing testing schedules for different aspects of their operations 
the scope of testing will vary from firm to firm depending on the nature of the firm s business and the need for testing 
the testing process is expected to include generally each operating company s internal hardware and software systems and  in certain cases  participation in individual  point to point testing with critical third party service providers and in industry wide testing 
the companies began internal and external testing in the fourth quarter of last year and expect to complete a substantial portion of planned testing by the end of the first quarter of this process will also involve examining the results of testing of internal systems and external relationships and dependencies  as appropriate  and review of information regarding the status of year compliance programs of third parties with which the firms have relationships and dependencies 
the operating partnership and the affiliated operating companies anticipate that the aggregate cost of their efforts to achieve year compliance will be between million 
these amounts represent the historical amounts spent and estimated future cost of purchasing replacement software and hardware  and modifying existing hardware and software for year compliance 
they include the cost of purchasing and implementing planned replacement of software such as portfolio accounting software that was accelerated  at least in part  due to year issues 
the estimated aggregate expense amount includes the cost of outside consultants engaged on year issues  but does not include salary and benefit expense of technical or other operating personnel at the firms 
through december   approximately million has been spent on year compliance efforts 
the cost of year planning and implementation is paid out of operating cash flow 
the operating partnership does not currently believe that such costs will  in the aggregate  cause the deferral of other material it projects at the operating companies as a group 
year costs are expected to constitute approximately one third of the aggregate it budget of the companies as a group for and management believes the cost of implementing the action plans for year compliance will not materially adversely affect the operating results or financial condition of nvest or the operating partnership 
each of the operating companies is considering the extent to which it is appropriate to develop contingency plans to address a failure of either internal or external systems due to year issues 
the operating companies expect to develop appropriate year contingency plans to address potential problems associated with critical internal systems and third party relationships and dependencies 
notwithstanding the year efforts undertaken and planned  one or more of the operating companies  and third parties with whom they have material relationships  may not achieve year compliance in a timely manner 
the operating partnership has not undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems or the related costs  including potential lost revenues that are reasonably likely to impact the operating partnership and its affiliated operating companies if this occurs 
given the different systems and business relationships of the operating companies  such an analysis on an aggregate basis for the operating partnership as a whole may not be practical in the short term 
however  as a general matter  taking into account the level of effort undertaken to date and planned to be taken  the operating partnership believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that  notwithstanding the year efforts of the operating partnership and the operating companies  one or more of the companies may experience difficulties in conducting all or a portion of normal business operations on behalf of clients for a period of time due to one or more mission critical system failures 
such difficulties could arise out of year problems experienced by one or more of the companies in their own it systems or in non it  embedded computer controlled systems in buildings in which they operate  such as a temporary inability to process or track trades and other transactions on behalf of clients in a timely manner 
difficulties experienced by essential third party service providers could also hinder  or in some cases  prevent  the companies from conducting normal business operations 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in evaluating at this time the extent to which such disruptions may occur despite the efforts to address year problems or the extent to which such disruptions could affect normal business operations  nvest is not able to estimate the amount of potential lost revenues or other losses that might result if such disruptions were in fact to occur 
however  if normal business operations were materially disrupted  it could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the operating partnership and nvest 
the businesses of the operating companies of the operating partnership are substantially dependent upon their ability to execute securities transactions and track changes in client portfolios 
if one or more of the operating companies experienced material difficulties due to year issues  or if the third parties with which the operating companies do business experienced such difficulties  it could have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations and business of the operating partnership as a whole 
this could  in turn  have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations of nvest 
the foregoing discussion includes statements that are not historical and are forward looking 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what was anticipated in the forward looking statements 
for example  the costs and projected completion dates for year compliance of the operating partnership and its affiliated operating companies are estimates 
factors relating to year issues that may cause material differences in actual results include the availability and cost of systems and personnel  non compliance of third party service providers  and similar uncertainties
