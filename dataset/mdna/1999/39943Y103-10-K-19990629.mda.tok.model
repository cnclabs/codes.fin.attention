group continually evaluates the credit and market risks associated with outstanding receivables 
in the course of this review  group considers many factors specific to the individual client as well as to the concentration of receivables within industry groups 
group s installment receivables are predominately with clients service bureaus who provide computer services to the direct marketing industry 
many of these clients have limited capital and insufficient assets to secure their liability with the group the service bureaus are highly dependent on group s software and services to offer their customers the economic benefit of postal discounts and mailing efficiency

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has a subsidiary in the united kingdom with offices in germany and denmark 
additionally  the company uses third party distributors to market and distribute its products in other international regions 
transactions conducted by the subsidiary are typically denominated in the local country currency  while transactions conducted by the distributors are typically denominated in pounds sterling 
as a results  the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of its subsidiary and third party distributors are translated into us dollars in consolidation
