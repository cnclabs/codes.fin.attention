other items affecting the company competition the apparel industry in the united states is highly competitive and characterized by a number of multi line manufacturers such as the company and a larger number of specialty manufacturers 
the company faces substantial competition in its markets from manufacturers in both categories 
apparel industry cycles and other economic factors the apparel industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  with consumer spending on apparel tending to decline during recessionary periods 
a decline in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects may affect consumer spending habits  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and its financial condition 
retail environment various retailers  including some of the company s customers  have experienced declines in revenue and profits in recent periods and some have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection 
to the extent that these financial difficulties continue  there can be no assurance that the company s financial condition and results of operations would not be adversely affected 
seasonality of business and fashion risk the company s principal products are organized into seasonal lines for resale at the retail level during the spring  summer  transition  fall and holiday seasons 
typically  the company s products are designed as much as one year in advance and manufactured approximately one season in advance of the related retail selling season 
accordingly  the success of the company s products is often dependent on the ability to successfully anticipate the needs of retail customers and the tastes of the ultimate consumer up to a year prior to the relevant selling season 
foreign operations the company s foreign sourcing operations are subject to various risks of doing business abroad  including indirect vulnerability to currency fluctuations  quotas and  in certain parts of the world  political instability 
any substantial disruption of its relationships with its foreign suppliers could adversely affect the company s operations 
some of the company s imported merchandise is subject to united states customs duties 
in addition  bilateral agreements between the major exporting countries and the united states impose quotas  which limit the amount of certain categories of merchandise that may be imported into the united states 
any material increase in duty levels  material decrease in quota levels or material decrease in available quota allocation could adversely affect the company s operations 
asian operations the company s operations in asia are subject to certain political and economic risks including  but not limited to  political instability  changing tax and trade regulations and currency devaluation s and controls 
the company s risks associated with the company s asian operations may be higher in than has historically been the case  due to the fact that financial markets in east and southeast asia continue to experience difficult conditions  including a currency crisis 
as a result of this economic volatility  the currencies of many countries in this region have lost value relative to the us dollar 
although the company has experienced no material foreign currency transaction losses since the beginning of the crisis  its operations in the region are subject to an increased level of economic instability 
approximately of the products sold by the company in fiscal were manufactured in asia 
the impact of these events on the company s business  and in particular its sources of supply  cannot be determined at this time 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon its ability to successfully design  manufacture  import and market apparel 
year issue the company recognizes the need for  and is in the final phases of implementation of  a comprehensive program intended to upgrade the operating systems  hardware and software  which should eliminate any issues involving year compliance

the company plans to complete this project prior to december   however  there can be no assurance that the systems of the other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company is currently evaluating its non information technology systems embedded technology issues and is also developing its contingency plans for its information technology systems and believes that it will complete both issues in time to accommodate year issues 
if the company is unsuccessful in completing remediation of non compliant systems  and if customers or vendors cannot rectify year issues  the company could incur additional costs  which may be substantial  to develop alternative methods of managing its business and replacing non compliant equipment  and may experience delays in receipts from vendors  shipments to customers  or payments to vendors
