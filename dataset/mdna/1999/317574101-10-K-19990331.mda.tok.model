fic currently owns  shares of ilco s common stock 
in addition  family life currently owns  shares of ilco common stock 
as a result  fic currently owns  directly and indirectly through family life   shares approximately of ilco s common stock 
prior to september   fic held options to acquire  shares of ilco s common stock

since the senior loan of ilco was fully repaid on september   fic s rights under the option agreement expired on september  the decline in long term interest rates during  which was related to general economic conditions  had a positive effect upon the market value of the fixed maturities available for sale segment of ilco s investment portfolio 
as of december   the market value of the fixed maturities available for sale segment was million as compared to an amortized cost of million  or an unrealized gain of million 
there is no assurance that this unrealized gain will be realized by ilco in the future 
since fic owns approximately of the common stock of ilco  such unrealized gains  net of tax  are reflected in fic s equity interest in ilco  and had the effect of increasing the reported value of such equity interest by approximately million 
ilco s results for include  for the period beginning on june   the operations of grinnell life insurance company 
grinnell life was acquired on june   through a subsidiary of ilco  for an adjusted purchase price of million 
a portion of the purchase price million was paid by way of a dividend to the seller immediately prior to the closing of the transaction  the balance of the purchase price was paid by ilco s subsidiary

liquidity and capital resources of ilco ilco is a holding company whose principal assets consist of the common stock of investors na and its subsidiary  investors life insurance company of indiana formerly intercontinental life insurance company 
ilco s primary source of funds consists of payments under the surplus debentures from investors na 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance of ilco s senior loan obligations was million  which reflected the prepayment by the company of the payment originally scheduled for january  a regular payment  in the amount of million  was made on april  and a prepayment of the july  installment  in the amount of million  was made on june  the outstanding principal balance of ilco s senior loan obligations was million at june  the final installment on the senior loan obligation scheduled for october   was prepaid on september  as a result  the senior loan obligation of ilco was fully discharged effective september  ilco s principal source of liquidity consists of the periodic payment of principal and interest by investors na  pursuant to the terms of the surplus debentures 
the surplus debentures were originally issued by standard life insurance company and their terms were previously approved by the mississippi insurance commissioner 
upon the merger of standard life into investors na  the obligations of the surplus debentures were assumed by investors na 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance of the surplus debentures was million and million  respectively 
since investors na is domiciled in the state of washington  the provisions of washington insurance law apply to the surplus debentures 
under the provisions of the surplus debentures and current law  no prior approval of the washington insurance commissioner is required for investors na to pay interest or principal on the surplus debentures  provided that  after giving effect to such payments  the statutory surplus of investors na is in excess of million the surplus floor 
however  investors na has voluntarily agreed with the washington insurance commissioner that it will provide at least five days advance notice of payments which it will make under the surplus debenture 
as of december   the statutory surplus of investors na was million  an amount substantially in excess of the surplus floor 
the funds required by investors na to meet its obligations to the company under the terms of the surplus debentures are derived from operating income generated from insurance and investment operations 
in addition to the payments under the terms of the surplus debentures  ilco has received dividends from its life insurance subsidiaries 
washington s insurance code includes the greater of standard for payment of dividends to shareholders  but has a requirement that prior notification of a proposed dividend be given to the washington insurance commissioner and that cash dividends may be paid only from earned surplus 
as of december   investors na had earned surplus of million 
since the law applies only to dividend payments  the ability of investors na to make principal and interest payments under the surplus debentures is not affected 
ilco does not anticipate that investors na will have any difficulty in making principal and interest payments on the surplus debentures for the foreseeable future 
investors in  formerly known as ilic  is domiciled in the state of indiana

under indiana law the dividend must be paid from earned surplus 
extraordinary dividend approval would be required where a dividend exceeds the greater of of surplus or the net gain from operations for the prior fiscal year 
investors in had earned surplus of million at december  the form ks of ilco for the years ended december   and  set forth the business operations and financial results of ilco and its life insurance subsidiaries 
such k reports of ilco  including the discussion by ilco s management under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations are incorporated herein by reference 
liquidity and capital resources fic is a holding company whose principal assets consist of the common stock of family life and its equity ownership in ilco 
fic s primary sources of capital consists of cash flow from operations of its subsidiaries and the proceeds from bank and institutional borrowings 
the principal source of liquidity for fic s subsidiaries consists of the periodic payment of principal and interest by family life pursuant to the terms of a surplus debenture 
the terms of the surplus debenture were previously approved by the washington insurance commissioner 
under the provisions of the surplus debenture and current law  no prior approval of the washington insurance department is required for family life to pay interest or principal on the surplus debenture  provided that  after giving effect to such payments  the statutory surplus of family life is in excess of of assets the surplus floor 
however  family life has voluntarily agreed with the washington insurance commissioner that it will provide at least five days advance notice of payments which it will make under the surplus debenture 
as of december   the statutory capital and surplus of family life was million  an amount substantially in excess of the surplus floor 
during  family life made principal payments of million and interest payments of million to family life corporation under the surplus debenture 
as of december   the principal balance of the surplus debenture was million 
the funds required by family life to meet its obligations under the terms of the surplus debenture are generated primarily from premium payments from policyholders  investment income and the proceeds from the sale and redemption of portfolio investments 
washington s insurance code includes the greater of standard for dividends but has requirements that prior notification of a proposed dividend be given to the washington insurance commissioner and that cash dividends may be paid only from earned surplus 
family life does not presently have earned surplus as defined by the regulations adopted by the washington insurance commissioner and  therefore  is not permitted to pay cash dividends 
however  since the new law applies only to dividend payments  the ability of family life to make principal and interest payments under the surplus debenture is not affected 
the company does not anticipate that family life will have any difficulty in making principal and interest payments on the surplus debenture in the amounts necessary to enable family life corporation to service its indebtedness for the foreseeable future 
the sources of funds for family life consist of premium payments from policyholders  investment income and the proceeds from the sale and redemption of portfolio investments 
these funds are applied primarily to provide for the payment of claims under insurance and annuity policies  operating expenses  taxes  investments in portfolio securities  shareholder dividends and payments under the provisions of the surplus debenture 
fic s net cash flow provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in net cash flow used in financing activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in the guaranty commitments of fic under the loans incurred in connection with the acquisition of family life after taking into account the repayments and new loans which occurred in july  relate to i the million note issued by family life corporation to investors life insurance company of north america  and ii the million loaned by investors na to two subsidiaries of fic 
management believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are sufficient to meet the needs of its business and to satisfy debt service 
investments as of december   the company s investment assets totaled million  as compared to million as of december  the level of short term investments at the end of was million  as compared to million as of december  the fixed maturities available for sale portion represents million of investment assets as of december   as compared to million at the end of the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale as of december  was million representing a net unrealized gain of million 
this unrealized gain principally reflects changes in interest rates from the date the respective investments were purchased 
to reduce the exposure to interest rate changes  portfolio investments are selected so that diversity  maturity and liquidity factors approximate the duration of associated policyholder liabilities 
the assets held by family life must comply with applicable state insurance laws and regulations 
in selecting investments for the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiaries  the company s emphasis is to obtain targeted profit margins  while minimizing the exposure to changing interest rates 
this objective is implemented by selecting primarily short to medium term  investment grade fixed income securities 
in making such portfolio selections  the company generally does not select new investments which are commonly referred to as high yield or non investment grade 
the fixed maturities portfolio of family life  as of december   consisted solely of fixed maturities investments which  in the annual statements of the companies  as filed with state insurance departments  were designated under the national association of insurance commissioners naic rating system as a highest quality 
management believes that the absence of high yield or non investment grade investments as defined above in the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiary enhances the ability of the company to service its debt  provide security to its policyholders and to credit relatively consistent rates of return to its policyholders 
yk compliance the company and its subsidiaries utilize a centralized computer system to process policyholder records and financial information 
in addition  the company uses non centralized computer terminals in connection with its operations 
the software programs used in connection with these systems will be affected by what is referred to as the yk date problem 
this refers to the limitations of the programming code in certain existing software programs to recognize date sensitive information as the year approaches 
unless modified prior to the year  such systems may not properly recognize such information and could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail to operate properly 
the company has evaluated its centralized computer systems and has developed a plan to reach yk compliance 
a central feature of the plan is to convert most of the centralized systems to a common system which is already in compliance with yk requirements 
the company is in the process of this systems conversion and anticipates that the project will be completed in advance of the year the company has increased the budget for the implementation and completion of the plan from the prior years estimate 
as of december   the company had budgeted approximately  for implementing the plan 
based on its current analysis  the company expects that the cost of implementing and completing the plan will result in an after tax expense of approximately  for the three year conversion period 
for the twelve month period ended december   the company has incurred an after tax expense of approximately  in connection with the completion of the plan 
between january  and december   the company has expended approximately of the three year expected after tax cost discussed above 
the plan calls for an upgrade of the family life s administrative systems by changing individual lines of computer code in order to modify current operating software such that it will become yk compliant 
this process includes approximately sub systems which provide data input to the main systems 
the administrative systems which are not modified will be converted onto the company s ck system  a system designed to be yk compliant according to the representations of the vendor 
the systems which administer a substantial number of family life policies will be modified rather than converted 
the modification of the pms system administering approximately  policies for family life was completed in march  the conversion of the cypros ap system administering approximately  active policies for family life is scheduled for completion at the end of september  a small number of family life policies are administered by systems which also administer policies for ilco and its subsidiaries 
with regard to ilco and its subsidiaries  the alis system administering approximately  active policies for investors na at the time of conversion was converted to ck in january of the conversion of the life system administering approximately  active policies for investors in is scheduled for completion in april  the modification of the lifecomm b system which is responsible for the  active policies assumed after ilco s acquisition of state auto life is also scheduled for completion in april  the conversion of the lifecomm a system administering approximately  active policies for investors na is now scheduled for completion in september of the company also faces the risk that one or more of its external suppliers of goods or services third party providers will not be in a position to properly interact with the company due to the inability of such third party provider to resolve its own yk issues 
the company has completed an inventory of its third party provider relationships 
in order to assess the yk readiness of such third party providers  the company has developed and forwarded a detailed questionnaire to such providers 
as the responses to the questionnaires are received  the company will evaluate the overall yk readiness of its third party provider relationships 
however  the company does not have sufficient information at the current time to determine whether the computer systems of its third party providers will be in compliance with the yk requirements as the year approaches 
in  fic computer services a subsidiary of fic which provides data processing services for the company and its affiliates purchased new mainframe hardware and accompanying operating software  which the vendor has represented to be yk compliant 
this hardware and software was tested in the telephone system has been tested by the maintenance provider for that system and the company has received assurances that the telephone system is yk compliant 
with respect to non centralized systems ie  desktop computers  the company has obtained updated software releases and new hardware designed to be yk compliant according to the representations of the vendors 
the company expects that the effort needed to correct for yk problems on such systems will be less time intensive than the effort needed to achieve compliance for its centralized systems 
the installation of such new pc hardware and software was commenced in early and is expected to be completed by september  in the event that a major administrative system fails to operate properly due to the yk problem  or the company does not complete the necessary systems conversions prior to january   the company has developed a plan to respond to such a contingency 
fic computer services has assigned certain personnel to be members of an emergency response team to resolve yk operations problems 
additionally  insurance policies would be administered manually if the necessary systems conversions were not completed prior to january   or subsequent yk operations problems persist 
manual policy administration would require additional personnel 
if substantial additional personnel become necessary for manual policy administration  the training and salary expenses of such personnel could materially affect the company s business and results of operations 
the company is not able to estimate the likelihood that manual administration will be needed or the amount of any expense which it would incur in connection with such manual administration 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of except for historical factual information set forth in this management s discussion and analysis  certain statements made in this report are forward looking and contain information about financial results  economic conditions  yk risks and other risks and known uncertainties 
the company cautions the reader that actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the company  depending upon the eventual outcome of certain factors  including heightened competition for new business  significant changes in interest rates  adverse regulatory changes affecting the business of insurance and adverse changes in the yk readiness of the company or its significant third party providers
