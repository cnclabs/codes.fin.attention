impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs historically being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal day to day operations 
the company has developed a comprehensive plan to address the year issue 
the plan addresses three main phases a information systems  b embedded chips  and c supply chain readiness including customers as well as inventory and non inventory suppliers 
to oversee the process  the company has established a steering committee comprised of executives and chaired by the company s senior executive vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer 
the committee reports regularly to the board of directors and the audit committee 
the company retained the services of a third party consultant with year expertise to evaluate the company s year plan and make recommendations 
as of december   the company is vigorously remediating software and hardware deficiencies caused by the year issue and is at various stages of completion 
major business systems are currently being addressed and in some cases are already complete  as in the case of the company s financial reporting  accounts payable and manufacturing and distribution systems 
human resource systems are currently being remediated and are on schedule to be completed by the latter part of the company will perform year integrated testing for system interoperability in the second and third quarters of the company continues to believe that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications or conversions are not made  or are not completed timely on the remaining critical business systems  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
based on the work completed to date  the company continues to anticipate that remediation will be substantially completed prior to december substantial progress has been made in the certification of restaurant systems and hardware 
the company has completed an inventory of restaurant hardware  and various remediation strategies have been identified and successfully tested for all classes of equipment 
a detailed plan for retrofits has been completed 
the retrofits should essentially be complete by june software for non compliant point of sale systems has been successfully remediated and tested 
revised point of sale software should be in all restaurants in march other key restaurant software applications have also been certified 
the remaining software applications are not expected to pose major problems and will be addressed in the second quarter of however  further testing of all applications will continue throughout the year 
embedded chip technology poses the most difficult challenge 
the company s focus has been directed at the manufacturing and distribution operations 
as of december   all critical manufacturing functions have been evaluated and questionable equipment hardware is continually remediated in order to be compliant 
the issues that currently remain open are non critical in nature and should not impair the company s ability to conduct business 
the company continues to monitor its communications environment both internally and externally and will react as developments occur 
the company continues to take vigorous steps to monitor year supply chain readiness by evaluating written assurances from over business critical suppliers 
as of december   the company is aggressively evaluating a small number of suppliers that the company believes may not be compliant by december the company also continues to identify alternate sources wherever appropriate 
if any of the company s suppliers or customers do not  or if the company itself does not  successfully deal with the year issue  the company could experience delays in receiving or sending goods that would increase its costs and that could cause the company to lose business and even customers and could subject the company to claims for damages 
problems with the year issue could also result in delays in the company invoicing its customers or in the company receiving payments from them that would affect the company s liquidity 
problems with the year issue could affect the activities of the company s customers to the point that their demand for the company s products is reduced 
the severity of these possible problems would depend on the nature of the problem and how quickly it could be corrected or an alternative implemented  which is unknown at this time 
in the extreme  such problems could bring the company to a standstill 
as the company enters into  it will continue to evaluate the business environment and will develop contingency plans for systems and resources in order to conduct its normal day to day business operations 
as previously noted  some risks of the year issue are beyond the control of the company  its suppliers and customers 
for example  no preparations or contingency plan will protect the company from a down turn in economic activity caused by the possible ripple effect throughout the entire economy that could be caused by problems of others with the year issue 
the company s total year project cost includes the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for the system improvement and year modifications 
the total cost of the system improvement and the year project is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  approximately million is attributable to the purchase of new software and hardware which will be capitalized 
the remaining million  which will be expensed as incurred  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
to date  the company has incurred approximately million million expensed and million capitalized for new systems related to system improvements and the year project 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   the company has a federal net operating loss nol carryforward of million 
because of a change of ownership of the company under section of the internal revenue code on march  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  million of the nol carryforward can be used only to offset current or future taxable income to the extent that any additional net unrealized built in gains which existed at march  are recognized by march  the common stock offering in november resulted in the company having another change of ownership under section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  in tax years ending after the common stock offering  the company is limited in how much of its nols it can utilize 
the amount of nol s which may be used each year prior to any built in gains being triggered is approximately million 
the nols expire  if unused  between and in addition  the nol carryforwards are subject to adjustment upon review by the internal revenue service see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation the inflationary factors which have historically affected the company s results of operations include increases in the costs of cream  sweeteners  purchased food  labor and other operating expenses 
approximately of wages paid in the company s restaurants are impacted by changes in the federal or state minimum hourly wage rate 
accordingly  changes in the federal or states minimum hourly wage rate directly affect the company s labor cost 
the company is able to minimize the impact of inflation on occupancy costs by owning the underlying real estate for approximately of its restaurants 
the company and the restaurant industry typically attempt to offset the effect of inflation  at least in part  through periodic menu price increases and various cost reduction programs 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future 
seasonality due to the seasonality of frozen dessert consumption  and the effect from time to time of weather on patronage of the restaurants  the company s revenues and ebitda are typically higher in its second and third quarters 
geographic concentration approximately of the company owned restaurants are located  and substantially all of its retail sales are generated  in the northeast 
as a result  a severe or prolonged economic recession or changes in demographic mix  employment levels  population density  weather  real estate market conditions or other factors specific to this geographic region may adversely affect the company more than certain of its competitors which are more geographically diverse
