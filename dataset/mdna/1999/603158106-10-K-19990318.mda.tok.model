item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold marketing  distribution and administrative expenses research and development expenses income from operations net income overview of and outlook in  the company adhered to its strategy of expanding its precipitated calcium carbonate pcc product line within the specialty minerals segment 
the company commenced operations at four new satellite pcc plants in three different countries and signed agreements for construction of two large satellite plants  one in china and one in the united states 
together  the plants under construction have production capacity equivalent to approximately nine satellite units and are scheduled to begin operations in the first half of a satellite unit is equivalent to annual production capacity of between  and  tons of pcc 
the company also contracted for the addition of a large pcc coating facility at an existing satellite plant in finland and acquired a pcc business in the united kingdom 
the patented acid tolerant pcc technology continues to show growth and the groundwood sector of the worldwide paper industry continues to show widespread interest in this product 
in addition  the company expanded several satellite plants at various locations around the world 
as a result  sales of pcc as a percentage of the company s total net sales  which were in  had risen to by the company expects this trend to continue as volume growth of pcc continues to outpace growth in the processed minerals product line and the refractories segment 
the company now operates or has under construction satellite pcc plants in countries worldwide 
the company is optimistic that volume growth will continue in the company expects additional expansions at existing satellite pcc plants to occur in and also expects to sign contracts for additional satellite pcc plants 
in  the company plans to continue its focus on the following growth strategies for the pcc product line continued efforts to increase market penetration in north america  europe  latin america  and the pacific rim 
continued expansions of the capacity of existing satellite pcc plants in response to increased demand  which is resulting from either increased pcc filler levels in paper or the installation of new paper machines 
continued research and development and marketing efforts of acid tolerant pcc  coating pcc and other products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term agreements  generally ten years in length  with paper mills at which the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
to date  the company s experience with extensions and renewals of its satellite pcc agreements has been favorable 
there is no assurance  however  that these contracts will be renewed prior to their respective expiration dates 
the company will continue to emphasize specialty products in its refractories segment product lines and to commercialize products  processes and equipment through research and development efforts 
as the company continues to expand its operations overseas  it faces the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including exchange rate fluctuations  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds and other factors 
in addition  the company s performance depends to some extent on that of the industries it serves  particularly the paper  steel and construction industries 
results of operations net sales dollars in millions growth growth net sales worldwide net sales in increased over the previous year to million 
the stronger us dollar had an unfavorable impact of approximately million or percentage points on sales growth 
sales in the specialty minerals segment  which includes the pcc and processed minerals product lines  grew while sales in the refractories segment declined 
in  worldwide net sales increased over the prior year to million 
the specialty minerals segment sales increased and the refractories segment sales increased in worldwide net sales of pcc in increased to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the commencement of operations at four new satellite pcc plants in and to the acquisition of a pcc business in the united kingdom 
in addition  a full year of operations at several satellite pcc plants that began operations in and volume increases from the company s long standing satellite pcc plants also contributed to the sales growth 
foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of approximately million on sales growth 
pcc sales in increased to million from million in this growth was primarily attributable to the start up of operations at five new satellite plants that began operations in and volume increases generated by the company s long standing satellite pcc plants 
net sales of processed minerals decreased in in april  the company divested its midwest limestone business in port inland  michigan 
references to ongoing operations exclude the results from this facility 
net sales from the midwest limestone business in were million 
net sales from this facility in  prior to the divestiture  were million 
net sales of processed mineral products from ongoing operations decreased to million from million in this decrease was due largely to the refocus of the talc product line on higher margin customers and products and to the use of the company s lime to produce pcc instead of selling the lime to third parties 
net sales of processed minerals in rose 
this growth was primarily attributable to higher volumes 
in  sales of pyrolytic graphite products  previously reported in the processed minerals product line  were reported in the refractories segment 
prior year s sales have been reclassified to reflect this change 
net sales in the refractories segment in decreased to million from million in the prior year 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange  the sales decrease was approximately 
in the second half of  the economic conditions in the worldwide steel industry deteriorated  which had a negative effect on the refractories segment sales 
in both and  strategic replacement of commodity products with specialty products and systems increased the profitability of this product line 
in  net sales in the refractories segment increased from the prior year 
net sales from ongoing operations in the united states in increased 
this increase was attributable to the growth in the pcc product line 
foreign sales in increased  primarily as a result of the continued international expansion of the company s pcc product line 
in  domestic net sales were higher than in the prior year as a result of increased sales in the specialty minerals segment 
foreign sales were approximately greater than in the prior year  primarily due to growth in the pcc product line 
operating costs and expenses dollars in millions growth growth cost of goods sold marketing  distribution and administrative research and development cost of goods sold was of sales 
this ratio was lower than the prior year and was primarily attributable to improved profitability in the refractories segment and the processed minerals product lines within the specialty minerals segment

income from operations dollars in millions growth growth income from operations income from operations in increased to million from million in this increase was due primarily to improved profitability in both the specialty minerals segment and the refractories segment and to solid growth in the pcc product line within the specialty minerals segment 
the specialty minerals segment s improved profitability was primarily due to the turnaround in the processed minerals product line 
the refractories segment s improved profitability was due to the continued emphasis on new higher margin specialty products and delivery systems 
however  the recent downturn in the worldwide steel industry has negatively affected the sales and profitability of the refractories segment 
in  income from operations rose to million from million in this increase was due primarily to solid growth in the pcc product line within the specialty minerals segment  and to improved profitability in the refractories segment 
operating profits were negatively impacted by startup costs associated with the five new satellite pcc plants and some weakness in the processed minerals product line  specifically in talc products 
non operating deductions dollars in millions growth growth non operating deductions  net non operating deductions in decreased from the prior year due to lower net interest expense and lower foreign exchange losses 
gross interest expense decreased from the prior year to million

the company expects to meet its long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  the aforementioned uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
prospective information and factors that may affect future results the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this annual report contains such forward looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as anticipate  estimate  expects  projects  and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
the company cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although it believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements 
discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions follow and are discussed under the heading entitled cautionary factors that may affect future results in item inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse impact on the company 
the contracts pursuant to which the company constructs and operates its satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of the company s sales are to customers in the paper and steel industries  which have historically been cyclical 
both industries encountered difficulties in  which in most markets have been more price driven than volume driven 
the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
for this reason  and because of the geographical diversification of our business  the company s operating results to date have not been materially affected by the difficult economic environment 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that a recession  in some markets or worldwide  would not have a significant negative impact on the company s financial position or results of operations

year the year issue arises because many computer programs and electronically controlled devices denote years using only the last two digits 
because these programs and devices may fail to recognize the year correctly  calculations or other tasks that involve the year may cause them to produce erroneous results or to fail altogether 
like other companies  the company uses operating systems  applications and electronically controlled devices that were produced by many different vendors at different times  and many of which were not originally designed to be year compatible 
in  the company began the installation of new computer hardware and software to improve the capability of the company s information systems  to harmonize the various information technology platforms in use  and to centralize certain financial functions 
the project encompasses corporate financial and accounting functions as well as manufacturing and costing  procurement  planning and scheduling of production and maintenance  and customer order management 
the company has acquired much of the hardware and software required to implement this project  and is currently bringing its domestic business locations on to the new systems sequentially 
this is proceeding according to schedule  and the company expects the new systems to be operational in all affected us locations no later than the third quarter of other us manufacturing locations are currently year ready  with the exception of three locations which are serviced by an information technology system which is in the process of being upgraded 
this upgrade is scheduled to be completed no later than the second quarter of other preparations for the year are being carried out by the relevant business units on a decentralized basis 
information technology systems outside the united states are in the process of being evaluated and repaired or replaced as required 
the company expects this process to be completed by all non us locations no later than the third quarter of the company s exposures to the year issue other than in the area of information technology arise mostly with respect to process control systems and instrumentation at the company s manufacturing locations  and in equipment used at customer locations 
telephone and e mail systems  operating systems and applications in free standing personal computers  local area networks and site services such as electronic security systems and elevators may also be affected 
a failure of these systems  which interrupted the company s ability to supply products to its customers  could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations 
these issues are being addressed by the individual business units  by obtaining from vendors and service providers either necessary modifications to the software or assurance that the system will not be disrupted by the year issue 
this process is expected to be completed no later than the third quarter of the company expects to spend approximately million  including internal costs  before january   for new computer hardware and software  other information technology upgrades and replacements  and upgrades and replacements to non it systems worldwide 
these expenditures will provide benefits to the company which include but are not limited to the achievement of year readiness 
of this amount approximately million had been expended as of december  these expenditures will be capitalized or expensed in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which the company has adopted 
the company expects to finance these expenditures solely from working capital  and does not expect the total cost associated with its plans to address the year issue to have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations 
none of the company s other information technology projects have been delayed due to the implementation of year solutions 
like other companies  the company relies on its customers for revenues  on its suppliers for raw materials and on its other vendors for products and services of all kinds  these third parties all face the year issue 
an interruption in the ability of any of them to provide goods or services  or to pay for goods or services provided to them  or an interruption in the business operations of customers causing a decline in demand for the company s products  could have a material adverse effect on the company in turn 
in particular  each of the company s satellite pcc plants relies on one customer for most or all of its business  and in many cases for raw materials as well  so that a shutdown of the host paper mill s operation would also cause the satellite pcc plant to shut down 
the company s divisions are communicating with their principal customers and vendors about their year readiness  and expect this process to be completed no later than the third quarter of none of the responses received to date suggests that any significant customer or vendor expects the year issue to cause an interruption in its operations  which would have a material adverse impact on the company 
however  because so many firms are exposed to the risk of failure not only of their own systems  but of the systems of other firms  the ultimate effect of the year issue is subject to a very high degree of uncertainty 
the company believes that its preparations currently under way are adequate to assess and manage the risks presented by the year issue  and does not have a formal contingency plan at this time 
the statements in this section regarding the effect of the year and the company s responses to it are forward looking statements 
they are based on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable in light of its current knowledge and experience 
a number of contingencies could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
please see cautionary factors that may affect future results in item adoption of a common european currency on january   eleven european countries adopted the euro as their common currency 
from that date until january   debtors and creditors may choose to pay or be paid in euros or in the former national currencies 
on and after january   the former national currencies will cease to be legal tender 
the company is currently reviewing its information technology systems and upgrading them as necessary to ensure that it will be able to convert among the former national currencies and the euro  and process transactions and balances in euros  as required 
the company has sought and received assurances from the financial institutions with which it does business that they are capable of receiving deposits and making payments both in euros and in the former national currencies 
the company does not expect that adapting its information technology systems to the euro will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company is also reviewing contracts with customers and vendors calling for payments in currencies that are to be replaced by the euro  and intends to complete in a timely way any required changes to those contracts 
adoption of the euro is likely to have competitive effects in europe  as prices that had been stated in different national currencies become directly comparable to one another 
in addition  the adoption of a common monetary policy throughout the countries adopting the euro can be expected to have an effect on the economy of the region 
these competitive and economic effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and there can be no assurance that they will not have a material effect on the company s business in europe 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts would not subject the company to additional risk from exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
there were no open forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  or december
