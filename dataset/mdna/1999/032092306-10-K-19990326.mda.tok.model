item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report 
product groups the company s principal product groups are data systems mass data storage and instrumentation recorder products and its professional video and other products  and micronet s disk based storage products 
ampex has recently made several strategic investments in internet video production and distribution businesses 
while ampex believes that a significant percentage of its resources will be devoted to this business segment in and beyond  at year end the investments were not material to its financial position 
also  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for investments where ownership interest is under  ampex has not included in its consolidated financial results of operations any portion of the losses which these companies have incurred to date 
adsc s mass data storage and instrumentation products group includes i millimeter scanning recorders and library systems dst and dis products and related tape and after market equipment  and ii data acquisition and instrumentation products primarily dcrsi instrumentation recorders and related tape and after market equipment 
the professional video and other products group includes primarily its dct video recorders and related tape products and television aftermarket equipment 
the company s micronet products include disk arrays datadock and genesis products and storage area network products 
these product groups are described below 
no other class of similar products accounted for more than of net sales during the comparison periods discussed below 
the following table shows sales of the company s products by product group for the past three years 
net sales in millions ampex data systems corporation mass data storage and instrumentation products professional video and other products micronet technology  inc disk based storage products total net sales results of operations for the three years ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased by to million in from million in  compared to million in in  the sales decline was primarily due to lower sales of adsc s instrumentation products to government customers and a decline in sales of television aftermarket products 
these sales declines were offset in part by the inclusion of net sales of micronet from july  in  the sales decline was primarily due to lower sales across all of adsc s product lines 
in and  the majority of adsc s commercial sales of millimeter mass data storage libraries and tape drives were to the oil and gas industry for use in seismic data gathering and analysis 
activity in this market has declined in due to capital budget restrictions that have been imposed on the oil and gas exploration companies and other industry conditions 
beginning in  adsc has sold a limited number of its dst tape libraries to television broadcasters and cable networks 
the company believes this market may represent its largest commercial opportunity for the sale of its dst product line for the next several years 
in each of the past three years  government agencies and defense contractors have been the largest market for adsc s mass data storage and instrumentation recorders 
this market has experienced significant pressures to reduce spending which has had an adverse affect on sales in each of the years in the reporting period 
during  the company made its first internet investment that is being carried on the books using the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method of accounting  an investor carries its investment at cost and does not record its equity interest in losses or income of the investee 
subsequent to year end  the company has announced additional investments in internet video producers and distributors 
ampex has options to acquire control of each of these businesses 
at such time ampex increases its equity interest in these companies over its initial investment  ampex will include its equity interest in losses prospectively generated by these companies 
ampex s equity in the losses of its internet video affiliates may be material to consolidated results of operations in future years 
the company s backlog of firm orders decreased to million at december  from million at december  the company typically operates with low levels of backlog  requiring it to obtain the vast majority of each period s orders in the same period that they must be shipped to the customer 
historically  a small number of large orders has significantly impacted sales levels and often orders are received late in the quarter making it difficult to predict sales levels in future periods 
see business fluctuations in operating results  seasonality  backlog 
data systems mass data storage and instrumentation recorder products 
sales of adsc s mass data storage products and instrumentation recorders and related after market products totaled million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
a significant portion of the company s product sales reflects purchases by government agencies and defense contractors pursuant to federal government procurement programs 
these sales fluctuate as a result of changes in government spending programs including defense programs  and seasonal procurement practices of government agencies 
sales of the company s dst and dis products decreased slightly in compared to the comparable period of during  the company received a limited number of orders from television broadcasters and cable stations for its mass data storage tape drives and library systems for use in digital storage archive applications 
the company believes that this customer base may elect over several years to reformat their existing videotape libraries to digital standards such as dst in order to achieve greater operational flexibility and efficiency 
the company is actively pursuing strategic partnering arrangements with leading video server hardware and software companies in order to broaden its reach into this market beyond its in house sales and marketing resources 
additionally  to preserve competitiveness  the company will be required to invest in improving the capabilities of its products 
for example  the maximum capacity per cartridge of the first generation dst tape drive was gigabytes 
the company is currently delivering products with a maximum capacity of gigabytes per cartridge double density and is accepting orders for future delivery of products with a maximum capacity of gigabytes per cartridge quadruple density 
the cost efficiency of adsc s millimeter storage systems has historically been dependent on data intensive applications  such as those which incorporate video  graphics and other images  requiring storage capacity materially greater than those required by traditional alphanumeric applications 
the company has concentrated its sales and marketing efforts primarily in government intelligence gathering and surveillance activities and specialized commercial vertical markets  such as digital special effects creation  d seismic data gathering and analysis and digital archival storage of television program libraries 
these image intensive applications can utilize the unique performance capabilities of the company s millimeter scanning recorders 
in october  the company received a memorandum of understanding for the purchase  subject to the exercise of certain customer options  of up to an estimated million of dst double density and quadruple density storage systems for a government program on which the company had previously submitted proposals 
separately  also in october  the company received a letter of intent relating primarily to the purchase of several of the company s recently introduced dst automated tape libraries for approximately million for another government program 
in both cases  deliveries would occur during the period sales of the above products are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements and terms and conditions with the respective customers  and there can be no assurance that satisfactory contracts will be completed or that any firm orders will result 
the company continues to propose on additional domestic and foreign government programs 
typically such proposals are part of larger capital projects  which involve risks or delays beyond the company s control 
since such orders often are relatively large  the receipt or loss of a significant order can materially affect quarterly sales and results of operations 
additionally  larger programs frequently schedule deliveries of the company s products over an extended period 
the company does not currently anticipate that such new large programs will generate material revenue in the first half of  and that sales levels of adsc s products will be at or below levels realized during recent quarters in a significant portion of instrumentation product sales reflect purchases by the federal government 
direct and indirect sales to us government agencies amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of net sales in those years 
while sales to government agencies have historically consisted primarily of data acquisition and instrumentation recorders  the company has recently experienced an increase in sales of millimeter based data storage products to these customers 
sales to government agencies fluctuate as a result of changes in government spending programs including defense programs  and may be adversely impacted by congressional appropriations discussions 
the company is unable to forecast the extent to which sales may be adversely affected in future periods by these factors 
data systems professional video recording and other products 
as anticipated  sales of professional video recording products and all other products consisting primarily of television after market products continued to decline to million in from million in and million in the company s dct digital products were designed for existing broadcast transmission standards  which are expected to become obsolete upon the adoption of new digital transmission standards that were recently announced 
the company anticipates that its professional video product sales will continue to decline pending the establishment of new standards and until new products can be introduced that are designed for them 
the company also anticipates a continuing reduction in the sale of television after market products for these same reasons 
such sales declines could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance as to when broadcasters will re equip for the new transmission standards or whether the company will be successful in any future efforts it may undertake to design and sell new products based on such standards 
micronet products 
the company has included the operations of micronet in its consolidated results of operations since its acquisition effective june  sales of micronet products for this period in totaled million 
the company believes that micronet sales levels during this period have been adversely impacted by the decision to withdraw from lower priced product lines and to refocus on higher performance disk array products such as the datadock the company is developing a new generation of disk arrays the genesis product line that offer substantially improved capacity  performance and features  such as fibre channel connectivity 
these products are scheduled for shipment in the first half of gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales were in  in and in the decline in the gross margin percentage in compared to reflects the inclusion of micronet products that have lower margins than adsc s product sales  a lower proportion of instrumentation product sales which have higher gross profit margin than other sales  and an overall decline in sales volume that resulted in lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the improved gross margin percentage in compared to reflects the effects of the company s cost containment activities  which reduced fixed manufacturing and administrative costs in the period  as well as an improved sales mix of newer  high margin products 
the company believes that sales of relatively high margin instrumentation recorders will continue to be adversely affected by pressure on government agencies to further reduce spending 
accordingly  gross margins in future periods will be adversely affected 
also  the company may elect to use aggressive pricing as a marketing strategy to enter new markets for its storage products 
while these efforts would be designed ultimately to increase revenues and profitability  they might reduce the gross margin percentage of net sales in the future periods 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in and million of net sales in in  selling and administrative costs include micronet expenditures of million and an actuarial valuation of certain supplemental pension plans of million 
the company incurred million of patent infringement expenses in compared to million in and million in  relating to patent infringement litigation with a foreign consumer products manufacturer 
excluding such costs  selling and administrative costs declined in compared to as a result of savings realized in facility operating costs after relocating the company s headquarters into smaller facilities 
the company anticipates that it will need to increase its sales and marketing efforts to be successful in penetrating the commercial data markets with its millimeter storage products  increase sales at micronet due to its new product offerings in early  and bring together the necessary capabilities to build the company s presence in internet video markets 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the company does not capitalize any rd e expenditures 
the majority of rd e expenses in each of these years was used to enhance the price performance levels of the company s mass data storage products  as well as to integrate the company s storage systems with various computer manufacturers servers  workstations and other computer systems 
in and  the company spent million and million  respectively  in the development of keepered media technology for use in hard disk drives 
the keepered media development program was substantially completed during  at which time it was transferred to a long term research and development project to assess whether the technology might be commercially employed with advanced head technologies 
continuing expenses for keepered media research are not significant 
the company is committed to investing in research  development and engineering programs at levels that can be supported by current levels of sales 
acquisition of in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of micronet  the independent appraisal of the in process research and development resulted in the recording of a one time million charge in the second quarter of at the acquisition date  micronet was in process of developing four significant enhancements to its data dock product line which had not reached technological feasibility and for which there was no future alternative use 
these projects included o the first generation genesis product  a disk array offering a scalable  variable raid configured disk array offering up to terabyte of capacity and fiber channel interface for broadband users  o the second generation genesis product that will incorporate a fiber channel back plane to permit fiber channel connectivity to fiber channel disk drives  o data dock products offering a low voltage differential compatible back plane to connect to ultra scsi ii channels between the disk array and host computer  o data dock products offering ethernet connectivity permitting local and remote monitoring via tcp ip networks and standard web browsers for multiple user workgroup environments 
the classification of each research and development project as complete or under development was made in accordance with the guidelines of sfas  sfas and fin the above development projects were estimated to be completed within months of the acquisition date and between and complete  based on engineering estimates of hours incurred to date and hours expected to be required to complete technological feasibility per project 
the company s development effort involves storage subsystem design and includes software  firmware and electronics design to tie together disk drives and third party hardware drive mechanisms 
micronet s design philosophy is to incorporate off the shelf technology as it becomes available and proven in the marketplace  and to focus its design activities on ease of use  reliability  security  durability and similar enhancements 
as a result  its development activities can be budgeted with a fair degree of precision 
all in process research and development r d projects continue to progress  in all material respects  consistently with the assumptions that micronet provided to the independent appraiser for use in the valuation of the in process r d 
the company used an independent appraisal firm to assist it with its valuation of the fair market value of the purchased assets of micronet and the valuation of the consideration issued 
fair market value is defined as the estimated amount at which an asset might be expected to be exchanged between a willing buyer and willing seller  assuming the buyer continues to use the assets in their current operations 
micronet provided assumptions by product line of revenue  cost of goods sold and operating expense to the appraiser to assist in the valuation 
the appraisal considered three traditional approaches to valuation the cost approach  the market approach and the income approach 
the incomplete technology represents a mix of near and mid term prospects for the business and imparts a level of uncertainty to its prospects 
it is the nature of the business to be constantly developing enhanced products that offer improved storage capacity and performance 
a reasonable expectation of return on the incomplete technology would be higher than that of completed technology due to these inherent risks 
as a result  the earnings associated with incomplete technology were discounted at a rate of  and included as ipr d only that portion of the discounted revenues that had been completed at the acquisition date 
the valuation was based on the assumption that the estimated cost to complete all products under development  measured as of the acquisition date  would be approximately  the valuation approach also assumed that these products would generate revenues through the year the inability of micronet to complete this technology within the expected timeframes could materially impact future revenues and earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on micronet s business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalty income 
royalty income was million in  million in and million in the company s royalty income derives from patent licenses  and the company receives most of its royalty income from licenses with companies that manufacture consumer video products such as vcrs and camcorders and  in certain cases  professional video tape recorders 
during this period a growing portion of royalty income related to mm video recorders and camcorders 
in  the company negotiated its first license for use of certain of its patents in the manufacture of mm digital video recorders 
the company intends to pursue additional digital video recorder licensees 
the company is also assessing whether manufacturers of video games  dvd recorders and digital television receivers are using its patented technology 
there can be no assurance that the manufacturers of these products are utilizing the company s technology or  if used  whether the company will be able to negotiate license agreements with the manufacturers 
royalty income has historically fluctuated widely due to a number of factors that the company cannot predict or control such as the extent of use of the company s patented technology by third parties  the materiality of any nonrecurring royalties received as the result of negotiated settlements for products sold by manufacturers prior to entering into licensing agreements with the company  the extent which the company must pursue litigation in order to enforce its patents  and the ultimate success of its licensing and litigation activities 
the costs of patent litigation can be material  and the institution of patent enforcement litigation may also increase the risk of counterclaims alleging infringement by the company of patents held by third parties or seeking to invalidate patents held by the company 
see legal proceedings  above 
restructuring charges credits 
the company recorded a net restructuring charge in of million 
the charge included million in connection with the company s relocation of a portion of its dcrsi manufacturing operations from its redwood city  california facility to its colorado springs  colorado facility and concurrent workforce reduction  offset by a credit of million related to the termination of the lease of one of its buildings at its redwood city  california facility 
the million restructuring charge includes million for costs associated with the elimination of approximately us positions in engineering  manufacturing and administration  and million for transition  shipping and other costs 
at december   the company had paid and charged million against the liability accounts related to the termination benefits set up for the restructuring and terminated employees 
the relocation is expected to reduce operating costs by up to million annually 
these savings may be offset in whole or in part by increases in marketing expenses or other factors 
the company expects to implement the relocation in various phases through the first half of and may record additional charges in connection with these plans 
in connection with the company s restructuring  the company had accrued for the estimated future costs of vacated leased property and the closure of certain foreign subsidiaries 
in and  the company entered into transactions that reduced its anticipated obligations under several vacated leases 
in addition  certain expenses related to the closure of foreign subsidiaries were less than originally anticipated 
in  the amount of restructuring credit recognized in income is net of a reserve that was recorded to write off certain fixed assets and to provide for certain other costs totaling million in connection with the transfer of the keepered media program to a long term research and development project 
of the total million charge for keepered media  million related to the termination of eight us engineers and administrative staff  and all termination benefits were paid and charged against the liability accounts in early the remaining million charge for keepered media related to asset impairments and obligations on leased equipment which were paid or charged against the liability account in and as of december   the company had a remaining balance for accrued restructuring costs of million 
the company will continue to evaluate the amount of accrued restructuring costs on a quarterly basis  and the company may make additional adjustments in future periods if it determines that its actual obligations will differ significantly from the amounts accrued 
operating income loss 
the company incurred an operating loss of million in which included an operating loss by micronet of and reported operating income of million in and million in the operating loss in was primarily due to the decline in sales of ampex products  a charge of million for acquired in process research and development  a provision for restructuring of million and an actuarial valuation reserve of million  offset by reduced patent infringement litigation and other operating expenses from the comparable prior years 
during and in future years  the company expects to make strategic acquisitions and build in house capabilities relative to its internet video strategy 
these activities are expected to require significant expenditures that may result in consolidated net losses while the company is building its presence in internet video markets 
interest expense 
interest expense increased between the comparison periods due to the issuance of million of senior notes due and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock in january and july interest expense was not material in and million in in the first quarter of  the holders of the then outstanding zero coupon convertible notes with a principal amount at maturity of million converted the notes into approximately million shares of common stock 
also  in january  the mortgage on the real property in redwood city  california was repaid from the cash proceeds of the sale of such property 
amortization of debt financing costs 
these amounts reflect periodic amortization of financing costs over the remaining terms of the debt 
financing costs associated with the january issuance of the senior notes are being charged to expense over five years 
in  due to the conversion of the zero coupon notes and the repayment of the mortgage  the then remaining deferred financing costs were written off 
interest income 
interest income is earned on cash balances and short and long term investments 
in the company  pending application of the proceeds of the senior notes  had significantly higher investment balances compared to prior years  which resulted in higher interest income 
in and  interest income included imputed interest on the notes received in connection with the sale of the company s redwood city  california property in the notes were fully paid in other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from the company s foreign operations 
in  such amounts included a gain of million on the sale of the smaller of its two manufacturing facilities in colorado springs  colorado  offset by moving related expenditures of million at the redwood city  california facility 
provision for income taxes 
in the first quarter of  the company reversed million previously reserved in connection with disputed state income taxes for the prior years  following the favorable settlement of that dispute in march in the second and third quarter of  the company reversed and million  respectively  previously reserved in connection with the liquidation of its subsidiary in italy 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company was not required to include any material provision for us federal income tax in any of the last three fiscal years due to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and timing differences 
at december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes of million  expiring in the years through as a result of financing transactions that were completed in and  the company is limited in the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that can offset consolidated federal taxable income in a given year 
the company derives pretax foreign income from its international operations  which are conducted principally by its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  the company s royalty income is subject  in certain cases  to foreign tax withholding 
such income is taxed by foreign taxing authorities and the company s domestic interest and amortization expenses and operating loss carry forwards are not deductible in computing such foreign taxes 
the provisions for income taxes in and consist primarily of foreign income taxes and withholding taxes on royalty income 
net income 
the company reported net income of million in  million in  and million in liquidity and capital resources 
cash flow 
at december   the company had cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
at december   the company had cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
the increase in cash and short term investments and working capital in the period reflects the receipt of approximately million of net proceeds from the company s january and july issuance of its senior notes  offset primarily by an investment of million in working capital for micronet  increased inventories of million  decreased receivables of million and cash payments of accrued liabilities and accrued restructuring of million 
the company s operating activities utilized cash of million during  generated cash of million during and utilized cash of million in the increase in inventories over year end levels arose primarily due to lower sales levels than originally forecasted and buffer quantities held in anticipation of disruptions that may result from the phased relocation of manufacturing operations to its colorado springs facility 
the company expects that inventory levels will decline compared to the year end level as the relocation should be completed in the first half of any increased investment in inventories may expose the company to an increased risk of inventory write offs in future periods 
major items impacting net income in  which did not generate or use cash included a million favorable settlement of disputed state income taxes  million favorable resolution of prior years foreign tax contingencies  the recording of million for acquired in process research and development as a result of the acquisition of micronet and million for an actuarial revaluation reserve in connection with a supplemental retirement plan for prior executives 
subsequent to year end  the company announced that it had purchased minority investments in tv onthe web  inc tv on the web and alternative entertainment networks  inc aentv 
the company has options to acquire a majority interest in each of these businesses that expire at various dates through if ampex elected to exercise its option to acquire control of all of these internet video businesses in  together with its initial investments therein  it will have invested approximately million 
in addition  the company intends to build in house internet video production and distribution facilities during in los angeles and new york city 
there can be no assurance that the company will generate any revenues from its in house internet activities  and it estimates that while tv onthe web and aentv have historically generated modest profitability  these businesses will incur significant production and marketing expenses to build content and presence which will result in losses being incurred by them for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that it has sufficient working capital resources to fund the exercise of control options in affiliated companies and capital additions and operating expenditures of its in house internet activities throughout the company has available  through a subsidiary  a working capital facility that allows it to borrow or obtain letters of credit totaling million  based on eligible accounts receivable  through may at december   the company had borrowings outstanding of  and had letters of credit issued against the facility totaling million 
at december   the company had no material borrowings outstanding on this line and had letters of credit issued against the facility totaling million 
financing transactions 
in january  the company repaid the balance of the million mortgage loan on the redwood city  california property from a portion of the cash proceeds of the sale 
also  during  the company s convertible notes with an aggregate face amount at maturity of million were converted into approximately million shares of common stock  and warrants to purchase approximately million shares were exercised 
as at december   the company became required to redeem the  outstanding shares of its noncumulative preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation value of million the old preferred stock  to the extent of funds legally available therefor generally  the excess of the value of assets over liabilities at the redemption price of  per share 
pursuant to an agreement in the second quarter of  the company completed the redemption of the old preferred stock in exchange for the following securities a  shares of its class a common stock  par value per share the class a stock  b  shares of a new series of noncumulative convertible preferred stock  par value  with an aggregate liquidation value of million the convertible preferred stock  and c  shares of a new series of noncumulative redeemable preferred stock  par value per share  with an aggregate liquidation value of million the redeemable preferred stock 
each share of convertible preferred stock and redeemable preferred stock together  the new stock will entitle the holder thereof to receive noncumulative dividends at the rate of per annum  if declared by the company s board of directors 
each share of convertible preferred stock may be converted  at the option of the holder thereof  at a conversion price of per share  into shares of class a stock  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
subsequent to december   holders of  shares of convertible preferred stock exchanged their holdings for million shares of common stock 
beginning in june  the company will become obligated to redeem any remaining convertible preferred stock in quarterly installments through december beginning in june  the company will become obligated to redeem the redeemable preferred stock in quarterly installments through march in  the company will be required to redeem new stock having a liquidation preference of million 
the company will have the option to redeem the redeemable preferred stock at any time and the convertible preferred stock beginning in june  and will have the option to make mandatory redemption payments either in cash or in shares of common stock 
in the event that the company does not have sufficient funds legally available to make any mandatory redemption payment in cash  the company will be required to make such redemption payment by issuing shares of common stock 
shares of common stock issued to make any optional or mandatory redemption payments will be valued at the higher of or fair market value per share of common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the company issued million of its senior notes  together with warrants to purchase million shares of its class a common stock the class a stock 
the warrants are exercisable at per share at any time on or prior to march  at the end of the second quarter of  the company issued an additional million of senior notes 
as a result of the issuance of the senior notes  the company s total indebtedness and future debt service obligations have increased significantly from prior levels 
a portion of the net proceeds of the offering have been invested to repay short term debt and trade accounts payable of micronet  and the balance has been invested in short term government securities and other investments 
the yield on the company s investment portfolio is substantially lower than the interest charges on the senior notes 
the company has wide discretion as to how the debt proceeds may be invested  including for acquisitions of and investments in new businesses 
any such investments or acquisitions  if made  are not expected to pay a current return  which could require the company to fund debt service obligations on the senior notes out of its liquidity and cash flow from existing operations 
in order to minimize the difference between the interest the company currently receives on its investments and the interest payable on the senior notes  the company has invested a significant portion of the senior note proceeds in securities with higher yields  longer terms or lower credit quality  and the company may also engage in various transactions in derivative securities 
investments in any securities could expose the company to a risk of trading losses due to market or interest rate fluctuations or other factors that are not within the company s control 
the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains customary affirmative and negative restrictive covenants that limit  among other things  the incurrence of additional senior debt  the payment of dividends  the sale of assets and other actions by the company and certain restricted subsidiaries 
readiness for year many currently installed computer systems  software applications and other control devices collectively  systems are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
as the year approaches  these code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from those beginning with 
as a result  in just under one year the systems used by many companies may need to be modified to comply with year requirements 
ampex relies on its internal systems in operating and monitoring all major aspects of its business  including its manufacturing processes  engineering management controls  financial systems such as general ledger  accounts payable and payroll modules  customer services  infrastructure  embedded computer chips  networks and telecommunications equipment and products 
ampex also relies on the external systems of its suppliers and other organizations with which it does business 
the company has nearly completed its review of all of its products  as well as its internal systems  both it information technology systems and non it non information technology systems  and third party vendors relied on for the manufacture of the company s products 
to accomplish this the company  in early  established a year compliance committee to investigate and determine the compliance status of the company  to identify what needs to be done to achieve compliance if non compliance issues are identified  the cost of achieving compliance  and implementation plans to achieve compliance before january  the committee is headed by an executive officer of the company and membership includes representatives from all functional areas 
the committee has nearly completed its assessment and has determined that most systems are compliant and those that are not do not represent major efforts and are expected to be fully compliant by january  the status of the investigation is as follows system status manufacturing control and financial systems the financial software and the hardware that operates both the financial and manufacturing systems are currently non compliant 
the needed corrections are identified and now being implemented 
the systems are expected to be fully compliant by mid engineering systems three systems are non compliant document control system  electrical design system and mechanical design system 
the needed corrections are identified 
the systems are expected to be corrected and fully compliant by mid products offered for sale existing products are compliant 
former products that are no longer manufactured are generally compliant but these former products are not warranted to be year compliant 
production equipment all production and test equipment relied on by the company to manufacture products are either fully compliant  or in the case of several manufacturing test machines that are not compliant  do not need to be compliant to fully function 
third party vendors the company has sent questionnaires to third party vendors upon whom it relies for various parts  components and other product related material 
to date no material non compliance issues have been identified  but a number of vendors have not yet responded to our inquiry 
if  by june  we have not been able to determine the compliance status of any critical vendor we plan to develop contingency plans to find other sources of supply 
the company estimates the cost to be year compliant is less than the company believes that because of the nature of the corrections needed to make its systems compliant  there is minimal risk that the systems will be non compliant on january  accordingly  the company does not believe that it is necessary to expend its financial and other resources to develop contingency plans for these systems 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worse case scenario is that it will not be able to determine the compliance status of several critical vendors by june  if by mid it has not been able to make this determination  the company will develop contingency plans to arrange for alternate sources of materials 
the company s current insurance programs do not specifically exclude losses attributed to year non compliance  but these programs are subject to change as they are renewed for future periods 
despite the company s efforts thus far to address the year impact  the company cannot guarantee that all internal and external systems will be compliant  or that its business will not be materially adversely affected by any such non compliance 
recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for the company in fiscal year and will not require retroactive restatement of prior period financial statements 
the company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas on its financial statements  but the company believes there will not be a significant impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of its investments 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from the company s foreign subsidiaries were less than of total revenues 
international sales are made mostly from the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to the company s foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states
