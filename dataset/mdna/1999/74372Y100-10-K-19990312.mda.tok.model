general the company  a marketing solutions provider  brings a broad range of products  programs and services to consumers through direct mail  telesales and the internet 
damark uses targeted  information based strategies and makes offers to consumers for its own account as well as for the accounts of its corporate clients 
the company operates in two segments membership services and catalog retail 
in its membership services business  the company develops  markets and manages fee based programs that provide purchase price discounts and other benefits related to consumer needs in the areas of shopping  travel  hospitality  entertainment  health fitness  and household financial management 
the company s catalog retail business offers brand name  value priced merchandise in the categories of computers  home office  electronics  home decor  home improvement and sports fitness through a variety of catalog titles 
for  the company is focused on three operating priorities aggressively expanding its position in the membership services industry by increasing revenues  programs  client relationships and the share of clients served  improving the economic model of the catalog retail business to position it for future profitable growth in new customer segments and channels  and providing high impact member and client service in all business activities 
with respect to measuring its financial performance given the nature of its businesses  the company believes cash from operations is more useful in the near term than earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  net income or earnings per share for three reasons it is neutral with respect to revenue and expense recognition matters  it considers the changes in working capital that encompass approximately of the company s balance sheet  and it is used by many securities analysts to gauge operating performance when cash flow diverges significantly from net income 
the company uses the cash from operations metric as part of its internal performance measurement system to ensure that its employees are focused on the efficient use of capital as well as on operating profitability 
membership services membership services revenues net of cancellations and returns grew by to million during from million in during  net revenues increased by from million 
in  the company was able to grow revenues and new member acquisitions by entry into the client services channel  increased outbound telemarketing to its proprietary customer lists and expanding its suite of membership products 
in  revenue growth was due principally to increased catalog circulation compared to the prior year and implementation of the company s proprietary value delivery system resulting in increased conversions 
the company acquired million new memberships in  of which were obtained via the client services channel  indicating that the company is no longer solely dependent on catalog mailing growth to increase its membership 
costs and expenses incurred in the company s membership services business include direct membership solicitation costs  payments to external vendors to provide certain club benefits  customer service costs  commissions and success fees paid to clients for use of their customer lists  and general and administrative expenses 
the financial statements of the company s membership services segment also provide for inter company charges from catalog retail intended to approximate the costs the segment would pay an external client for name acquisition 
since independent parties did not negotiate such commissions  the charges do not reflect what a third party might receive in an actual business transaction 
consequently  financial information prepared as if the segments were companies operating independently without such allocation could differ materially from that presented 
such inter segment commissions totaled million  million and million in  and respectively 
segment costs and expenses increased as a percentage of net revenue to in as compared to in and in consequently  segment operating income decreased by between and to million compared to an increase of between and the primary reasons for the change in cost structure include increased use of outbound telemarketing to obtain members  commissions and success fees paid to clients and the opening of the company s inbound client services call center 
during  the segment provided million of net cash from operations  an increase of over the million supplied in the principal reason for the large increase was the growth in membership revenues 
catalog retail catalog retail revenues  net of discounts and product returns  were down by to million in from million in the decline was due to reduced offerings of longer duration installment billing programs  a purposeful shift away from an aggressive circulation strategy designed to grow new member acquisitions  and decreased response from certain historically profitable back end customer segments 
the company maintains a web site which generated million of marketed revenues in  an increase of over internet revenues 
the company s catalog retail segment provides certain discounts to preferred buyers club registered trademark and insiders registered trademark members 
due to response rates that are typically two to three times higher than those experienced in catalog retail s other customer segments and the consequent increase in advertising leverage  such discounts are allocated entirely to the catalog retail segment 
in  and  such discounts totaled million  million and million  respectively 
segment revenues could vary significantly in an arm s length transaction and could differ materially from the information presented 
in  given the opening of the client services channel as a source of membership acquisitions  the company moved emphasis away from growing catalog sales to recapturing margin 
the company s gross margin is influenced by changes in product sales mix and merchandise return rates  with sales of computer hardware having a particularly strong effect 
historically  the category has represented approximately to of the company s merchandise sales  yet it also carries the lowest gross margin percentage  which  due to market pressures  has been trending down 
in  the company s return rate decreased to of gross product sales compared to in and in  due principally to revisions made to the company s return policy and a decline in computer sales 
overall  the company s gross margin percentage on a post discount net shipped basis increased to in from in and in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net revenues increased to in from in and in the increase was due primarily to a decline in the ratio of shipped to marketed orders ship to gross  a decrease in advertising leverage and an increase in inbound teleservices costs 
ship to gross decreased primarily due to higher credit denials resulting from a more conservative credit policy and relatively weak response to back end catalogs decreased advertising cost leverage 
to address increased teleservices costs  the company implemented a new inbound call management plan in the fourth quarter 
during the same period  the company also reduced the size of its salaried staff by over and implemented other cost control and process improvement measures 
for  and  the company s catalog retail segment recorded operating losses of million  million and million  respectively 
however  due principally to reducing its investment in receivables and inventory  catalog retail generated million of net cash from operations in  compared to using million in and million in corporate during second quarter  the company incurred  in unusual expenses related to the temporary closure of its junction city call center as a result of a number of worker illnesses and resulting hospitalizations 
 of this incremental expense was not allocated to the company s operating segments 
during fourth quarter  in response to actual and projected net losses in prior and future periods  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company performed a review of its long lived assets for potential impairment 
as a result  the company recorded asset impairment charges of million related to goodwill and  related to furniture and fixtures and computer hardware 
further  in connection with its ongoing review of its year compliance status  million of internally developed software was identified as obsolete and without future value to the company 
finally  the company completed the renovation of its corporate headquarters during fourth quarter and wrote off  of unamortized leasehold improvements no longer in use 
all of these charges are included in the company s losses from operations 
the corporate segment also includes  of goodwill amortization in  and interest expense in and reflects increased borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility necessary to fund working capital requirements primarily related to its installment billing plans 
the company has limited its offerings of longer duration installment billing plans and  as a result  realized interest expense reductions during the second half of the company s effective tax rate was for and and for net loss income the company reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share for compared to net income of million  or per share for and million  or per share for per share results in each year were impacted by the repurchase of million   and  shares in   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  as compared to net cash used of million during the company was able to substantially reduce its investment in receivables and inventories as well as increase accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
a million reduction in receivables resulted primarily from limited offerings of longer duration installment billing plans during as compared to inventories declined by million and payables and accruals decreased by million as a consequence of the company s revised catalog retail strategy 
payables and accruals increased by million in the membership services business due principally to strong revenue growth 
the company s liquidity  as measured by its working capital net of cash and debt  was million at december   as compared to million at december  the company s current ratio was at december  as compared with at december  the decline in working capital and the current ratio reflect reductions of inventory levels and receivables  which exceeded the corresponding declines in current obligations 
capital expenditures during  the company made capital expenditures of million  as compared to million in capital expenditures in included costs associated with the opening of a new client services call center in brooklyn center  minnesota and improvements to the company s corporate headquarters 
capital expenditures in included costs associated with the opening of a call center in fayetteville  north carolina and the development and deployment of a proprietary value delivery system used during the order entry process 
the company intends to continue to invest in information technology to achieve operational efficiencies 
management anticipates that the company will make million to million of capital expenditures during financing the company obtained a new million revolving line of credit and letter of credit facility in to be used for general working capital and other corporate purposes 
in general  this facility provided an increased credit line  more favorable advance rates against pledged collateral  and greater financial flexibility than the company s prior arrangements for only a modest increase in interest rate 
borrowings outstanding under the line of credit are secured by certain assets of the company and bear interest  at the company s option  at the prime rate or libor plus spreads that vary based on excess availability  as defined 
at december   the company had million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding and was in compliance with its financial covenant under the agreement 
during  cash was used principally to retire short term debt of million compared to increased borrowings of million in and million in during  and  the company repurchased shares of its common stock at aggregate costs of million   and million  respectively 
repurchased shares were acquired under a series of programs authorized by the company s board of directors the board that included private and open market transactions 
during third quarter  the board authorized a two million share open market repurchase program  and at december   authorization to purchase approximately  shares remained under this program 
the company anticipates that cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under its current credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital expenditures during year compliance the company utilizes both information technology it and non it systems that will likely be affected by the date change in the year the company has performed an extensive review of its systems  including assessing the affect of  and developing plans directed at  achieving compliance 
in addition  the company has and will be investing resources dedicated to achieving compliance 
the company s primary objective with respect to such compliance is to mitigate the risk of a significant business interruption 
progress toward achieving compliance is reported on a regular basis to management and the board 
to date  the company has assessed its exposure to the issue and ascertained areas of potential risk 
the company has exercised its best efforts to identify and remedy any potential year exposures within its internal systems and will continue to do so 
based on the reviews and analysis performed to date  the company believes that the risk of significant non compliance in its internal it systems is minimal since a majority have been developed or modified within the last five years 
the company has also identified and corresponded with key vendors and other third parties whose inability to achieve compliance in a timely fashion would negatively impact or disrupt operations 
the company believes that failure by third parties to achieve compliance presents the largest risk of a significant business interruption 
key services provided to the company by external parties  include  but are not limited to  telecommunications  credit processing  printing  funds transfer and utilities 
in addition  while the company values its relationships with its key vendors  it is identifying secondary vendors in the event that certain of its business partners are delayed in achieving compliance 
the company has incurred operating and capital expenses related to the evaluation and implementation of solutions to resolve the year issue and expects certain expenditures to continue through in accordance with the company s financial policies  software and hardware maintenance or modification costs are expensed as incurred 
the costs of new hardware and software assets that primarily provide enhanced functionality beyond achieving compliance are capitalized and amortized over their respective useful lives 
the company anticipates total expenditures related to the issue of approximately million  of which million has been incurred to date in addition to million of software written off in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the costs of addressing the year issue are not expected to materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  the company s current estimates of the amount of time and cost necessary to modify and test its it and non it systems for compliance are based upon assumptions regarding future events 
new developments may occur that could affect such estimates and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not be materially higher than those anticipated 
seasonality like most retailing businesses  the company s catalog retail segment is subject to significant seasonal variations in consumer demand 
historically  the company s net retail revenues have been the largest during the fourth quarter and a significant portion of its annual earnings have been realized during that period 
the company s annual operating results may be affected by holiday spending patterns  as well as the timing and effectiveness of catalog mailings and general economic and other conditions 
in anticipation of its peak season  the company hires additional flex time employees in its call centers and order processing and distribution areas  increases its merchandise inventories and incurs significant catalog production and mailing costs 
the company s annual operating results could be adversely affected if  among other factors  the company s revenues were to be substantially below seasonal expectations during the fourth quarter  or if a sufficient number of qualified employees would not be available on a flex time or other non permanent basis 
inflation excluding increases in postage and paper costs  inflation has not had  and the company does not expect it to have  a material impact on operating results 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
pending securities and exchange commission interpretation currently  when any trial period has elapsed  membership revenues with respect to clubs for which the company has an ongoing obligation to provide benefits are recorded on the balance sheet net of direct solicitation costs and are amortized into income over the membership period  generally months  in accordance with what it believes to be generally accepted accounting principles 
in august  the securities and exchange commission sec required another company in the membership services industry to defer the recognition of revenue from the sale of memberships until the expiration of the period during which a full refund is offered and to record the expenses of soliciting memberships as incurred rather than deferring and recognizing such over the membership period 
in september  the sec issued a press release stating that the sec will formulate and augment new and existing accounting rules and interpretations covering revenue recognition  restructuring reserves  materiality  and disclosure for all publicly traded companies 
the timing of issuance of such guidelines as well as the specific requirements of the final sec interpretation is uncertain and  therefore  the impact such guidance will have on the company s current accounting practices cannot be quantified 
however  if the company is required to change its current accounting treatment for revenue and expense recognition  it would have a material non cash impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
governmental regulations a supreme court decision confirmed that the commerce clause of the united states constitution prevents a state from requiring the collection of its use tax by a mail order company unless the company has a physical presence in the state 
however  there continues to be uncertainty due to inconsistent application of the supreme court decision by state and federal courts 
the company attempts to conduct its operations in compliance with its interpretation of the applicable legal standard  but there can be no assurance that such compliance will not be challenged 
from time to time the company has received notices and inquiries from states with respect to collection of use taxes for sales to residents of these states 
the company currently collects sales tax and pays state income tax where it has a physical presence 
the company has not collected sales tax or paid income taxes in other states  nor has it established significant reserves for the payment of such taxes 
management believes that the amount of any income tax the company might ultimately be required to pay for prior periods would not materially and adversely affect the company s business  consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
recently issued accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  effective for fiscal years beginning after june   establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
management believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations
