item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview strong domestic sales up percent from the prior year helped offset a substantial decline in international detector sales because of the poor russian economy 
domestic sales were driven by sales of new microtalk two way radios and band radar detectors 
sales of higher margin new products led to a significant improvement in gross margin  which hit its highest level in the s 
the increase in gross margin and a one time income tax benefit of million resulted in net income of million for excluding the effects of the income tax benefit and a one time gain of million on the sale of a building  net income per diluted share increased percent in the tax benefit was due to the elimination of the company s deferred tax valuation allowance 
this valuation allowance had substantially offset the company s net deferred tax asset  a significant portion of which related to the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the continued positive trend in earnings and the successful launch of the company s new products  management determined that this valuation allowance was no longer needed because the company expects to fully utilize its remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets  arising from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting  to offset future taxable income 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of million 
results of operations compared to net income for increased to million or per diluted share from million or per diluted share in included in net income for and were a million income tax benefit and a million one time gain on the sale of a building  respectively 
excluding the tax benefit and the prior year s one time gain  net income and net income per diluted share for increased  or percent and or per cent  respectively 
net sales for remained relatively flat at million compared to million in however  domestic sales  boosted by increased retail distri bution and strong demand for the new microtalk frs two way radios and the com pany s proprietary band radar detectors  were up percent from this helped offset a million drop in international sales  primarily because of lower sales of radar detectors into russia as a result of that country s ongoing severe economic problems 
strong sales of frs two way radios and domestic radar detectors were partially offset by an million decline in sales of radar detectors into russia be cause of that country s ongoing economic problems 
frs two way radio sales benefitted from the new microtalk line  which the company began shipping in september this new line has helped the company add several new customers  expand placement among existing major retail accounts and add sporting goods and office supply as new channels of distribution 
the increase in domestic radar detector sales was due to the popularity of the company s proprietary six band technology 
these new models  which began shipping at the end of the first quarter of  enabled the company to achieve steady market share gains during the year 
sales of cordless telephones decreased million  or percent 
this decline reflected lower sales of channel products as the company shifts its business to the new line of mhz cordless telephones  which it began shipping in the third quarter of gross margin for improved to percent from percent in primarily due to a greater portion of higher margin soundtracker cb radios  microtalk two way radios and band radar detectors in the sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million during and  as a percentage of net sales  increased to percent from per cent in much of the increase was due to higher selling and marketing costs 
one reason for the increase was a shift in sales mix in to more domestic sales  which have much higher selling expenses associated with them compared to the selling expenses associated with international sales 
also  selling and marketing expenses increased as the company continued to invest significantly in new product development  retail account expansion and distri bution channel gains 
these investments have resulted in increased placement of cobra products as well as gross margin improvement 
also contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was consulting expense incurred to make the company s data processing systems year compliant and higher legal and related costs incurred to register and protect the company s trademarks world wide 
offsetting some of the increase was the fact that selling  general and administrative expense included a charge of million to reduce advertising credits to their net realizable value 
interest expense for decreased slightly to million from million  primarily due to a more favorable banking agreement  entered into in early  and lower overall interest rates 
in  the company sold a building that was not needed for operations and was being leased to an outside party for approximately million  resulting in a one time gain of million 
other income was  in compared to other expense of  in the net favorable change was due to decreased bank fees resulting from the new bank agreement mentioned above 
in the company recorded an income tax benefit of million 
the tax benefit was due to the elimination of the company s deferred tax valuation allowance 
this valuation allowance had substantially offset the company s net deferred tax asset  a significant portion of which related to the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
prior to  the company had a history of net losses resulting in a significant net deferred tax asset and a corresponding valuation allowance 
under sfas no 
 a history of operating losses in recent years generally requires recognition of such an allowance 
accordingly  the company recorded a valuation allowance for substantially all of the net deferred tax asset 
however  sfas no 
requires management to periodically access the need for a valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the continued positive trend in earnings and the successful launch of the company s new products  management concluded that there was no need for a valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings 
in the future  the company will report a tax provision since the deferred tax valuation allowance no longer exists to offset any tax expense 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of million 
compared to net income for increased to million from  in included in net income for was a million gain on the sale of a building during the third quarter that the company did not need for its operations and was leasing to an outside party 
net income  excluding the gain on the sale of the building  increased million to million in from  in net sales increased million  or percent  to million from million in selling  general and administrative expense increased to million from million  but  as a percentage of net sales  remained substantially unchanged at percent 
sales of cb radios increased percent mainly because of strong demand for radios with the company s exclusive  patent pending soundtracker technology  introduced early in the year 
additionally  an all new radar detector lineup helped drive sales volume in the us  while internationally the company capitalized on the strong demand in russia for radar detectors 
in total  international sales  which consisted principally of radar detector sales increased million in sales of channel cordless phones and integrated cordless phone answering systems decreased million because of lower sales to several large retail customers 
also contributing to the sales decrease was lower sales of factory reconditioned products as a result of agreements with some of the company s vendors that allow product returned from the company s customers to be returned to the vendor for partial credit towards future purchases 
prior to these agreements  which were entered into in  the company repaired and resold this returned merchandise as factory reconditioned product 
the company also restricted expanding distribution for its channel cordless phones as it sought to de emphasize this product line in favor of the rapidly growing mhz segment which the company introduced in the fall of with several mhz cordless phone models 
gross margin for increased to from in primarily due to an improvement in sales mix of higher margin cb and radar detector products 
sales of these products increased as a percentage of total sales from per cent in to approximately in in addition  gross margin on radar detectors increased due to the new radar detector lineup  which in cluded lower cost models that replaced higher cost models 
also contributing to the gross margin improvement was lower repair costs on returned products  which declined because of return to vendor agreements discussed above 
partially offsetting the favorable impact of these items was  of increased air freight expense mainly to satisfy the strong demand for cb radios with the soundtracker system 
normally the company uses significantly less expensive ocean freight to import its products 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million during and  as a percentage of net sales  remained relatively unchanged from sales and marketing expenses increased due to higher variable expenses resulting from the increase in sales volume  the addition of a senior vice president of marketing and sales  a newly created position  in february  and increased promotional spending mainly to promote the new soundtracker technology 
in addition  higher bonus and bad debt expense in also contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
bad debt expense increased because of the bankruptcy of a small customer and a potential preference payment issue for a prior year s bankruptcy 
in addition  prior year s bad debt expense reflected a favorable reserve adjust ment because of improvement in the quality of the receivable portfolio and favorable collections experience 
as in  included a charge for the write down of advertising barter credits to estimated net realizable value amounting to million in compared to a charge of million in interest expense for decreased to million from million 
debt levels declined due to lower average inventory and receivable levels 
the company sold a building  which was not needed for operations and was being leased to an outside party  in the third quarter of for approximately million 
the sale resulted in a million gain 
other expense was  in compared to other income of  in in there was a gain of  from a suit against a former distributor for violation of a licensing agreement and  of royalty income from safety alert licensing agreements  offset by a  writedown of a building related to a discontinued operation 
liquidity and capital resources on february   the company entered into a new million secured credit agreement with two financial institutions for a three year revolving credit facility  replacing an existing million credit agreement 
loans outstand ing under the new agreement bear interest  at the company s option  at the prime rate or libor plus percent 
additionally  the new agreement provides for higher advance rates on eligible inventory and receivables and eliminates the percent per annum charge that the company was obligated to pay on its average outstanding balance of letters of credit under the previously exist ing agreement 
on october   the company and its lenders signed an amendment increasing the credit line from million dollars to million 
this increase reflected a separate line of credit under which borrowings are secured by the cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies owned by the company 
to date  there have been no borrowings under this amendment  which expires on august  the credit agreement specifies that the company may not pay cash dividends and contains a material adverse change clause  which  under certain circumstances  could accelerate the payment of the debt 
the company classifies the debt as short term for financial reporting purposes 
at december   the company had approximately million available under the credit line 
net cash flows used by operating activities were million for the year ended december  operating cash flows were generated principally from net income of million  depreciation of million and a million reduction in inventories  offset by the elimination of the income tax valua tion allowance of million  an million increase in accounts receivable  and a million increase in other assets 
receivables increased compared to the prior year because of higher fourth quarter sales volume and an overall increase in average payment terms 
inventories decreased mainly because of the strong fourth quarter sales and lower inventories of channel phone products  which are being phased out to make way for the new mhz products 
accrued liabilities decreased due to lower product warranty costs as a result of the lower mix of channel products and decreased accrued salaries and commissions due to a lower bonus accrual 
investing activities required cash of million in  principally for the purchase of tooling and equipment and an increase in the cash surrender value of officers life insurance 
financing activities provided cash flows of million in  reflecting changes in the company s borrowing requirements under its line of credit agreement  offset by the repurchase of  shares of company common stock for an aggregate cost of  in august  the company s board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
at december   the company had no material commitments  other than approximately million in outstanding purchase orders for products compared with million at the end of the prior year 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and from borrowings under its credit agreement will be sufficient in to fund its working capital needs 
in addition  the majority of any taxable income in and the forseeable future will be offset by net operating loss carryforwards that totaled million at december  until the company has utilized its net operating loss carryforwards  the cash payment of federal income taxes will be minimal 
year the company initiated the process of preparing its computer systems and applications for the year in this process primarily involved two parts replacing certain company hardware and modifying software maintained by the company  as well as inquiring into the year compliance of the company s major customers and vendors 
in february  the replacement of hardware and software modifications were completed by an outside consulting firm 
the company has tested the hardware and modified software for year compliance 
the company believes its hardware and software are year compliant  but it will continue testing during the company has also queried all major customers and vendors as to their preparedness 
the responses received to date indicate that the company s major customers and vendors are or will be year compliant by year end 
the final total cost to the company of these year compliance activities is approximately  and is not expected to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
the failure to correct a year problem could interrupt  or result in a failure of  normal business operations and consequently materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
while the company believes its own hardware and software are year compliant  the year readiness of the company s customers and vendors is inherently uncertain and beyond the company s control 
accordingly  the company cannot determine at this time whether the consequences of year interruptions or failures will materially affect the company s financial position or results of opera tions 
the company has not developed formal contingency plans to date 
however  as described under item business in this report  the company has a network of suppliers and the company does not enter into long term supply contracts 
the company believes that  if necessary  other suppliers could be found 
as stated above  customer responses to company inquiries indicate that the company s major customers are or will be year compliant by year end 
in the event a major customer is not year compliant  the company believes that such non compliance is unlikely to materially affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item a market risk and financial instruments the company is subject to market risk associated principally with changes in interest rates 
interest rate exposure is principally limited to the million of debt of the company outstanding at december  the debt is priced at interest rates that float with the market  which therefore mini mizes interest rate exposure 
a basis point movement in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would result in an approximately  increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows 
the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for trading or other purposes 
the company s suppliers are located in foreign countries  principally in the far east  and the company made approximately of its sales outside the united states in  however  the company minimizes its foreign currency exchange rate risk by conducting all of its transactions in us dollars
