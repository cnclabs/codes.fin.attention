item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s revenue is derived from two sources software license fees and services revenue 
license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under license agreements  which typically have a five year term  and may be extended at the customer s option for an additional fixed period 
such license agreements are generally non cancellable  although some may be terminated by the customer for a fee prior to the expiration of the initial term  but after a minimum specified period 
the company s license agreements generally provide for annual license fee increases the inflation adjustments based on recognized inflation indexes 
license revenue is generally recognized upon the delivery and acceptance of the licensed software in accordance with the applicable license agreement 
the fair value of all undelivered elements must be deferred at the time of license revenue recognition 
in the case of license agreement renewals or extensions  revenue is recognized upon execution of the renewal or the extension 
the inflation adjustments are recognized ratably over the periods to which they apply 
the amount of software license revenue recognized is generally equal to the present value of the license payments due during the minimum initial or renewal term  plus the present value of any early termination fee 
for the three months ended march   the discount rate for purposes of the present value calculation was  for the nine months ended december   such discount rate was 
commencing with the three months ended march   the company established the discount rate quarterly as a function of the company s current marginal borrowing rate 
in the discount rate for purposes of the present value calculation was and for the nine months ended september   the discount rate for purposes of the present value calculation was 
commencing with the three months ended december   the company established the discount rate monthly as a function of the company s current marginal borrowing rate  reduced  with respect to licenses which provide for inflation adjustments  by  reflecting the company s estimate of future inflation adjustments during the minimum license term 
in the fourth quarter of  the discount rate for purposes of the present value calculation were in october  in november and in december 
the imputed interest portion of the license fees  which is reported as license interest income in the company s consolidated statements of income  is recognized over the term 
to date  a majority of the company s software licenses have been renewed upon expiration 
the company s services revenue is comprised of fees for implementation  consulting  maintenance and training services 
software license customers are offered the ability to enter into a maintenance contract requiring the customer to pay a monthly maintenance fee over the term of the related license agreement typically equal to approximately of the license fee 
maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
the company s software implementation agreements typically require the company to provide a specified level of implementation services for a specified fee  typically with additional implementation services available at an hourly rate 
implementation fees are often recognized as performed or upon the achievement of specified milestones 
the company generally recognizes implementation as well as consulting and training fees as the services are provided 
the company s international revenues have fluctuated considerably in the past due to the fact that such revenues have been largely attributable to a small number of product acceptances during a given period 
in  international revenues increased to as a result of renewal of prior agreements and acceptances of new product for new customers 
in  international revenues increased to million as a result of new product acceptances and license renewals in europe  canada and mexico 
in  international revenues increased to million as a result of new customers in europe 
most of the company s contracts are denominated in u 
s dollars 
the company expects that in the future more of its contracts may be denominated in foreign currencies 
the company has not experienced any significant foreign exchange gains or losses  and the company does not expect that foreign currency fluctuations will significantly affect its financial position or results from operations 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant seasonality and lack of predictable revenues 
historically  the company has recognized a greater percentage of its revenue in its third and fourth quarters than in its first and second quarters due to the company s sales commission structure and the impact of that structure on the timing of product acceptances and license renewals by customers 
this pattern is reinforced by the company s maintenance contracts  which generally entitle customers to  among other things  a fixed number of free consulting hours per calendar year 
once the annual allotment of free consulting hours is exhausted  customers pay for additional services on a hourly basis 
the timing of license revenues is directly related to the completion of implementation services and acceptance of the licensed software by the customer  the timing of which has proven to be difficult to predict accurately 
on april   the company restated its consolidated financial statements for each of the three unaudited quarters in the nine month period ended september  the restatements reflected revenue adjustments as a result of a change in the timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts 
also included in the restated consolidated financial statements are operating expenses  including a provision for bad debts not previously recorded by the company and the recording of certain other expenses and reserves 
on october   the company publicly announced its preliminary  unaudited results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended september  subsequently  based on information that had not previously come to the attention of the company or its external auditors  the company determined that it may not have accounted properly for certain revenue transactions 
as a result  the company  with the assistance of its independent auditors  conducted a comprehensive review of those transactions and others relating to the three months ended september  and other periods in and based on such review  the company concluded that it was necessary to revise its previously disclosed preliminary  unaudited results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended september  and to restate its unaudited interim financial statements for the first and second quarters of each of and the revenue changes are principally reversals of license and service revenue arising from the inability to estimate fair value of undelivered elements implementation services granted in connection with software license and implementation service arrangements  issues surrounding the timing of delivery or acceptance of licensed software  certain project milestones not being completed and improper or delayed billings 
the revenue changes also reflect an increase in revenue reserves 
in the opinion of management  all material adjustments necessary to correct the consolidated financial statements have been recorded

the company s accounts receivable increased due to larger sales volume and deterioration in the age of the accounts receivable 
the increase of cash used in operating activities was also attributable to the costs associated with the significant increase in new employees during the year ended december   some of whom  especially those in the company s sales and client services groups  require months of training and experience before they are able to generate revenue 
additionally  the company s method of licensing its software over a month period with payments made in monthly installments over the license term results in significant cash utilization during periods of rapid growth because a substantial portion of the associated expenses are incurred prior to the commencement of the license term 
the company is currently taking a number of steps to reduce the amount of cash used in operating activities  including improving billings practices in order to reduce the time between when services are performed and when such services are billed  intensifying collection efforts on past due accounts  exploring the possible securitization of license receivables  hiring new employees on a more selective basis and implementing more stringent cost controls  including reducing unnecessary personnel

effect of year issues 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information or other date changes could generate erroneous data or fail 
pegasystems customers rely on date sensitive operations to calculate internal data and to service their customers 
in addition  the company also uses other companies products as part of market offerings and for internal use  these programs may also be affected by the issue 
year readiness issues may negatively affect the purchasing patterns of existing and potential customers 
many organizations are spending significant amounts and rededicating personnel to correct or patch their current systems to achieve year readiness 
thus  fewer funds may be available to purchase the company s products 
also  the issue may divert customers and potential customers time  attention  and resources away from those projects which typically lead to purchases of products or services 
the company does not believe that there is any practical way to ascertain the extent of  and has no plans to address problems associated with  any such reduction in purchasing resources of its customers 
any such reduction could  however  result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
pegasystems has designed and tested current versions of its products to be consistent with use after year however  some customers are using earlier product versions 
in addition the company s products are generally integrated with the systems and products of its customers developed by other vendors 
year problems in these systems and products might significantly limit the ability of the company s customers to realize the intended benefit offered by the company s products 
the company may in the future be subject to claims based on year problems in others products or issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system 
although the company has not been involved in any litigation or proceeding to date involving its products or services related to year issues  there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liabilities of the company for year related damages could have a material adverse effect on the company business  operating results and financial condition 
the company also relies on certain computer technology and software that it licenses form third parties  including software that is integrated with the company s products 
these programs may also present year problems 
although the company has not experienced any significant product claims to date  there can be no assurance that unanticipated errors or defects will not result in product liability or other claims in the future 
failure of third party software comprising any part of the company s systems to operate properly with regard to year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to address associated problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has adopted standard industry practices to prepare for the effect of the upcoming date change on internal data and information technology systems such as communications  development  accounting  billing  and other systems 
the company s year internal readiness program primarily covers taking inventory of hardware  software and embedded systems  assessing business and customer satisfaction risks associated with such systems  creating action plans to address known risks  executing and monitoring action plans  and contingency planning 
pegasystems expects to substantially complete year readiness preparations by the end of the second quarter of with respect to core business systems 
although the company does not believe that it will incur any material costs or experience material disruptions in its business associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include i corruption of data contained in internal information systems  ii hardware failure  and iii the failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies and other third parties eg  electricity  phone service  water transport  internet services  etc the company is in the process of completing contingency planning for high risk areas such as accounting  payroll  and invoicing billing systems at this time and has commenced contingency planning relating to other areas 
the company expects contingency plans to include  among other things  manual work arounds for software and hardware failures  as well as substitution of systems  if necessary 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results to date  and the company does not expect it to have a significant impact in the future 
the company s license and maintenance fees are typically subject to annual increases based on recognized inflation indexes 
significant customers in  the company had one customer that accounted for of the company s consolidated revenue 
in  the company had two customers that accounted for and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenue 
in  the company had three customers that accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenue

although the company s sales denominated in foreign currencies in were not material  there can be no assurance that such sales will not be material in the future and that there will not be increases in the value of the dollar against such currencies that will reduce the dollar return to the company on the sale of its products in such foreign currencies
