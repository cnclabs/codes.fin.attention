the company utilized a hiring delay  redeployment  discretionary spending controls  a voluntary leave program and other cost containment efforts  which  when coupled with the variable nature of bonus and incentive compensation programs  enabled achievement of the results without sacrificing long term strategic efforts or jeopardizing its relations with employee shareholders 
in addition  the provision for income taxes benefited from the favorable resolution of income tax litigation dating back to  which contributed to a reduced effective tax rate for and resulted in interest income of million

   steelcase strafor worldwide net sales 
   steelcase strafor net sales have been adjusted from amounts previously reported in order to conform the classifications of sales deductions with those reflected in the company s consolidated net sales 
these reclassifications were identified in connection with the company s april  acquisition of strafor facom s interest in steelcase strafor 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in local currency  steelcase strafor net sales increased in and in worldwide net sales include  on a pro forma basis  the company s consolidated net sales plus those of its unconsolidated european joint venture  steelcase strafor 
net sales of all other unconsolidated joint ventures and dealer transitions are not material 
during  the company  along with the us office furniture industry overall  experienced a slowdown in its growth 
for and  the company s consolidated net sales grew faster than the industry  increasing by and  respectively 
however  during consolidated net sales were essentially flat  lagging us industry growth  which as reported by the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma approximated for the calendar year ended december  pro forma worldwide net sales  which reflect steelcase strafor as if the joint venture were consolidated  generally followed the same trend line as consolidated net sales 
however  within europe  steelcase strafor experienced a greater growth rate over the three year period in local currency due to a strengthening economy and the success of new product introductions 
the growth has been spread across most key markets  as well as eastern europe and other new markets that the joint venture has pursued in the past three years 
domestic us only 
the company s largest market  the domestic us  includes the following steelcase operations steel  the steelcase design partnership sdp  turnstone  steelcase wood and revest 
while substantially all us net sales are processed and serviced through the dealer network  the company segregates dealer sales between those contracted solely by its dealers its primary us distribution channel  and those contracted directly by the company typically large corporate account business 
fluctuations within the different operations and distribution channels have resulted in us net sales growth rates of  and in  and  respectively 
for  and  sales contracted solely by the company s dealers grew by approximately six percent  percent and percent  respectively 
large corporate account business in the same periods experienced double digit growth in and  and a double digit decline in other distribution channels include government  education and institution  and other sectors  none of which significantly impacted us growth trends in the reported periods 
us net sales growth in and resulted primarily from increases in unit sales across most product categories reflecting strong industry fundamentals 
in  the industry began to soften due to the financial volatility in asian and latin american markets  which  along with a high level of domestic merger and acquisition activity within the us fortune companies  contributed to the double digit decline in the company s large corporate account business channel 
management believes that the uncertainties posed by these global economics significantly influenced corporate capital spending decisions  thereby causing delays of anticipated projects throughout the course of while some of these projects are beginning to resurface during the current year  many remain delayed  possibly due to ongoing global economic uncertainty and general corporate concern over the potential impact of year issues and their disruption on the business world 
in and  the company s steel operations  which include its primary product lines office furniture systems  seating  storage solutions  interior architectural products  and desks and casegoods  benefited from strong industry fundamentals  resulting in growth in unit sales across most product categories 
in  as the industry softened  these product categories were impacted by the deferred spending actions within the company s large corporate account business  resulting in declines across the same product categories that benefited from a strong industry in and however  in  the company continued to experience double digit growth in all other us operations 
acquisitions did not have a material impact on us net sales for any of the reported periods 
international and canada 
in and  the international and canadian segment experienced growth of and  respectively  due to strong export sales to both latin america and the middle east in both years  office furniture industry growth in canada in and acquisitions in in  the international and canadian segment decreased due to several factors including first  although canadian net sales in local currency increased for the year  unfavorable exchange rates entirely offset the growth  second  the company experienced a reduction in export projects to latin america and flat sales in asia due to local economic conditions  and third  the company s japanese subsidiary was reorganized during the third quarter of and as a result now receives royalty income instead of recording the related net sales 
services and other businesses 
services and other businesses  which more than doubled in  were virtually flat in and declined by in  were impacted by an acquisition at the beginning of and the disposal of a product line and distributor within the company s marine business at the end of the third quarter of gross profit the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly in to from in  after increasing in and these improvements reflect increased overhead absorption through increased sales and the impact of a cost reduction program  initiated in  designed to improve raw materials sourcing  contain costs and rationalize facilities 
in the first two years of the cost reduction program  the company was able to reap significant benefits by improving raw materials sourcing  leveraging the net sales growth by simultaneously containing costs and beginning to streamline manufacturing processes by culling low volume surface materials  such as laminates  fabrics and paints 
in and  however  efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiencies began to require upfront commitment of expenses and capital  replacement of various manufacturing equipment  changes in significant processes and consolidation of certain facilities 
at the same time  the company has been in the midst of launching the largest new product portfolio in its history  experiencing expected disruptions and various inefficiencies 
as a result  the benefits to be realized by most of the cost reduction efforts made in and are expected to occur in future periods  in some cases simply as time passes  but in others only as the company s steel operations experience unit sales growth 
during the three year period  pricing has not had a significant impact on gross margins  however  the company continues to experience pressure on its discounts  especially as the industry softened during the current year 
in prior years  the company reported identifiable costs associated with furniture distribution process changes  the restructuring and disposition of a non furniture related manufacturing facility  certain manufacturing equipment write offs and other matters  which aggregated million for and million for management believes that costs similar to have been incurred during  including the impacts of launching new products and the consolidation of the company s chair plants 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in and in  reflecting management s cost containment and resource redeployment efforts 
during the three year period  investments in information systems and new product research  development and launch have been significant and increasing 
however  the company has been focused on redeployment of resources in support of its strategic initiatives and therefore has been able to improve its operating expense leverage 
in addition  the structure of the company s management incentive plan  which is predominantly based on growth in the company s performance  contributed to the current year s achievement of through a reduction in management bonuses 
in  the company reported that selling  general and administrative costs included aggregate costs of million relating to the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary  the relocation of a showroom facility and the initial public offering and receipt by the company of a net litigation settlement in the amount of million

other income  net is expected to be impacted in fiscal due to the acquisitions referenced above  including the remaining of steelcase strafor  which was financed through cash and short term borrowings that the company expects to refinance in the first half of fiscal as it finalizes its borrowing structure 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes the effective tax rate approximated in  in and in during  the provision for income taxes benefited from the favorable resolution of income tax litigation dating back to  primarily related to investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation on the company s corporate development center 
the resolution of these matters contributed to a reduced effective tax rate for and resulted in interest income of million 
these tax matters increased consolidated net income by million  or per share basic and diluted 
the effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to the reduced level of income as a result of patent litigation expenses 
the company s effective income tax rate is expected to increase as a result of the acquisition and consolidation of steelcase strafor  due to higher tax rates throughout most of europe and the recording of non deductible goodwill

year readiness the company is actively engaged in replacing or modifying all business software applications as well as manufacturing and other equipment with embedded technology that could fail or generate erroneous results by or at the year year issues  an issue affecting steelcase inc and most other companies 
the company intends that its business application systems  technical infrastructure components  and manufacturing equipment be year ready by the end of june of however  management views the process of assessing and remediating year issues as an ongoing process which will require continued focus  testing and verification throughout calendar the company s year readiness effort is comprised of five phases defined below awareness activities to ensure management and all affected employees are aware that year issues exist 
assessment includes the inventory of all potentially affected hardware  software  and embedded technology equipment  along with a determination as to whether or not they may be impacted by the year issues 
remediation repairs  replacement  and or modifications to eliminate the year issues in hardware  software or equipment 
testing testing of the hardware  software or equipment to determine if the remediation was successful 
implementation moving the hardware  software or equipment from a test status or test location to production usage 
although the company s individual business units  majority owned subsidiaries and unconsolidated joint ventures may be individually at different stages of readiness  the following comments summarize steelcase inc s state of readiness with respect to year issues 
since  the company has been selectively replacing business software applications with sap  a year compliant comprehensive information management system 
this project is part of a strategic business plan to upgrade the overall capabilities of the company s business application systems 
costs to date specifically to address year issues  separate from sap implementations  have approximated million 
future costs anticipated to remedy year issues have been budgeted and are not expected to exceed an additional million 
further  various individual business units  majority owned subsidiaries and unconsolidated joint ventures are engaged in the implementation of year compliant enterprise software systems 
in late  the company began its efforts to address those business applications which might not be replaced in time with equivalent sap systems by engaging a third party specializing in the modification of business software applications 
the engagement lasted through december  at which time the majority of remediation efforts related to those business software applications were substantially complete 
since that time  the company has been testing those business software applications and as of february  had substantially completed the initial testing of those software applications 
in december  the company established a program management office pmo  reporting to the chief information officer of the company 
the pmo has the responsibility to provide oversight for the company s year readiness program that consists of the five phases noted above 
these five phases will be employed for the following areas business application software  manufacturing and other equipment with embedded chip technology  and evaluation and due diligence with respect to the company s supply chain and distribution channel 
the pmo is also responsible for periodic status reporting to the company s executive management and to the board of directors 
in addition  the year pmo is providing oversight for the development and execution of contingency and business continuity planning efforts  which have begun in a number of the company s business units 
as of february   the company had completed the assessment phase for the majority of its manufacturing facilities having embedded technology 
the assessment resulted in minimal findings of non compliance 
the company s manufacturing equipment is generally year ready and is not anticipated to require significant reprogramming or replacement 
remediation and testing of the equipment identified as needing some reprogramming or replacement is expected to be substantially complete by mid calendar year the company initiated formal communications with production suppliers in january and with its dealer network in may  inquiring as to their state of readiness 
as of february   over  suppliers have been contacted  and from the responses received to date  the company believes that its supply chain partners are actively seeking to become year ready 
the company has initiated further in depth analyses of the readiness of approximately key suppliers 
in addition  as of february   a majority of the dealers  both international and domestic  had responded  mostly with favorable self assessment ratings 
many governmental agencies  however  may not be year compliant 
it is difficult for steelcase inc and most other companies to assess the likelihood  or the impact  if any  on their businesses  of such entities failure to be year compliant 
the company presently believes that  upon completion of its current plans for remediation of its business software applications as well as manufacturing and other equipment with embedded technology  year issues will not present a materially adverse risk to the company s future consolidated results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  if such planned remediation is not completed in a timely manner  the level of timely compliance by key suppliers or dealers is not sufficient  or if unforeseen circumstances arise  year issues could have a material impact on the company s operations including  but not limited to  delays in shipments of products resulting in loss of revenues  increased operating costs  loss of customers or suppliers  or other significant disruptions to the company s business 
the company believes that its year readiness program  including contingency and business continuity plans under development  should generally reduce the extent of materially adverse effects that year related disruptions may have upon the company 
contingency and business continuity planning activities have been initiated in various business areas within the company 
additional planning will occur as the company identifies those circumstances that would require development of a contingency and business continuity plan 
the company believes contingency and business continuity planning efforts to be ongoing activities  subject to frequent review throughout calendar year euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
there will be a transition period from january  through january   at which time all legal tender will convert to the euro 
the company s primary exposure to the euro conversion is concentrated in steelcase strafor 
in december  steelcase strafor created an internal euro committee  a pan european multifunctional team whose goal was to determine the impact of this currency change on products  markets  and information systems 
at this time  steelcase strafor is preparing an implementation of unified price lists for dealers 
the aim is to have three commercial zones in europe within the three year transition period  but no change is expected in calendar steelcase strafor is adapting and migrating its internal system in order to be euro compliant by the end of calendar steelcase strafor is also assisting and educating its dealers to become euro compliant 
training for employees will begin during the transition period 
the transition period is anticipated to resolve difficulties in handling local currencies and the euro simultaneously  while remaining flexible to the market 
steelcase strafor sees the primary financial impact of the euro conversion to be potential savings on foreign exchange hedging and commissions 
based on the euro committee s work to date  the company does not expect the euro conversion to have a material impact on steelcase strafor s financial position  or on the company as a whole 
safe harbor provision there are certain forward looking statements under the overview  liquidity and capital resources  year  and euro conversion sections  particularly those with respect to the company s future product offerings and liquidity and capital needs  future capital expenditures  conversion of class b common shares to class a common shares  the expected ability of and costs to the company and its key customers  dealers and suppliers to successfully manage year issues  and the impact of the euro conversion on the financial position of steelcase strafor and the company 
such statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary from stated expectations 
the company s performance may differ materially from that contemplated by such statements for a variety of reasons  including  but not limited to  competitive and general economic conditions  changes in customer order patterns  continued success in technological advances  including development and implementation of new processes and strategic products for specific market segments  the ability to grow new businesses and successfully integrate and operate any acquired businesses  the impact on the company s business due to internal systems or systems of suppliers  key customers  dealers and other third parties adversely affected by year issues  costs  including claims  due to year issues and remediation efforts  the future success of new products and their impact on our manufacturing processes  the impact of the euro conversion and other risks detailed in this report  and the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission
