statements of operations revenue         salaries  wages and benefits         other operating expenses       depreciation and amortization acquired in process research and development costs  integration costs and acquisition related costs     operating income loss      interest income expense  net provision for income taxes income loss before extraordinary item    extraordinary item net income loss    the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past 
quarterly results have fluctuated as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the company s sales cycle  staffing changes in the company s sales and marketing organization  changes in the company s resources  demand for the company s products  the timing of significant new customer contracts  the non renewal of significant customer contracts  the timing of acquisitions  competitive conditions in the industry  changes in customer budgets  and general economic factors 
the company has historically recorded a disproportionate amount of its revenue for each quarter in the final month of the quarter  while expenses have been incurred more evenly throughout the period 
furthermore  the company has experienced a seasonal pattern in its operating results  with a greater proportion of the company s revenue and operating profitability occurring in the second half of the year 
the company attributes this seasonality to a combination of factors including budgeting and other factors affecting the healthcare industry generally  the compounding effect of historical renewal schedules which typically results in greater license renewals in the third and fourth quarters and internal staffing and growth issues 
the company believes the licensing and subsequent renewal pattern of its market performance products are more seasonal than its other products and expects the addition of new products  including those from acquisitions  to moderate  but not end  this seasonal effect 
a significant portion of the company s expenses is relatively fixed  and the amount and timing of increases in such expenses are based in large part on the company s expectations concerning future revenue 
if revenues are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse effect may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the revenue shortfall 
accordingly  even a small variation from expected revenue could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for a given quarter 
software capitalization in addition to acquisitions  the company seeks to expand its product offerings through internal product development 
the company capitalizes internal product development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established and prior to general product release 
capitalized software development costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled approximately million at december  income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of  during due to limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the non deductibility of certain acquired in process research and development costs to offset taxable income 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in through the total gross deferred tax asset was approximately million as of december  and has been reduced to zero by a valuation allowance and offsetting deferred income tax liabilities of approximately million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
applying the provisions of sfas to the company  particularly considering the company s history of net losses  the company was unable to support a conclusion consistent with sfas that it is more likely than not that it will generate future taxable income during the loss carryforward periods  therefore  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
in determining that a valuation allowance was required  management primarily considered such factors as the company s history of operating losses and expected near term future losses and earnings  the nature of the company s deferred tax assets  the absence of significant excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of the company s net assets  the absence of significant taxable income in prior carryback years and the potential for deferred tax assets resulting from future business acquisitions 
although management s operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods  historical performance has produced an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  consequently  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets until such time as the company produces sufficient taxable and operating income to support a lower valuation allowance 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which expire beginning in through approximately million of the net operating loss at december  relates to loss carryforwards acquired in connection with the acquisitions 
accordingly  such losses are limited to income generated by the acquired entity as well as substantial annual limitations 
liquidity and capital resources in june the company completed the stock offering of  shares of common stock 
as a result of the offering  the company received approximately million  net of offering expenses of approximately  in june the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with nationsbank under which a million revolving credit facility the nationsbank revolver was made available to the company 
the nationsbank revolver is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
under the terms of the nationsbank revolver the company may  subject to customary terms  conditions and covenants  borrow up to million to fund working capital needs  new product development and acquisitions 
the amended and restated credit agreement for the nationsbank revolver provides for interest at varying rates based on libor and nationsbank s prime rate  and will mature on july  under the terms of the nationsbank revolver  the company is subject to various restrictive covenants regarding  among other things  payment of any dividends  capital expenditures limitations  incurrence of indebtedness from others in excess of certain amounts  and consummation of certain mergers and acquisitions without the consent of nationsbank 
financial covenants include  but are not limited to  maintaining debt to capitalization ratios  minimum net worth ratios  debt service coverage ratios and cash flow leverage ratios 
at december   the company had million in borrowing availability remaining on its revolving line of credit 
the company had working capital of million as of december  as compared to working capital of million at december  the increase was due primarily to the net proceeds remaining from the follow on stock offering completed by the company in june net cash used by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase in cash used of million was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and other current assets and the extinguishment of accrued liabilities assumed in the acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year 
in  the company used million in cash to fund partially the acquisitions of healthdemographics  successful solutions and sweetwater and to pay million of contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of caredata 
the remaining million of net cash used in investing activities for was used to fund million in fixed asset purchases  million of software development and  in notes to officers of the company 
the increase in notes to officers is due primarily to a  loan to the company s chairman and chief executive officer 
this loan bears interest at and is payable on july  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year 
in the company received net proceeds of million from its initial public offering  and in june the company received net proceeds of million from its follow on offering 
many of the company s acquisition agreements provide for the payment of contingent consideration based upon the performance of the acquired businesses over a prescribed period of time 
if such acquired businesses exceed the relevant performance goals  the company will be required to make additional payments  which could be material 
in connection with the caredata acquisition  additional consideration of million was paid in april in march  additional consideration of million was paid in connection with the healthdemographics acquisition 
additional payments under these agreements will be forthcoming in the company believes that the remaining proceeds of the stock offering  available borrowings under the nationsbank revolver and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the capital expenditure and working capital needs for the company s operations for the near term 
the company s future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on a wide range of factors  including costs associated with development of new products  enhancements of existing products and acquisitions 
although the company has no present commitments or agreements regarding acquisitions  the company s strategy is to acquire additional complementary products and businesses 
if the remaining proceeds from its june stock offering  borrowings under the nationsbank revolver and cash flow from operations are not sufficient to fund such acquisitions or contingent payments relating to prior acquisitions  the company will be required to seek additional financing  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to the company 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
comprehensive income generally includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distribution to owners 
there was no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements with the adoption of sfas sfas established standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and in interim financial reports to shareholders 
the company adopted both statements in the first quarter of on september  the sec issued a letter to the aicpa sec regulations committee outlining changes that the sec believes should be made to the methodology of calculating acquired in process research and development costs 
the company has applied this new guidance with respect to the acquisitions of healthdemographics in march  successful solutions in may and sweetwater health enterprises in june as a result  certain adjustments relating to acquired in process research and development costs and purchase price allocations associated with such acquisitions have been made to the company s interim period sec filings 
year compliance many of the world s computer systems and non information technology systems have programs and imbedded chips using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if not addressed  such computer systems could be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year many of medirisk s systems and much of its software are year compliant 
to bring the remaining systems and software into compliance by mid  medirisk has designed a year compliance program 
the company has implemented a project team and project plan to manage the year initiative 
the project team has substantially completed the year assessment for all business areas that may be impacted by the year issue  including assessment of the following business areas it systems  non it systems  third parties and medirisk products 
the assessment included an inventory in all areas  state of readiness determination  assessment of risk and cost associated with non compliant items  development of contingency plan steps in the event of non compliance and the remediation steps for non compliant items 
the company s remediation efforts are being prioritized in order of risk  with the most critical items to be corrected immediately 
the company assessed risk based on level of impact to operations and the ability to deliver quality products to its customers 
state of readiness substantially all of the areas the company has assessed are year compliant 
the company has developed a plan to bring the remaining percent of such areas into compliance  and the company has scheduled completion of such plan by august the company is in the process of assessing the year compliance of third parties  including its customers and vendors 
detailed project plans are being designed for bringing all non compliant issues into compliance  however  the process of analyzing year issues  particularly as they relate to customers and suppliers  is ongoing 
cost the company s current estimate of the remaining cost of compliance is under  however  the process of analyzing these issues is ongoing  and the estimate may change 
in addition  the majority of the expenditures expected to be incurred to address year issues were planned and would have been incurred by the company in the normal course of business in the ongoing process of updating and maintaining its systems 
the company s cost estimate does not include unforeseen costs in the event of additional programming hours or similar matters 
the company does not anticipate that the overall costs will have a material impact on the company s financial results or financial condition 
contingency plans the company has developed written contingency plans for all currently identified non compliant items 
medirisk is in the process of developing these plans into a project plan and assigning dates and responsibilities to each action item 
remediation steps the year project team has assessed and documented the remediation steps for the non compliant items and is in the process of executing the project plans to achieve full remediation of all non year compliant items by the second quarter of risk the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems with both its internal systems and those of third parties upon which the company relies 
accordingly  the company has produced a list of all vendors and has assessed the level of impact of each vendor 
medirisk is in the process of querying all vendors and third parties to determine their compliance 
tracking and follow up procedures are being determined and will be prioritized to focus on those vendors determined to have the most impact on the company s business operations 
if the databases or systems of the company  key suppliers of data or key customers are not year compliant  then the cost necessary to update databases or software or potential interruption in the supply of data or interruptions in demand for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial conditions 
effects of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on results of operations for the periods presented 
substantial increases in costs  particularly the cost of labor for product development  marketing and sales  could have an adverse impact on the company and the healthcare information industry 
forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements contained in press releases  the company s filings with the sec and its reports to stockholders 
statements made in this annual report on form k  other than those concerning historical information  should be considered forward looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements are made based on management s belief  as well as on assumptions made by  and information currently available to  management and are made pursuant to  and in reliance upon  the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements due to numerous factors  including the following history of operating losses and uncertain profitability  risks related to growth  risks of integration of acquired operations  dependence on data sources and ama licenses  dependence on intellectual property rights  risks related to intangible assets and acquisition of in process research and development  uncertainty and consolidation in the healthcare industry  risks of rapid technological change  need for additional financing  competition  risks of customer concentration  potential for system defects  variable quarterly operating results and seasonality  year compliance  and adverse impact of anti takeover provisions
