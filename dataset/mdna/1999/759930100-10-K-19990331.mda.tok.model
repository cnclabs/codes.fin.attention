item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview renal care group  inc provides dialysis services to patients with chronic kidney failure 
rcg began operating in february when it acquired the founding companies in the combination simultaneous with its initial public offering 
as of december   the company provided dialysis and ancillary services to approximately  patients through outpatient dialysis centers in states  in addition to providing acute dialysis services in hospitals 
for the comparison discussion that follows  the selected combined and pro forma data include the financial information of the founding companies  and previously reported transactions accounted for as poolings of interests 
because the founding companies and companies added in pooling transactions were independent and not operated by rcg s management before the dates of acquisition  the historical results of such companies before such times may not be indicative of future performance 
rcg s net revenue has been derived primarily from the following sources outpatient hemodialysis services  ancillary services associated with dialysis  primarily the administration of erythopoietin epo  home dialysis services  inpatient hemodialysis services provided pursuant to contracts with acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities  management contracts with hospital based and medical university dialysis programs  laboratory services  and wound care and diabetic services 
esrd patients typically receive three dialysis treatments each week  with reimbursement for services provided primarily by the medicare esrd program based on rates established by hcfa 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s net revenue was derived from reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare reimbursement is subject to rate and other legislative changes by congress and periodic changes in regulations  including changes that may reduce payments under the esrd program 
the medicare composite rate applies to a designated group of dialysis services  including the dialysis treatment  supplies used for such treatment  certain laboratory tests and medications  and most of the home dialysis services provided by rcg 
certain other services and drugs are eligible for separate reimbursement under medicare and are not part of the composite rate  including specific drugs such as epo and some physician ordered tests provided to dialysis patients 
for patients with private health insurance  dialysis was historically reimbursed at rates higher than medicare during the first months of treatment  and after that time medicare became the primary payor 
effective august   however  the health insurance coordination period during which private insurance must pay for dialysis was extended to months of treatment  and after that period medicare becomes the primary payor 
reimbursement for dialysis services provided pursuant to a hospital contract is negotiated with the individual hospital and generally is higher on a per treatment equivalent basis than the medicare composite rate 
because dialysis is a life sustaining therapy used to treat this chronic disease  utilization is predictable and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations 
results of operations as indicated elsewhere  in february rcg commenced its business with the simultaneous acquisition of the five founding companies in the combination 
as a result of the combination  a comparison of the current operations of rcg to its historical operations prior to the combination is not considered meaningful 
therefore  the results of operations for all periods in the table below and in the period comparisons that follow reflect the historical operations of the company combined with the operations of the founding companies on a pro forma basis as if the combination had occurred for all periods presented 
in addition  after december   rcg merged with dialysis centers of america  inc in a transaction that will be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a result  rcg s financial statements will be restated  and the results of operations reflected in the table below may not be comparable to those giving effect to the restatement 
the following table sets forth  results of operations in thousands for the periods indicated and the percentage of net revenue represented by the respective financial line items year ended december  net revenue    patient care costs    general and administrative expenses    provision for doubtful accounts    depreciation and amortization    merger expenses   total operating costs and expenses    income from operations    interest income expense net  minority interest  income before income taxes    year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the number of treatments from  in to  in this growth in treatments is a result of the acquisition and development of various dialysis facilities and a increase in same center treatments for over in addition  average net revenue per dialysis treatment increased from in to in the remaining revenue increase is a result of wound care and diabetes revenues following rcg s entrance into that business with the december acquisition of integrated wound care  inc formerly known as stat management  inc  higher management fees and increased earnings of unconsolidated partnerships in compared to the increase in revenue per treatment was due to an improvement in the company s payor mix  increases in epo and other drug utilization  increases in acute hospital services  the implementation of rcg s in house laboratory services and the positive impact on commercial payments of the medicare secondary payor provisions of the balanced budget act

as of december   this was primarily comprised of three joint venture partnerships 
liquidity and capital resources rcg requires capital primarily to acquire and develop dialysis centers  to purchase property and equipment for existing centers  and to finance working capital needs 
at december   rcg s working capital was million  cash and cash equivalents were million  and the company s current ratio was to rcg s working capital increased during the year primarily due to acquisitions  the increase in long term debt primarily to fund those acquisitions and the increase in net income 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities consists of net income before depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets net of liabilities

rcg is a party to a first amended and restated loan agreement for a million credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility may be used for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and general corporate purposes 
no more than million of the credit facility may be used for working capital purposes 
within the working capital sublimit  rcg may borrow up to million in swing line loans 
rcg has negotiated loan pricing based on a libo rate margin pursuant to leverage tiers 
these leverage tiers extend from to times and are priced at a libo rate margin of to 
commitment fees are also priced pursuant to leverage ratio tiers 
commitment fees range from to pursuant to leverage ratios ranging between and 
under the loan agreement  commitments range in amounts and dates from the closing date through august rcg has obtained total lender commitments of million through august lender commitments are then reduced to million through august  million through august and million through august all loans under the loan agreement are due and payable on august  on december   there was million outstanding under this agreement 
in connection with the merger with dialysis centers of america  inc in january  rcg incurred approximately million in additional indebtedness under this agreement to repay certain dca indebtedness and fund dca s working capital needs 
under the loan agreement  each of rcg s subsidiaries has guaranteed of all of rcg s obligations under the loan agreement 
further  rcg s obligations under the loan agreement  and the obligations of each of its subsidiaries under its guaranty  are secured by a pledge of the equity interests held by rcg in each of the subsidiaries 
financial covenants are customary based on the amount and duration of this commitment 
a significant component of rcg s growth strategy is the acquisition and development of dialysis facilities 
rcg believes that existing cash and funds from operations  together with funds available under the line of credit  will be sufficient to meet rcg s acquisition  expansion  capital expenditure and working capital needs for the next months 
however  to finance certain large strategic acquisition opportunities  rcg may need to incur additional short and long term bank indebtedness and may issue equity or debt securities 
the availability and terms of any additional financing will depend on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms 
capital expenditures of approximately million  primarily for equipment replacement  expansion of existing dialysis facilities and construction of new de novo facilities are planned in rcg expects that such capital expenditures will be funded with cash provided by operating activities and available lines of credit 
rcg believes that capital resources available to it will be sufficient to meet the needs of its business  both on a short and long term basis

impact of year introduction 
the term year issue is a general term used to describe various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year is approached and reached 
these problems arise from hardware and software unable to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s and from other sources such as the use of special codes and conventions in software that make use of a date field 
rcg s state of readiness 
rcg s efforts in addressing the year issue are focused in the following four areas developing awareness and educating employees regarding the year issue  implementing procedures to determine whether rcg s software systems and hardware platforms are year compliant and communicating with suppliers and third party payors to determine whether there will be any interruption in their systems that could affect rcg s ability to receive timely shipments of inventory or payment for services as a result of the year issue  evaluating and making necessary modifications to rcg s software and hardware systems and other systems that contain imbedded chips  such as phone systems  which process dates and date sensitive materials  and testing of systems for year compliance 
the company has completed its initial assessment of key computer systems and electronic devices and expects to complete a more detailed inventory of each facility by april  the company is developing and implementing plans to remediate year issues identified in the assessment phase 
rcg expects to complete the remediation phase by june  and the testing phase by august  the education phase will be an on going process throughout rcg is in the process of obtaining written confirmation from vendors that rcg s software applications and hardware platforms acquired from such vendors will correctly manipulate dates and date related data as the year is approached and reached 
based on an initial assessment of its core clinical and financial systems  the company has determined the following over of rcg s core systems are packaged applications licensed from third party vendors  thus less than were developed internally  and substantially all of such third party applications have been certified to rcg by their manufacturers as fully year compliant  or as upgradable to become compliant with minor upgrades 
furthermore  to improve its operating performance and efficiency  rcg has undertaken a number of significant information system initiatives 
these initiatives include the selection and implementation of a new laboratory system  a new human resources and payroll system  a new universal patient index and registration system  and a new practice management system 
rcg expects these systems to be put into use in the manufacturers of these new systems have certified that these systems are year compliant 
the company currently believes that with upgrades or replacements of certain software and hardware  rcg s internal systems will be substantially year compliant 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the software applications and hardware platforms on which rcg s business relies will correctly manipulate dates and date related data as the year is approached and reached 
such failures could have a material adverse effect on rcg s financial condition  results of operations and business 
rcg s business relies heavily upon its ability to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  including medicare  medicaid and private insurers  and to obtain water  power and other supplies from vendors 
rcg is in the process of obtaining written verification from its major suppliers  and certain significant third party payors  to determine whether there will be any interruption in the provision of supplies or reimbursement for services performed resulting from the year issue 
rcg expects to complete this process by may  at this time  hcfa has testified to a committee of the us house of representatives that it is far behind in remedying year problems 
the failure of hcfa  medicare intermediaries  medicaid payors or any of rcg s other significant third party payors to remedy year related problems could result in a delay in rcg s receipt of payments for services which could have a material adverse impact on the company s earnings  financial condition and business 
furthermore  a delay in receiving supplies from certain vendors could hinder rcg s ability to provide services to patients which could have a material adverse impact on rcg s earnings  financial condition and business 
rcg is aware that certain of its systems  such as dialysis and other medical equipment  phone systems  facsimile machines  heating and air conditioning  security systems and other non data processing oriented systems may include imbedded chips that process dates and date sensitive material 
these imbedded chips are both difficult to identify in all instances and difficult to repair  often  total replacement of the chips is necessary 
rcg intends to perform an evaluation of its systems to determine whether rcg needs to repair or replace any chips to avoid year problems 
if rcg fails to identify or remediate any imbedded chips either on an individual or an aggregate basis on which significant business operations depend  such as phone systems  there could be a material adverse impact on rcg s earnings  financial condition and business 
costs to address rcg s year issues 
rcg will utilize both internal and external resources to complete its year project 
rcg estimates that the cost to remediate year issues that have been identified and to test systems to verify year compliance will be between  and  and will be incurred primarily in the first and second quarters of the total cost of the year effort is not known at this time  but will be determined when the assessment phase of the plan is completed 
risks presented by year issues 
rcg is still in the process of evaluating potential disruptions or complications that might result from year related problems 
at this time  rcg has not identified any specific business functions that will suffer material disruption as a result of year related events 
the company may  however  identify business functions in the future that are specifically at risk of year disruption 
rcg s failure at this point to identify year risks should not be construed to mean that there is no risk of year related disruption 
moreover  due to the unique and pervasive nature of the year issue  rcg cannot anticipate each of the wide variety of year events  particularly outside of the company  that might arise in a worst case scenario and might have a material adverse effect on rcg s results of operations and business 
rcg s contingency plans 
since rcg has not identified any specific business function that will be materially at risk of significant year related disruptions  and because a full assessment of the company s risk from potential year failures is still in process  rcg has not yet developed detailed contingency plans specific to year problems 
rcg has scheduled an evaluation of the status of completion of its year initiatives in march and will determine at that time whether a contingency plan will be developed 
impact of inflation a substantial portion of rcg s net revenue is subject to reimbursement rates that are regulated by the federal government and do not automatically adjust for inflation 
rcg is unable to increase the amount it receives for the services provided by its dialysis business that are reimbursed under the medicare composite rate 
increased operating costs due to inflation  such as labor and supply costs  without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates  may adversely affect rcg s results of operations  financial condition and business 
forward looking information certain of the matters discussed in the preceding pages of this form k  particularly regarding implementation of the company s strategy  development of the dialysis and nephrology industries  anticipated growth and revenues  anticipated working capital and sources of funding for growth opportunities and construction  expenditures  interest  costs and income  and the effects of year issues constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended see risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk rcg maintains all cash in united states dollars in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade instruments with maturities of less than three months  which rcg considers cash equivalents  therefore  rcg has no market risk sensitive instruments  and no disclosure is required under this item
