item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years   the following commentary presents management s discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the review highlights the principal factors affecting earnings and the significant changes in balance sheet items for the years  and financial information for prior years is presented when appropriate 
the objective of this financial review is to enhance the reader s understanding of the accompanying tables and charts  the consolidated financial statements  notes to financial statements  and financial statistics appearing elsewhere in this report 
where applicable  this discussion also reflects management s insights of known events and trends that have or may reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the corporation s operations and financial condition 
all financial data has been restated to give effect to acquisitions accounted for on a pooling of interests basis and stock splits in previous periods 
the results of other bank and branch acquisitions  accounted for as purchases  have been included effective with the respective dates of acquisition 
earnings summary the corporation s earnings totaled million  or per share  after merger related expenses of million  compared to million  or per share  for reported net income for  including the merger related costs  was million  or per share 
these results reflect the restatement of both years financial information to account for the acquisition of security first on a pooling of interests basis 
additionally  results include the earnings of cobancorp  which was accounted for as a purchase transaction  from the merger date of may  because results of cobancorp are included in totals for approximately seven months  all individual categories discussed throughout the annual report will have unquantifiable increases over due solely to the acquisition 
excluding the merger related costs  returns on average equity roe and average assets roa were and compared to and for the prior year 
roe and roa based on reported net income of million were and  respectively 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis reached million for the year compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase occurred because of earning asset volume gains of 
the net interest margin declined from in to for  due mainly to a lower interest rate environment 
adjusted net revenue for of million represents a increase from its year earlier level of million 
adjusted net revenue is defined as net interest income on a tax equivalent basis added to other income  less securities gains 
the growth in other income and earning assets more than offset the compression in the net interest margin 
excluding gains from the sale of securities  other income was million  or higher than the million reported for other income now accounts for of net revenue compared with a year ago 
fee improvement was evident across the board as follows trust fees  up million  or  credit card fees  up million  or  service charges  up million  or  other service fees  up million  or  and other operating income  up million  or 
excluding the million pre tax charge related to the security first merger  other expenses totaled million for the year compared with million for the prior year  an increase of 
reported other expenses  when the merger costs are included  were million 
most expense categories are consistent with the prior year performance when measured as a percentage of assets for each period 
amortization of intangibles resulting from the cobancorp acquisition has risen sharply  from million in to million for after adjusting for merger related expenses  the efficiency ratio was  same as last year 
the provision for loan losses of million includes a merger related increase of million 
net charge offs as a percentage of average outstanding loans totaled for compared to last year 
at year end  the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans stands at compared to the reserve level of of outstanding loans

net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest and loan fee income on earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  is the principal source of earnings for the corporation 
throughout this discussion net interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis which restates interest on tax exempt securities and loans as if such interest were subject to federal income tax at the statutory rate 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
the following table shows the allocation to assets  the source of funding and their respective interest spreads 
average net earning interest interest assets spread income dollars in thousands interest bearing liabilities   non interest bearing liabilities and equity   average net earning interest interest assets spread income interest bearing liabilities   non interest bearing liabilities and equity   average net earning interest interest assets spread income interest bearing liabilities   non interest bearing liabilities and equity   yield on earning assets 
net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and million in the increase over occurred because the rise in interest income more than offset the increase in interest expense 
specifically  interest income rose million while interest expense increased million  or 
interest income was higher than last year because average earning assets grew or million 
the increase in average earning assets was attributable to the cobancorp  purchase acquisition on may  and strong loan demand 
under purchase accounting rules  the results of the acquired company are included in current year totals from the date of the acquisition through the end of the year  related prior period totals do not contain the results of the acquired company 
the average yield on earning assets decreased basis points from in to during in summary  higher earning asset volumes outpaced the decline in earning asset rates resulting in higher interest income 
higher interest expense was again volume related as deposits and other borrowings were used to fund the earning asset growth 
similar to the asset scenario described in the preceding paragraph  the cobancorp acquisition played a large part in the higher funding balances and resultant increase in interest expense 
the cost of funds for the year as a percentage of average earning assets increased from in to this year 
the following table illustrates the specific year over year impact to net interest income based on changes in the rate and volume components of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest differential fully tax equivalent rate volume analysis years ended december  and and increase decrease in increase decrease in interest income expense interest income expense yield yield volume rate total volume rate total dollars in thousands interest income investment securities taxable       tax exempt  loans       federal funds sold     total interest income       interest expense interest on deposits demand interest bearing     savings      certificates and other time deposits cds      federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings    total interest expense     net interest income       note the variance created by a combination of rate and volume has been allocated entirely to the volume column 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread 
in addition  the net interest margin is impacted by changes in federal income tax rates and regulations as they affect the tax equivalent adjustment 
the net interest margin for was compared to in and in the decline in the net interest margin compared to last year was mainly due to falling interest rates during the year lower interest rate spread

increases in all categories below occurred because of the cobancorp purchase acquisition as well as continued company emphasis on improving other income fee income 
dollars in thousands trust fees    service charges on deposits    credit card fees    service fees other    mortgage sales and servicing    securities gains losses    gains from branch subsidiary sales  other operating income    trust fees increased million or to million in service charges on deposits rose million or compared to last year 
credit card fees increased million in partially due to increased merchant activity and the cobancorp acquisition 
other service fees rose million  or compared to last year  a major component of this category is atm fees 
income from mortgage sales and servicing was up million  these gains occur as the corporation s mortgage company sells mortgage loans to the secondary market 
securities gains increased million  or as the corporation sold several groups of mortgage backed securities at gains 
the sales of the mortgage backed securities occurred as management saw the opportunity to take gains on sales  to reinvest the proceeds in higher yielding commercial and consumer credits  and to sell before further run off of these loans occurred during a high refinancing period 
other operating income was up million mainly because of the cobancorp acquisition 
excluding gains from sales of securities  other income was million and now represent of net revenue compared to last year 
net revenue is defined as net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  plus other income  less securities gains 
federal income tax federal income tax expense totaled million in compared to million in  and in in the effective federal income tax rate for the corporation equaled compared to in and in other expenses adjusted other expenses  excluding merger related costs  were million in compared to million in and million in  excluding the million pre tax saif assessment

the total pre tax merger related costs incurred were million  of which million affected other expenses as indicated in the table above 
the remaining costs were an increase of million to the provision for loan losses and a million decline in other income 
adjusted salaries  wages  pension and benefits totaled million in  an increase of million or from and more than increases over both periods are due to the cobancorp purchase and employee annual merit increases 
adjusted bankcard  loan processing  and other fees increased million to million in the corporation s efforts to improve the efficiency of cobancorp  acquired on may   are still under way 
amortization of intangible expense during was million  up million from and million from the increase was due to the cobancorp acquisition 
the decline in intangible amortization expense compared to occurred as branch sales  many in the fourth quarter  lessened goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
excluding the merger related expenses  the efficiency ratio for was compared to last year 
the lower is better efficiency ratio indicates the percentage of operating costs that is used to generate each dollar of net revenue that is  during  cents was spent to generate of net revenue 
investment securities the investment portfolio is maintained by the corporation to provide liquidity  earnings  and as a means of diversifying risk 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  securities have been classified as available for sale 
in this classification  adjustment to fair value of the securities available for sale in the form of unrealized holding gains and losses  is excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in a separate component of shareholders equity 
the adjustments to increase fair value at year ends and were million and million  respectively 
at year end  investment securities totaled  million compared with  million one year earlier  an increase of 
investment securities totaled  million at the end of a summary of investment securities carrying value is presented below as of year ends  and presented with the summary is a maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted average yields

the yield on the portfolio was in compared to in and in loans total loans outstanding at year end increased compared to one year ago or  million compared to  million 
a breakdown by category is presented below  along with a maturity summary of commercial  financial and agricultural loans 
year ends  dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      installments to individuals      real estate      lease financing      total loans      less allowance for possible loan losses      net loans      year end commercial  financial and agricultural due in one year or less  due after one year but within five years  due after five years  total  loans due after one year with interest at a predetermined fixed rate  loans due after one year with interest at a floating rate  total  real estate loans at year end totaled  million or of total loans outstanding compared to one year ago 
residential loans family dwellings totaled  million  home equity loans million  construction loans million and commercial real estate loans  million 
the year end real estate totals point out the shift in the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio from residential real estate to higher yielding commercial and consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans include both commercial loans where real estate has been taken as collateral as well as loans for commercial real estate 
the majority of commercial real estate loans are to owner occupants where cash flow to service debt is derived from the occupying business cash flow instead of normal building rents 
these loans are generally part of an overall relationship with existing customers primarily within northeast ohio 
consumer loans or loans to individuals increased compared to last year and accounted for of total loans compared to in commercial  financial  and agricultural loans increased during and make up of total outstanding loans compared to last year 
again  the increase in consumer and commercial loans is evidence of firstmerit s shifting loan portfolio 
lease financing loans increased during auto leases totaled million with equipment leasing totaling million  and leveraged leases were million at year end there is no concentration of loans in any particular industry or group of industries 
most of the corporation s business activity is with customers located within the state of ohio 
asset quality making a loan to earn an interest spread inherently includes taking the risk of not being repaid 
successful management of credit risk requires making good underwriting decisions  carefully administering the loan portfolio and diligently collecting delinquent accounts 
the corporation s credit policy division manages credit risk by establishing common credit policies for its subsidiary bank  participating in approval of their largest loans  conducting reviews of their loan portfolios  providing them with centralized consumer underwriting  collections and loan operations services  and overseeing their loan workouts 
the corporation s objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and statement no 
 an amendment of statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
these statements provide guidance for determining the allowance for loan loses related to impaired loans and illustrate the required financial statement disclosures for impaired loans 
impaired loans are loans for which current information or events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans must be valued based on the present value of the loans expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rates  at the loans observable market price  or the fair value of the loan collateral 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful 
restructured loans on which  due to deterioration in the borrower s financial condition  the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven

s and impaired loans as defined by statements and exclude certain consumer loans  residential real estate loans  and leases classified as non accrual 
consumer installment loans are charged off when they reach days past due 
credit card loans are charged off when they reach days past due 
when any other loan becomes days past due  it is placed on non accrual status unless it is well secured and in the process of collection 
any losses are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses as soon as they are identified 
non performing assets at year end were million  million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans outstanding plus ore  non performing assets were at year end compared to in and in the average balances of impaired loans for the years ended and were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended  impaired assets earned million in interest income 
had they not been impaired  they would have earned million 
for the same period  total non performing loans earned million in interest income 
had they been paid in accordance with the payment terms in force prior to being considered impaired  on non accrual status  or restructured  they would have earned million 
in addition to non performing loans and loans days past due and still accruing interest  management identified potential problem loans totaling million at year end these loans are closely monitored for any further deterioration in the borrowers financial condition and for the borrowers ability to comply with terms of the loans 
allowance for possible loan losses the corporation maintains what management believes is an adequate allowance for possible loan losses 
the corporation and the subsidiary bank regularly analyze the adequacy of their allowances through ongoing reviews of trends in risk ratings  delinquencies  non performing assets  charge offs  economic conditions  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
at year end the corporation boosted its allowance for possible loan losses in response to the continuing shift of its portfolio out of residential mortgage loans and into commercial and consumer loans  which historically have exhibited higher loss rates 
management felt it was prudent to increase the allowance at year end to ensure its adequacy for changes that have occurred in the loan portfolio 
at year end  the allowance was million or of loans outstanding compared to million or at year end and million or at year end the allowance equaled of non performing loans at year end compared to at year end the allowance for possible loan losses related to impaired loans at year ends and totaled million for both periods 
net charge offs were million in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of average loans outstanding  net charge offs equaled in  in and in losses are charged against the allowance as soon as they are identified

most of the increase occurred because of the purchase acquisition of cobancorp 
purchase accounting application includes balances of the acquired company in the year of acquisition but not in prior periods 
the corporation s success with its free checking product also added to the increase in average non interest bearing demand deposit checking accounts 
interest bearing demand accounts declined during despite the inclusion of cobancorp balances 
average savings and certificate of deposit cds accounts were up and  respectively  over last years averages 
again  the cobancorp acquisition accounted for a large portion  if not all  of the increases in savings and cds 
the average rate paid on interest bearing demand deposits decreased basis points to  the average yield paid on savings accounts increased basis points to and the average yield paid on cds declined basis point from in to in total demand deposits comprised of average deposits in compared with last year and in savings accounts  including the money market products  made up of average deposits in versus in and in cds accounted for of average deposits in  in and in the most notable shift occurred between savings and demand deposit checking accounts as checking balances provided more funds  on average  and savings accounts less

amount maturing in under months  to months  to months  over months  interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the potential exposure of earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation has a policy which provides guidelines in the management of interest rate risk 
this policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it complies to trends within the financial markets and within the industry 
the analysis presented below divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion which it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the analysis shows that liabilities maturing within one year exceed assets maturing within the same period by a moderate amount 
the corporation uses the gap analysis and other tools to monitor rate risk 
at year end the corporation was in a moderate asset sensitive position as illustrated in the following table over days days days days days year total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans and leases        investment securities        federal funds sold   total interest earning assets        interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing      savings      certificates and other time deposits        securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings      total interest bearing liabilities        total gap        cumulative gap       market risk firstmerit is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business 
changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee of the firstmerit bank board of directors alco oversees financial risk management  establishing broad policies that govern a variety of financial risks inherent in the bank s operations 
alco monitors firstmerit bank s interest rates and sets limits on allowable risk annually 
market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
firstmerit s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk on firstmerit s balance sheet consists of mismatches of maturity gaps and indices  and options risk 
maturity gap mismatches result from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios 
options risk exists in many of firstmerit s retail products such as prepayable mortgage loans and demand deposits 
options risk typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for firstmerit 
index mismatches occur when asset and liability portfolios are tied to different market indices which may not move in tandem as market interest rates change 
interest rate risk is monitored using gap analysis  earnings simulation and net present value estimations 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk in the balance sheet at a point in time 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
alco also monitors the net present value of the balance sheet  which is the discounted present value of all asset and liability cash flows 
interest rate risk is quantified by changing the interest rates used for discounting cash flows and comparing the net present value to the original figure 
at year end  a basis point increase in interest rates is estimated to reduce net present value by 
should interest rates decrease by basis points  net present value is estimated to increase by

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia set capital guidelines for a financial institution to be considered well capitalized 
these guidelines require a risk based capital ratio of  a tier i capital ratio of and a leverage ratio of 
at year end  the corporation s risk based capital equaled of risk adjusted assets  its tier i capital ratio equaled and its leverage ratio equaled 
the corporation s board of directors declared a for split of the corporation s common stock on september  the split was paid to shareholders of record as of september  during  the corporation s directors increased the quarterly cash dividend  marking the seventeenth consecutive year of annual increases since the corporation s formation in the cash dividend of paid has an indicated annual rate of per share 
over the past five years the dividend has increased at an annual rate of approximately 
liquidity the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its strong core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system  along with a strong capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments 
the banking subsidiary maintains sufficient liquidity in the form of short term marketable investments with a short term maturity structure  along with cash flow from loan repayment 
asset growth is primarily funded by the growth of core deposits 
reliance on borrowed funds increased during the year as the investment portfolio grew slightly 
during the year  the corporation sold  for liquidity purposes  approximately million of fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans 
the loan sales improved liquidity while restructuring the balance sheet to higher yielding assets 
the liquidity needs of the corporation  primarily cash dividends and other corporate purposes  are met through cash  short term investments and dividends from the banking subsidiary 
management is not aware of any trend or event  other than noted above  which will result in or that is reasonably likely to occur that would result in a material increase or decrease in the corporation s liquidity 
regulation and supervision a strict uniform system of capital based regulation of financial institutions became effective on december  under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category 
at year end  the corporation and its subsidiaries all exceeded the minimum capital levels of the well capitalized category 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not move with the same velocity or within the same time frame  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this annual report  based on historical data  has a direct correlation to the influence of market levels of interest rates 
therefore  management believes that there is no material benefit in presenting a statement of financial data adjusted for inflationary changes 
forward looking statements safe harbor statement information in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section above and within this report  which is not historical or factual in nature  and which relates to expectations for future shifts in loan portfolio to consumer and commercial loans  increase in core deposits base  allowance for loan losses  demands for firstmerit services and products  future services and products to be offered  increased numbers of customers  and like items  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the following factors are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  business conditions in the banking industry  the regulatory environment  rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards  competitive factors  including increased competition with regional and national financial institutions  new service and product offerings by competitors and price pressures  interest rate fluctuations  the ability of the corporation to realize expected efficiencies from recent acquisitions and like items 
firstmerit cautions that any forward looking statements contained in this report  in a report incorporated by reference to this report  or made by management of firstmerit in this report  in other reports and filings  in press releases and in oral statements  involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based upon the factors listed above and like items 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied  and therefore the forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
firstmerit may from time to time issue other forward looking statements 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define an applicable year 
any of a company s hardware  date driven automated equipment  or computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this faulty recognition could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
significant resources continue to be used to address the year issue 
consulting and contract programming resources supplement internal staff and provide specialized expertise where necessary 
firstmerit is using newly acquired software tools and enhanced procedures to assist in code remediation  testing  and controlling the numerous software changes 
staff throughout the organization reviews testing results 
coordination with major business partners is also in process 
the corporation first contracted the services of an application development  outsourcing and integration services firm  to perform an enterprise wide business unit risk assessment of year issues 
by year end  the firm had completed the enterprise wide business unit risk assessment for the corporation which included formal communications with all significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the corporation is vulnerable to those third parties failure to address their own year issues 
during  the corporation contracted with a different outside consulting firm to provide an independent assessment of the corporation s year efforts 
results were reported to the corporation s board of directors in november management and the board of directors agreed with the findings and overall view that the project is on track 
the issues identified by the independent consultants were already in process of being addressed 
additionally  as a nationally chartered bank the corporation s banking subsidiary falls under the regulatory guidelines published by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
periodic audits of the corporation s year activities are performed by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ as well as the federal reserve bank 
the ffiec considers five general year phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
the five phases are explained below along with corporation s status at december  awareness the awareness phase defines the year problem  gains executive level support and establishes an overall strategy 
the corporation began working on the year issue in with identification of major vendors and their compliance status 
significant progress has been made in the implementation of the strategy for year compliance 
executive management has been proactive in the management of the project and contracted with consultants to assist in performing the assessment and formulating a strategy 
the awareness phase has expanded to include a widespread customer awareness program to help educate customers of the year issue and allow monitoring of firstmerit s progress 
assessment the assessment phase defines the size and complexity of the problem and the magnitude of the effort to address year issues 
firstmerit completed the assessment phase for all mainframe and microcomputer systems during the first quarter of firstmerit has mainframe applications of which are considered mission critical 
the majority of the applications are vendor packages 
significant microcomputer software and hardware upgrades for year compliance are substantially complete 
the assessment of non information systems such as security systems  elevators  etc 
was completed during the second quarter of renovation the purpose of the renovation phase is to ensure all date routines have been corrected to properly address year dates 
firstmerit has completed of the renovation for the in house written code for the mission critical applications 
installation of vendor supplied upgrades for the other mission critical applications has occurred where the software was received timely 
late arriving vendor releases or re releases of year compliant software has resulted in our inability to complete three of the mission critical applications until the first quarter of renovation and vendor software implementation is also in process for the non mission critical applications 
firstmerit is approximately complete in having all of our lines of computer code renovated 
the remaining applications are scheduled to be renovated during the first quarter validation the validation phase consists of various types of testing and retesting 
firstmerit is deeply involved in extensive testing of both in house and vendor written systems as well as the various connections to other systems internal and external 
non information system applications or functions such as vaults and security systems are also in the process of being tested 
testing guidelines have been issued to ensure consistency and completeness throughout the organization 
integrated testing is in process to ensure the applications work together 
more than of our lines of computer code were successfully tested with various future dates as part of a major integrated test over columbus day weekend in october core systems were included such as certificates of deposit  demand deposit  installment loan and savings 
of the mission critical applications  have been successfully tested or are in the process of being tested 
additionally  many other applications non mission critical are currently in the testing process 
implementation during the implementation phase  systems are certified as year compliant and placed into production 
firstmerit has been placing systems  once renovated and validated  into production throughout the project 
as the non mission critical applications are tested  they will be implemented into production during the first quarter of another ffiec area to be addressed is contingency planning 
firstmerit is considering alternative measures throughout the organization in event of a year caused problem 
business areas have reviewed departmental year risks and are incorporating changes to their contingency plans 
the corporation s total year readiness project costs and estimates to complete include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of a third party vendor s year issues and are based on presently available information 
there can be no guarantees  however  that the systems and applications of other companies on which the corporation s systems and applications rely will be timely converted or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the corporation s systems and applications  would not have material adverse effect on the corporation 
the total cost of the year readiness project operating and capital is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows  which will be expensed as incurred over the next two years  and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
to date  the corporation has expensed approximately million and capitalized approximately  related to the year project 
the costs of the year readiness project and the date on which the corporation plans to complete year remediation are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party vendor remediation plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee  however  that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of trained programming personnel  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer coding  and similar uncertainties
