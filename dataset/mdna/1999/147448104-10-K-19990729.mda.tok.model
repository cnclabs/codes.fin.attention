item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview the company is a regional  integrated solid waste services company that provides collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in vermont  new hampshire  maine  upstate new york  massachusetts and northern pennsylvania 
the company s objective is to continue to grow by expanding its services in markets where it can be one of the largest and most profitable fully integrated solid waste services companies 
the company s revenues have increased from million for the fiscal year ended april   to million for the fiscal year ended april  from may  through april   the company acquired solid waste collection  transfer and disposal operations 
between may and july   the company acquired an additional nine such businesses 
all but six of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
under the rules of purchase accounting the acquired companies revenues and results of operations have been included together with those of casella waste systems  inc from the actual dates of the acquisitions and will materially affect the period to period comparisons of the company s historical results of operations 
in december the company acquired a waste collection and transfer operation in a transaction recorded as a pooling of interests 
during the fiscal year ended april  the company acquired five waste collection  transfer and disposal operations in transactions accounted for as poolings of interest 
under the rules governing poolings of interest  the prior period and year to date financial statements of the company have been restated for all prior years to reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the merged entities as if they had been one company for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
this annual report and other reports  proxy statements  and other communications to stockholders  as well as oral statements by the company s officers or its agents  may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act  with respect to  among other things  the company s future revenues  operating income  or earnings per share 
without limiting the foregoing  any statements contained in this annual report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements  and the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors of which the company is aware that may cause the company s actual results to vary materially from those forecast or projected in any such forward looking statement  certain of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include  without limitation  those outlined below in the section entitled certain factors that may affect future results 
the company s failure to successfully address any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
general the company s revenues are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for solid waste collection  disposal  transfer and recycling services 
the company derives a substantial portion of its collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of the company s residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at the company s disposal facilities and transfer stations 
the majority of the company s landfill and transfer customers are under one year to ten year disposal contracts  with most having clauses for annual cost of living increases 
recycling revenues consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and from the sale of tire derived fuel 
other revenues consist primarily of revenue from waste tire tipping fees  and septic liquid waste operations 
the company s revenues are shown net of intercompany eliminations 
the company typically establishes its intercompany transfer pricing based upon prevailing market rates 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  the percentage of the company s revenues attributable to services provided 
the increase in the company s collection revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal and fiscal is primarily attributable to the impact of the company s acquisition of collection businesses during these periods  as well as to internal growth through price and business volume increases 
the decrease in the company s landfill revenues and in the company s transfer revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal and fiscal is mainly due to a proportionately greater increase in collection and other revenues occurring as the result of acquisitions in those areas  also  as the company acquires collection businesses from which it previously had derived transfer or disposal revenues  the acquired revenues are recorded by the company as collection revenues 
of revenues year ended april  collection landfill transfer recycling other total revenues cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties 
landfill operating expenses also include a provision for closure and post closure expenditures anticipated to be incurred in the future  and leachate treatment and disposal costs 
general and administrative expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  professional services and costs associated with the company s marketing and sales force and community relations expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of production method  and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets using the straight line method 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
the company depreciates all fixed and intangible assets  excluding non depreciable land  down to a net book value  and does not apply a salvage value to any of its fixed assets 
certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs directly associated with expansion of existing landfills  are capitalized by the company 
additionally  the company also capitalizes certain third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering 
the company will have material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of its existing landfills and any disposal facilities which it may own or operate in the future 
the company has provided and will in the future provide accruals for future financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of its landfills generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
there can be no assurance that the company s financial obligations for closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds 
the company routinely evaluates all such capitalized costs  and expenses those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred

liquidity and capital resources the company s business is capital intensive 
the company s capital requirements include acquisitions  fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures for landfill development  cell construction  and site and cell closure 
the company had positive net working capital of million at april  compared to million positive net working capital at april the company has a million revolving line of credit with a group of banks for which bankboston  na is acting as agent 
this line of credit is secured by all assets of the company  including the company s interest in the equity securities of its subsidiaries 
subject to the following paragraph  this revolving line of credit matures in january  funds available to the company under the line of credit were million at april  as a result of its announced merger with kti  the company is required to obtain a new line of credit within days after the closing of the merger or august   whichever is earlier 
the company is currently seeking a new five year revolving line of credit of million to million 
the syndication of this credit facility was not complete as of july  in july the company completed a follow on public offering of  shares of its class a common stock at per share 
in addition  as part of this same offering   shares of the company s class a common stock were sold by certain selling shareholders at per share 
the company s proceeds of the offering  net of underwriters discounts and issuance costs were  the proceeds were used for debt reduction  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
as part of the july public stock offering the company registered an additional  shares of its class a common stock as a shelf registration 
the intended use of these additional registered but unissued shares is as an additional source of capital for the company s acquisition policy 
as of april    shares of the company s class a common stock had been issued pursuant to this registration statement 
the company believes that its cash provided internally from operations together with the company s available credit facilities and anticipated new credit facility should enable it to meet its needs for working capital for the next twelve months 
in addition  the company also plans to file a new shelf registration statement following the kti merger for use in connection with its acquisition program 
net cash provided by operations for the fiscal years ended april  and april  was million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in the company s net income for the fiscal year  together with an increase in depreciation and amortization and an increase in the company s accrued closure and post closure costs 
the increase in the closure post closure accrual is due to the completion in the fiscal year of work required to close an unlined cell at the clinton county landfill and at stage one of the company s nces landfill 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal primarily due to increases in net income  depreciation and amortization  asset impairment charges and deferred income tax provisions  offset by decreases in accrued closure post closure costs and in the company s working capital 
for fiscal and fiscal  cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
the increase in investing activities reflects the company s capital expenditure and capital needs for acquisitions which have increased significantly  reflecting the company s rapid growth by acquisition and development of revenue producing assets 
the company s cash needs to fund investing activities are expected to increase further as the company continues to complete acquisitions 
for fiscal and fiscal  the company s financing activities provided cash of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the fiscal year ended april  the net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal years ended april  and primarily reflects the net proceeds of the public stock offerings and borrowings on the company s credit facility  offset by repayments 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflects primarily bank borrowings and seller subordinated notes  less principal payments on debt 
seasonality the company s revenues have historically been lower during the months of november through march 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of waste during the late fall  winter and early spring months primarily because i the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities decreases substantially during the winter months in the northeastern united states  and ii decreased tourism in vermont  maine and eastern new york during the winter months tends to lower the volume of waste generated by commercial and restaurant customers  which is partially offset by the winter ski industry 
since certain of the company s operating and fixed costs remain constant throughout the fiscal year  operating income results are therefore impacted by a similar seasonality 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions could result in increased operating costs to certain of the company s operations 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company establishes its expenditure levels based on its expectations as to future revenues  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
due to a variety of factors including general economic conditions  governmental regulatory action  acquisitions  capital expenditures and other costs related to the expansion of operations and services and pricing changes  it is possible that in some future quarter  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such events  the company s class a common stock price would likely be materially and adversely affected 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of the company s contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
the company therefore believes it should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require the company to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
the company s business is located in the northeastern united states 
therefore  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
the company is unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
year issues the approach of the year has raised concerns about the ability of information technology systems and non information technology systems  primarily computer software programs  to properly recognize and process date sensitive information with respect to the year the company has undertaken a year project  comprised of four phases  to address these concerns 
phase one  which has been completed  consisted of awareness  year planning  preparing a written plan  management approval and support 
phase two involved the evaluation of all systems and equipment  including hardware  software  security and voice mail  with respect to year compliance 
the completion date for phase two was june  phase three involves addressing any deficiencies identified in phase two  and the anticipated completion date is july  phase four involves the validation and testing of all systems and equipment  and the anticipated completion date is august  the company has performed  and continues to perform routine updates of all software and hardware systems to facilitate year compliance 
the company has completed numerous acquisitions in recent months  and the information systems of a limited number of these acquired operations have not yet been fully integrated with the company s information systems 
this integration of the completed acquisitions is expected to occur by july  the company continues to make acquisitions as an integral component of its growth strategy 
there is no assurance that the information systems of all acquired operations  particularly those acquisitions completed in the latter portion of calendar  will be year compliant by december  the company uses well regarded nationally known software vendors for both its general accounting applications and industry specific customer information and billing systems  and all internal productivity software 
the company has been informed by the respective vendors that all application software is fully year compliant 
the company s banking arrangement is with an international banking institution which has informed the company that it is taking all necessary steps to insure its customers uninterrupted service throughout applicable year time frames 
the company s payroll is out sourced by the largest provider of third party payroll services in the country  which has made a commitment of uninterrupted service to their customers throughout applicable year time frames 
the company is currently in the process of replacing all older personal computers and servers 
there are two servers and additional personal computers that will be replaced  of which will be for the weight measurement systems 
the two servers will be replaced within the first quarter of fiscal ending july  
the company has identified a vendor for the weight measurement systems and is in the final stage of evaluating its software offering 
the company anticipates implementing the product within three months of acceptance of it  which the company expects will be in the first quarter of fiscal the company currently plans a final testing of all systems in the second quarter of fiscal ending october  and expects to be fully year compliant by the end of that fiscal quarter 
the company has expended approximately million dollars over the last eighteen months to address hardware and software related year compliance issues  principally through the implementation of a new frame network system 
a portion of this investment is attributable to integrating information systems of companies that the company has acquired 
once the company has finished negotiations with the weight measurement vendor  the company will be able to determine the remaining budget requirements for the year compliance project 
the company will use funds from current operations or the company s line of credit to meet year remediation expenses 
no single customer represents more than one percent of the company s revenues  and we do not expect any material adverse effect on the company s revenues in the event an individual customer experiences year problems 
in addition  the company does not believe the year noncompliance of the company s suppliers of goods and services  other than as specifically discussed above  would have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
accordingly  the company has not sought assurances of year compliance from these other vendors 
the company expects to begin its evaluation of its most reasonably likely worst case scenarios with respect to the year in the second quarter of fiscal based upon the results of that evaluation  the company will determine an appropriate contingency plan  which the company believes would be implemented in the second and third quarters of fiscal adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents operating income earnings before interest and taxes  or ebit plus depreciation and amortization expense and loss on impairment of long lived assets 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  but is provided because the company understands that certain investors use this information when analyzing the financial position and performance of the company 
fiscal year ended april  restated in thousands operating income    depreciation and amortization    loss on impairment of long lived assets  adjusted ebitda    ebitda as a percentage of revenues see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
analysis of the factors contributing to the change in ebitda is included in the discussions above 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the company is party to an agreement and plan of merger with kti  inc there can be no assurance that the merger will take place on the anticipated timetable  if at all  or if it does  that management will be able to integrate kti s operations effectively into the company and that the merger will result in the synergies and other benefits anticipated by the two companies 
in connection with the merger with kti  the company will be required to obtain a new credit facility within days following the earlier of the closing of the merger or august  although the company is in the process of negotiating a new credit facility  there can be no assurance that it will obtain such a credit facility in the amount  or on the timetable  sought by the company 
in the event that it is unable to obtain a sufficient credit facility  the company would be required to repay its current credit facility 
the company does not have sufficient funds to repay the outstanding balance of the existing credit facility in the event a new credit facility is not obtained on a timely basis 
if the company cannot obtain a new credit facility on favorable terms within the required time period its acquisition program  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
the company s objective is to continue to grow by expanding its services in markets where it can be one of the largest and most profitable fully integrated solid waste services companies 
such growth  if it were to occur  could place a significant strain on the company s management and operational  financial and other resources 
the company has incurred net losses in the past 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in the future 
the company s strategy envisions that a substantial part of the company s future growth will come from making acquisitions consistent with its strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and  once identified  to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to the company  or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the company 
certain of these acquisitions may be of significant size and may include assets that are outside the company s geographic territories or are ancillary to the company s core business strategy 
the company is highly dependent upon the services of the members of its senior management team  the loss of any of whom may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company s future success depends on its continuing ability to identify  hire  train  motivate and retain highly trained personnel 
the company anticipates that any future business acquisitions will be financed through cash from operations  borrowings under its bank line of credit  the issuance of shares of the company s class a common stock and or seller financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient existing capital resources or will be able to raise sufficient additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all  in order to meet its capital requirements 
the company s operating program depends on its ability to operate and expand the landfills it owns and leases and to develop new landfill sites 
several of the company s landfills are subject to local laws purporting to regulate their expansion and other aspects of their operations 
there can be no assurance that the laws adopted by municipalities in which the company s landfills are located will not have a material adverse effect on the company s utilization of its landfills or that the company will be successful in obtaining new landfill sites or expanding the permitted capacity of any of its current landfills once its remaining disposal capacity has been consumed 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected by changing prices or market conditions for recycled materials 
the purchase and resale prices of and market demand for recycled materials has been and could continue to be volatile 
these changes in the past have contributed and may in the future continue to contribute to variability in the company s period to period results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is subject to interest rate fluctuation risk with regards to its variable rate revolving credit facility 
to modify the risk from these possible interest rate fluctuations  the company enters into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to the company s policies and procedures 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
on january  the company entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement the swap agreement with a bank 
the purpose was to effectively convert a portion of the company s interest rate exposure on advances under its revolving credit facility from a floating rate to a fixed rate until the expiration of the swap agreement 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the company s interest rate on the notional amount of  at per annum 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on the balance of its revolving line of credit balance which exceeds the swap amount of  based on the amount due on the company s line of credit at april   a increase in effective interest rates would reduce the company s net income before income taxes by  in addition  in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty  the company would be exposed to interest rate risk on the entire balance in the event the variable interest rate paid was to exceed the fixed rate paid under the terms of the swap agreement 
the remainder of the company s debt is at fixed rates and not subject to interest rate risk
