the interest rate under the credit facility is based  at the company s option  upon libor plus an applicable margin or the domestic base rate in the case of us dollar borrowings or the foreign base rate in the case of borrowings denominated in pounds sterling 
the domestic base rate is the greater of the rate publicly announced by first union national bank as its prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the foreign base rate is the publicly announced base rate of midland bank plc plus basis points 
the applicable margin for libor borrowings is based upon a matrix ranging from basis points to basis points  based upon the ratio of the company s most recently reported total indebtedness to pro forma adjusted ebitda 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries  and borrowings under the credit facility made by foreign subsidiaries of the company are secured by the assets of the foreign subsidiaries

year issues the company is currently in the process of addressing the year issue  which is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  computer applications and software may recognize an input of two zeros as the year this incorrect date recognition could cause systems and software malfunctions that may have a material adverse effect on business operations 
this potential problem could affect not only the company s internal information systems but also those of third parties  such as clients and vendors using information systems that may interact with or affect the company s operations 
company s readiness 
to ensure minimal business interruption due to computer failures  the company has performed a review of various software applications and computer infrastructure that are likely to be affected by the year issue 
both it systems and non it systems were reviewed 
it systems refer to all pre packaged and internally developed software applications and programs and related computer hardware 
non it systems refer to various equipment and devices that have embedded computer language  examples of which are computer integrated circuits chips and telephone switches 
the review was completed using the company s employees and various computer consulting vendors 
the company s response is being conducted in phases 
first  all relevant computer systems were assessed as to functionality and to determine year compliance 
second  for those systems and software found to be non compliant or in need of upgrading  corrective steps are being and will be taken 
corrective steps primarily relate to development and purchasing of system software and hardware 
finally  all systems will be tested and then implemented at necessary levels 
the company has substantially completed the corrective phase and is transitioning into the testing and implementation phase 
the company s objectives are to complete substantially all remediation and replacement of internal information systems by june  and to complete final testing and certification for year readiness by september the company presently believes that  with planned conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the company has identified its significant clients and vendors that it believes  at this time  to be critical to the company s business operations 
steps are underway to ascertain their respective stages of readiness through the use of questionnaires  interviews  and other available means to determine the progress that those clients and vendors are making in remediating their own year issues 
the company is requiring that significant clients and vendors certify those products and services to be year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that the information systems provided by or utilized by other companies which affect the company s operations will be timely revised in such a way as to allow them to continue normal business operations or furnish products  services or data to the company without disruption 
cost of compliance 
the company is replacing its non compliant systems 
preliminary estimates for these new systems are in the range of to million 
to date  the company has incurred approximately million of this estimated cost 
the company expects the majority of the remaining capital expenditures to be incurred by the third quarter of the company s year project costs are not expected to have a material impact on its results of operation or financial condition 
company risk and contingency plans

the company expects these replacements to be substantially completed by year end if needed conversions to the company s information systems are not made on a timely basis or the company s significant clients or vendors fail to make such remediations and conversions on a timely basis  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
a substantial amount of the company s revenues are received  and operating costs are incurred  in foreign currencies primarily the british pound and the german deutsche mark  with a significant amount of operating income being derived from operations in the united kingdom and germany 
the denomination of foreign subsidiaries account balances in their local currency exposes the company to certain foreign exchange rate risks 
the company addresses the exposure by financing most working capital needs in the applicable foreign currencies 
the company does not engage in hedging transactions to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the company has been insignificant 
interest rate risk 
the company maintains a credit facility and it has a subordinated convertible debenture  an interest rate swap agreement and other long term debt which subjects the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
the company s five year credit facility had a balance outstanding at december  of million  which was at a variable rate of interest 
in order to hedge against increasing interest rates  effective october   the company entered into a four year interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of approximately million to offset a portion of the floating interest rate risk 
the fair value of the swap agreement at december  approximates the value when entered into in october thus  if the company were to unwind the swap agreement  no material gain or loss would be recognized 
a change in the prevailing interest rates of would result in a change in the total fair value of long term debt of approximately million 
fair values were determined from discounted cash flows 
the carrying amount of the million subordinated convertible debenture is considered to be at fair value as of december   as it was repaid at the face amount with a portion of the january equity offering proceeds
