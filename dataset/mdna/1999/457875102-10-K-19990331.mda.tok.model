item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion in this section contains forward looking information that is subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  expressed or implied by such forward looking information 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect future results above 
among these risks are legislative acts  weather conditions  changes in the market value of salvage  outcome of litigation  competition  quality and quantity of inventory available from suppliers  and dependence on key insurance company suppliers 
overview the company offers insurance companies and other vehicle suppliers cost effective salvage processing solutions through a variety of different methods of sale  including percentage of sale consignment  fixed fee consignment and purchase agreement 
under the purchase agreement sales method  the vehicle is owned by the company and the sales price of the vehicle is recorded in revenue 
under the fixed fee and percentage of sale consignment sales methods  the vehicle is not owned by the company and only the fees associated with the processing and sale of the vehicle are recorded in net sales 
by assuming some of the risk inherent in owning the salvage vehicle instead of selling on a consignment basis  the company is potentially able to increase profits by improving the value of the salvage vehicle prior to the sale 
the percentage of sale consignment method offers potentially increased profits over fixed fee consignment by providing incentive to both the company and the salvage provider to invest in vehicle enhancements thereby maximizing the vehicle selling prices 
under the purchase agreement method  iaa generally pays the insurance company a pre determined percentage of the actual cash value acv to purchase the vehicle  pursuant to the purchase agreement 
acv s are the estimated pre accident fair value of a vehicle  adjusted for additional equipment  mileage and other factors 
until the significant rise in used car prices and acv s from to  the conversion from consignment sales to purchase agreement sales generally benefited the company 
during this period  however  used car prices and acv s rose significantly 
despite the increase in used car prices and acv s  prices at salvage auctions did not increase correspondingly 
because the company s purchase price is fixed by contract  the increased acv s can and has reduced profitability on the sale of vehicles under the purchase agreement method 
the company has renegotiated most of its purchase agreement contracts and seeks to renegotiate certain others 
the company has added adjustment and risk sharing clauses to its new standard purchase agreement contracts designed to provide some protection to the company and its customers from certain unexpected  significant changes in the acv salvage price relationship 
since its initial public offering  the company has grown primarily through a series of acquisitions to now include locations as of december  in february of  the company acquired auto disposal company  inc which operated two pools in alabama 
the company also added a site in northern california in the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations  including quarterly fluctuations  that can result from a number of factors  some of which are more significant for sales under the purchase agreement method

direct operating expenses were  for the year ended december   versus  in  a increase 
this increase reflects a general increase in operating expenses and the funding commitment made by the company to identify  develop and pilot new services that will streamline the automobile total loss claims process  resulting in reduced costs for insurance companies

financial condition and liquidity at december   the company had current assets of  including  of cash and cash equivalents  current liabilities of  and working capital of  the  increase in working capital from december  primarily consisted of an increase in advance charges on vehicles in inventory reflecting strong vehicle assignments in the fourth quarter of these advance charges are recorded as receivables when vehicles are picked up and deducted from proceeds from vehicle sales remitted to the salvage providers

the company also spent  on acquisitions in the company currently leases most of its facilities and other properties 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and provide adequate working capital for operations for the next twelve months 
part of the company s plan is continued growth possibly through new facility start ups  acquisitions  and the development of new claims processing services 
at some time in the future  the company may require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available on favorable terms 
the company s operating results have not historically been materially affected by inflation 
recent developments effective december   the company entered into a national sales agreement with allstate insurance company allstate a shareholder of the company 
the agreement expired as of december  at allstate s invitation  the company submitted a proposal to provide automobile salvage services for allstate locations across the country 
allstate requested this proposal as part of a comprehensive review of allstate s automobile salvage disposition practices 
several other providers of automobile salvage services are believed to have submitted proposals to allstate 
allstate recently advised the company that it had decided to not award all of its salvage business to a single vendor at this time 
allstate further advised the company that it intends to conduct pilots at selected allstate locations of a single vendor approach for all of its salvage disposition needs  although it does not know if the pilots will result in the awarding of a single source contract 
although the company is not currently involved in the pilots  the company is continuing its efforts to offer allstate a single source salvage solution 
allstate indicated the pilots would not have a material impact on the volume of vehicles supplied to the company by allstate 
however  no assurance can be given as to the results of allstate s pilot of a single source solution or the interim impact on the volumes of vehicles supplied by allstate to the company 
under the original agreement  local allstate management was  as it continues to be in most allstate locations  ultimately responsible for deciding who will be the provider of automotive salvage services for their geographic area of responsibility 
as such  the company continues to work with local allstate management and personnel to meet allstate s customer service level requirements and intends to work aggressively to maintain and increase the amount of business it receives from allstate  as well as to maintain the profitability of that business 
however  no assurance can be given as to the results of these efforts and the company may receive less  or less profitable business from allstate than it currently does 
volumes of vehicles received from allstate has decreased from  units in to  units in  part of which was due to the termination by the company of unprofitable purchase agreement contracts 
given the above  and the significant decline in the volume of vehicles received from allstate  the company is reviewing all aspects of its relationship with allstate 
the company intent has been and continues to be to maintain a profitable relationship with allstate 
however  no assurances can be given in this matter 
a significant reduction in allstate business could have a material  adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company undertook an initiative  the project  in mid  the objective of which is to determine and assess the risks of the year issue  and plan and institute mitigating actions to minimize those risks 
the project team is being led by the company s senior vice president and chief financial officer 
the scope of the project includes both it based systems and non it systems 
modifications required to bring the company s it systems into year compliance were identified by the project team 
based on work completed by the project team  the company does not believe its non it system year compliance issues represent a significant risk to the company 
the required modifications to the company s standard transaction processing system esps have been completed 
based on the findings of the project team and the successful implementation of these required modifications  the company believes this system is currently year compliant in all material respects 
however  certain of the company s operations have yet to be converted from non year compliant legacy systems currently in use to esps 
these operations are scheduled for conversion by october   although no assurances can be given the conversion will be completed on schedule 
failure to convert these operations on a timely basis could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company may be impacted by the effect the year issue has on the ability of the company s insurance customers to process automobile claims and state departments of motor vehicles dmv s to process titles on a timely basis 
any delay in the timely processing of automobile claims that significantly reduces the number of units the company has available for sale would have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition  the company relies on state dmv s to timely process titles to vehicles 
because the company must generally obtain title prior to selling a vehicle  a significant delay in title processing would impact the company s ability to sell vehicles from inventory and have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company has been  and will continue to be  in communication with its principal insurance customers and the dmv s with regard to their year readiness 
none of the responses received to date suggests there will be any interruption in their operations which would have a material adverse impact on the company although there can be no assurances given in this regard 
contingency plans will be completed during the second quarter of the cost to the company of dealing with the year issue is not expected to be material 
although a portion of the time of it personnel and related management has been and will be employed in evaluating the problem  taking corrective actions and preparing contingency plans  the company does not believe other it projects or operations have been or will be adversely affected 
costs of review  analysis and corrective action are expected to total less than item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had approximately  of short term investments as of december  these investments largely consisted of state government obligations and had either variable rates of interest or stated interest rates ranging from to 
the company s short term investments are exposed to certain market risks inherent with such assets 
this risk is mitigated by the company s policy of investing in securities with high credit ratings and investing through major financial institutions with high credit ratings 
the company has senior notes payable of  at an interest rate of 
the terms of the note agreement are such that pre payment of such debt may not be advantageous to the company in the event that funds may be available to the company at a lower rate of interest
