item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company generates revenues primarily from sales of ivd imaging systems based on its patented and proprietary aim technology 
following the initial sale  these systems become part of the installed base and generate follow on sales of supplies and service necessary for their operation 
the company also generates revenues from sales of ancillary lines of small laboratory instruments and supplies 
until  the company generated most of its revenues from sales of just two models of the yellow iris urinalysis workstation and related supplies and services 
these two models differ mainly by their speed and price 
in  the company introduced a third model of the yellow iris  the model udx urine pathology system  which is a higher capacity automated urinalysis workstation designed especially for the high volume testing requirements of large hospitals and reference laboratories 
the company also began selling the powergene family of genetic analyzers in august after completing the acquisition the psi acquisition of the digital imaging business of perceptive scientific instruments  inc psi 
the company is currently seeking to enhance psi s revenue stream by adding dna probe kits for chromosome analysis to the powergene product line and may pursue this goal through internal research and development efforts or a strategic transaction with another company 
finally  in december  the company began distributing the iris sysmex uf urine cell analyzer in the united states under an existing agreement with sysmex corporation  its manufacturer 
sysmex has initiated contractual procedures in september for terminating the exclusive nature of the company s distribution rights to the uf based on allegations of inadequate performance 
the company disputed these allegations and entered into discussions with sysmex about the pricing and marketing of the uf those discussions did not resolve the matter 
sysmex is now asserting that it has the right to appoint additional distributors for the uf in north america 
the company disputes that sysmex has this right but expects that sysmex will attempt to appoint at least one additional distributor for north america in the near future 
the company is presently evaluating its alternatives and may take legal action if sysmex does in fact appoint an additional distributor 
the company cannot presently predict the impact of any attempt by sysmex to appoint an additional distributor or any resulting legal action taken by the company

results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  totaled million which is comparable to the prior year 
sales of ivd systems decreased to million from million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
revenues from sales of urinalysis systems decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or 
the decrease is due to a decline in domestic sales  partially offset by increased sales to an international distributor 
revenues from sales of the powergene line of genetic analyzers decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or 
the decrease relates primarily to the non recurrence of a record million multi system sale of genetic analyzers during the second  third and fourth quarters of last year  lower average selling prices in response to increased competition  partially offset by increased unit volumes 
sales of ivd system supplies and services increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the comparable period last year  primarily due to the larger installed base of the yellow iris ivd imaging systems 
sales of small instruments and supplies decreased to million from million  a decrease of  royalty and licensing revenue decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to differences in non recurring licensing fees received in the two years 
royalty and licensing revenue is expected to decrease in revenues from the urinalysis segment totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the prior year  an increase of  the net increase is due to increased revenues from supplies and service for the yellow iris which more than offset a decline in sales of the yellow iris instruments and a decline in licensing revenues 
revenues from the genetic analysis segment declined to million in as compared to million in the prior year for the reasons described above 
revenues from the small laboratory devices segment were essentially comparable as increased licensing revenues were substantially offset by reduced purchases by a major distributor 
cost of goods for ivd systems increased as a percentage of their sales to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to lower average selling prices of the yellow iris urinalysis workstations caused by an increased proportion of international sales and lower average sales prices relating to the powergene genetic analyzer 
cost of goods for ivd system supplies and services as a percentage of sales of such products decreased to for the current period as compared to for the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to decreased costs and increased selling prices 
cost of goods for small instruments and supplies as a percentage of sales of small instruments and supplies totaled for compared to for the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to a change in the sales mix 
the net result of these changes was a decrease in aggregate gross margin to for  as compared to in the prior year 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues from the urinalysis segment totaled in  as compared to in lower average selling prices for the yellow iris workstation to an international distributor were partially offset by improved pricing and decreased costs on supplies and service 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues from the genetic analysis segment totaled in  as compared to in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of lower average selling prices due to the non recurrence of the multi system order discussed above and price pressures from increased competition 
cost of goods for the small instrument devices segment as a percentage of revenues totaled in and marketing and selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related travel expenses of the company s direct sales force  as well as salaries for the marketing and distributor relations departments 
marketing and selling expenses totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior year  an increase of  or 
the increase is primarily due to increased promotion of the powergene genetic analyzers 
marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues amounted to in and in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll costs associated with the company s management and support personnel  facilities related costs and legal and accounting fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million  an increase of  or over the prior year primarily due to expansion of the office of the chief executive  severance expenses and charges associated with the repricing of options held by consultants 
these increases were partially offset by lower legal and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues totaled in and net research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the development of new products and improvements to existing products less third party reimbursements under joint development programs  grants and research and development contracts 
net research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  an increase of  or  due to increased expenditures and decreased external funding under joint development programs 
net research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues amounted to in and in reimbursements under joint development programs decreased to  from million 
total product technology expenditures  including capitalized software development costs and reimbursed costs under research and development grants and contracts  totaled to million which is comparable to the prior year 
amortization of intangible assets reflects the amortization of deferred expenses for warrants issued in connection with joint development projects and intangible assets arising from acquisitions and patents 
amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or from the prior period 
the decline is primarily the result of the write off in the fourth quarter of of goodwill from the digital refractometer product line acquired in the results of operations for the year ended december  include unusual charges of  relating primarily to legal expenses for a pending arbitration matter 
see legal proceedings 
the unusual charges in the prior year totaled million and related primarily to the write off of deferred private offering expenses  goodwill no longer considered recoverable associated with the digital refractometer product line and legal expenses 
the net result of the above described changes was an increase in operating income to  in as compared to  in the prior year 
for the year ended december   urinalysis segment profits increased to million as compared to million in the prior year  an increase of  or 
this increase is largely attributable to increased sales of related supplies and service described above  partially offset by a small increase in operating expenses and lower system margins 
losses for the genetic analysis segment totaled million in as compared to losses of million in the prior year  an increase of  the increased loss is due primarily to the decrease in sales related to the non recurrence of the multi system sale discussed above and gross margins for this segment  as well as a modest increase in operating expenses 
segment profits from the small laboratory devices segment totaled million in as compared to  in the improvement is due to the increase in this segment s licensing revenues and the write off in of goodwill associated with the digital refractometer product line 
unallocated corporate expenses totaled million in as compared to million in the prior year  a decrease  of  this is due to decreased unusual charges for deferred offering costs and legal expenses as described above 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  totaled  as compared to an income tax benefit of  for the income tax benefit for the year ended december  differs from the federal statutory rate due to state  local and foreign income taxes and permanent differences between income reported for financial statement and income tax purposes 
the above factors contributed to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss per diluted share is due primarily to an imputed dividend on the series a preferred stock in in early the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec staff announced a new position on accounting for convertible preferred stock which is potentially convertible at a discount to the market price of the common stock  even if the potential for a discount is only a possibility 
the sec staff has taken the position  that solely for purposes of calculating earnings per share the potential discount is an imputed dividend to the preferred stockholders  which reduces the amount of earnings available to common stockholders 
accordingly  the issuance of the series a preferred stock resulted in a one time reduction in earnings available to common shareholders of  or per share in first quarter of the staff s position is limited to the calculation of earnings per share and did not have any effect on the company s net income or cash flow

cash provided by operations for the year ended december  decreased to  from million for the prior year 
this decline is primarily due to an increase in cash operating expenses  a decrease in gross margins  increases in accounts receivable caused by a shift in the timing of system sales  an increase in inventories and an increase in long term sales type leases not sold to a third party 
these increases were partially offset by increases in accounts payable 
cash used by investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to  in the prior year

the fda cleared the white iris leukocyte differential analyzer in may  but its commercial release was subsequently delayed by other priorities such as the introductions of the model udx urine pathology system and the uf urine cell analyzer 
the company has elected not to launch the white iris at the present time due to limited resources and the potential impact of product launch costs on near term profitability 
the company plans to explore strategic alternatives for the white iris program and therefore cannot reasonably estimate any impact on the recoverability of the capitalized costs associated with the product line  principally capitalized software and inventory 
if the company is unable to develop a viable strategic alternative for the program and as a result abandons the product line  it would incur a charge against future earnings of up to million for the related amounts capitalized 
in september  the company and poly u a systems inc  a company sponsored research and development entity  entered into a joint development project for the development of several new products to enhance automated urinalysis using the company s technology 
poly ua funded most of the cost of the project with the net proceeds from a private placement of units  each unit consisting of shares of poly ua common stock and warrants to purchase common stock of the company 
the company contributed  toward the cost of the project 
during  the company and poly ua satisfied their funding commitment on this project  and no further development work is planned at this time 
the company had an option until november  to acquire all of the common stock of poly ua for an aggregate price of million  payable in cash or shares of the company s common stock 
the company decided not to exercise its option but entered into ongoing discussions to acquire poly ua at a price below the option price 
the company cannot predict whether these discussions will lead to mutually acceptable terms for an acquisition 
if the company acquires poly in a negotiated transaction  it may result in a charge against then current earnings and additional dilution to common stockholders 
the company has outstanding  shares of series a convertible preferred stock preferred stock 
each share of preferred stock is convertible into a number of shares of common stock equal to i its  liquidation value divided by ii a variable conversion price 
the conversion price equals the lower of a per share or b of the average closing bid price of the common stock for the five consecutive trading days preceding the conversion but in no event less than 
assuming conversion prices of and per share  the preferred stock is convertible into approximately  and  shares of common stock  respectively 
based on the average closing price of for the five day period ending march   the conversion price would be the minimum of  and the preferred stock would convert into  shares of common stock 
any unconverted shares of preferred stock will automatically be converted into common stock on december  the preferred stock is non voting  is not entitled to any preferred dividends and is not subject to any mandatory or optional redemption provisions 
the company may not pay cash dividends on the common stock or repurchase any shares of the common stock without the written consent of the holder of the preferred stock 
year problem the year yk problem arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to recognize a year 
therefore  when the year arrives  these programs may not properly recognize a year beginning with instead of the familiar 
the yk problem may result in the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other microprocessor controlled equipment as the year is approached and reached 
state of readiness the company has divided its review of yk problems into three major areas internal systems  company products  including components supplied by outside vendors  and potential yk problems associated with outside vendors 
the company has focused most of its yk efforts on internal systems because it believes this area could be its primary source of yk problems 
the company s internal computer systems are the foundation for its business operations and include such critical functions as order entry  shipping  purchasing  inventory control  manufacturing  accounts receivable  accounts payable and the general ledger 
the company has completed a review of these critical systems and has determined that they are not yk compliant 
these systems are supported by third parties who currently have software updates available at reasonable prices 
the company has purchased and installed these updates 
although the vendors have certified the updates as yk compliant  the company plans to test the updates on its systems by june  the company is also in the process of reviewing other equipment that contains date sensitive information 
the company expects to complete its review of all other internal systems by june  and does not expect this review to uncover a risk of a material adverse effect on its operations from yk problems in this area 
the company has reviewed its products and has determined that the ivd imaging systems produced by the urinalysis and genetics segments have date sensitive fields or components that have date sensitive fields 
based on completed verification and validation testing and  if applicable  certificates received from third party vendors  the company has concluded that all the genetic segment ivd imaging systems  the unattended urinalysis ivd imaging system the model udx urinalysis workstation and the uf urine cell analyzer are yk compliant 
the company has also determined that there are no date sensitive fields contained in the products of the small instruments segment 
the company has determined that the unattended ivd imaging systems produced by the urinalysis segment models bravo    and urinalysis workstations have date sensitive fields 
the company has completed work on the software updates to make these products yk compliant  including verification and validation of these software updates 
the company expects to be distributing these software updates by april  the company has completed a review of outside vendor s products that interface with the company s and has determined that the company s products need no further modification to interface with the products of these vendors 
the company is also in the process of identifying any potential yk problems from other outside vendors whose systems interface with the company s internal systems 
the company expects to complete this review by june  based on a preliminary review of the yk problem associated with outside vendors  the company does not expect this issue to have a material adverse effect on its operations 
however  since third party yk compliance is not within the company s control  the company cannot assure stockholders that yk problems affecting the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
costs to address the yk issue costs to address the yk problem include hardware  software  and implementation costs for internal work and outside consultants and are estimated at  to date  the company has incurred approximately  of these costs  the majority of which have been expensed 
the company estimates that the cost to complete its yk work at less than  most of which will relate to completing the verification and validation of yk software updates for the ivd imaging systems for its urinalysis segment 
risks presented by the year issue to date  the company has not identified any yk problem that it believes could materially adversely affect the company or for which a suitable solution cannot be timely implemented 
however  as the review of its interfaces with other outside vendors progresses and the verification and validation of changes made to the urinalysis segment s unattended ivd imaging systems is completed  it is possible that yk problems may be identified that could result in a material adverse effect on its operations 
also  the company s credit facility with foothill capital corporation requires that it be yk compliant by october  if the company is unable to complete this work by that time  the company would have to seek a waiver or extension of this requirement 
the company cannot control yk planning and compliance by its customers and cannot predict the extent to which the yk problem will affect them in their business dealings with the company 
if customers are not adequately prepared for the yk problem  the subsequent crisis could temporarily divert their financial and management resources away from normal capital planning and temporarily depress sales of high priced instruments such as the yellow iris urinalysis workstations and the powergene genetic analyzers 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profits 
the yk problem may also have a material adverse effect on the company s cash flow if customer payments are delayed significantly due to yk problems in its customers accounting departments 
contingency plans although the company has not formulated a contingency plan to date  the company intends to continue to assess its yk risks to determine whether it needs to do so 
the company will develop a contingency plan if its implementation of internal systems  ongoing review of other outside vendors or verification and validation of the urinalysis segment unattended ivd imaging systems identify a yk problem that poses a significant risk to its business operations 
market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates the company relies significantly on long and short term fixed and variable rate debt in its capital structure 
the company does not use interest rate swaps to manage any of its floating rate debt obligations 
as of december   the company s debt obligations consisted of million outstanding under an fixed rate subordinated note  million outstanding under a variable rate term loan   outstanding under a variable rate revolving line of credit and  outstanding under fixed rate notes issued to a former strategic partner 
the variable rate obligations are based upon the lender s prime rate 
see liquidity and capital resources 
assuming an increase of one half of a percentage point in the lender s prime rate on january  and no principal payments for the remainder of the year  the company s total interest expense would increase by less than  for as compared to foreign currencies the company has a subsidiary in the united kingdom which conducts operations outside the americas 
the uk subsidiary purchases and sells products in various currencies 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign currency gains and losses  and the uk subsidiary is exposed to cost increases relative to local currencies in the markets in which it sells 
for  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which the uk subsidiary operates would not have been material 
the company is also subject to some currency risk on a portion of its licensing revenues 
this portion is calculated quarterly based on sales results in japanese yen and subsequently converted into united states dollars at the then current exchange rate 
inflation the company does not foresee any material impact on its operations from inflation 
healthcare reform policies in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  nationally  at the state level or both 
future legislation  regulation or payment policies of medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors could adversely affect the demand for the company s current or future products and its ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
moreover  healthcare legislation is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and the company cannot predict future legislative changes in the healthcare field or their impact on its business 
forward looking statements the foregoing discussion  as well as the other sections of this annual report on form k  contain various forward looking statements which reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial results and are subject to the safe harbor created by that private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the company s views with respect to future financial results  financing sources  capital requirements  market growth  new product introductions and the like  and are generally identified by phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans and words of similar import 
the company reminds stockholders that forward looking statements are merely predictions and therefore inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statement 
these uncertainties and other factors include  among other things  i the ability of the company to secure additional financing to repay the remaining principal balance of its long term debt and to fund its long term business strategy  ii unexpected technical and marketing difficulties inherent in the introduction of sophisticated  capital intensive new medical instruments  iii the potential need for changes in the company s long term strategy in response to future developments  iv future advances in diagnostic testing methods and procedures  as well as potential changes in government regulations and healthcare policies  both of which could adversely affect the economics of the diagnostic testing procedures automated by the company s products  v rapid technological change in the microelectronics and software industries  vi increasing competition from imaging and non imaging based in vitro diagnostic products and vii difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and product lines 
the company has attempted to identify additional significant uncertainties and other factors affecting forward looking statements elsewhere in this annual report
