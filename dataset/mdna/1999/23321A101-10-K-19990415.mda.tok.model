see introductory note on page hereof 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled additional factors that may affect future operating results in item above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
all information is based on the company s fiscal calendar 
results of operations net sales 
the company had net sales of  in   in and  in management believes that the increase in sales is due to an expanded customer base resulting from an increase in the company s direct sales personnel 
management believes  however  that the sales increase was limited by the continued asian market softness 
although sales in the pacific rim have historically been less than ten percent of total revenue  the company was expecting an increase in revenue from this geographic area 
the general sales cycles for distribution of the company s products are similar to those of most businesses selling products designed for use as part of large systems  and range from three to six months for value added resellers var and small system integrators and from one to two years for original equipment manufacturers oem  product integrators and large system integrators 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  was approximately in  in and in the company s relatively low gross margins reflect the company s low sales volumes  which have resulted in unabsorbed manufacturing costs and high costs of materials due to the inability to achieve purchasing economies of scale due to low sales volume 
the company expects that  as product sales continue to increase  costs of sales per unit of product will decrease because fixed manufacturing costs will be distributed over the larger sales volume  and material costs will decrease as the result of volume purchases 
the company also expects that its recently introduced orion series of products will increase the company s overall margins 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  in   in and  in the primary reason for the decrease in expenses in as compared to were decreases in expenses related to the orion project  which was substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of the primary reason for the increase in expenses as compared to was an increase in project material related to the orion product line 
the company believes that research and development expenses will increase moderately in due to current projects under development 
marketing and sales expenses 
marketing and sales expenses were  in   in and  in the primary reason for the increase from to was the expansion of the company s direct sales personnel 
the decrease in as compared to was due to a reduction in marketing management headcount 
although expenses were relatively flat over the three year period ended december   the company believes that in marketing and sales expenses will increase in connection with the company s continued efforts to broaden market acceptance of its products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  in   in and  in the increase in expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a return to the employee headcount level of fiscal liquidity and capital resources during  and  the company used   and  respectively  primarily to fund operating losses 
in fiscal  the company raised  through the issuance of convertible preferred stocks 
at december   the company had a cash balance of approximately  in addition  the company has a commitment from its largest investor to invest up to  if needed 
the company believes this committed future investment  together with borrowing from a credit line with a financial institution  which allows it to borrow the lesser of  or of eligible receivables see note to the notes to financial statements for a further description of the credit line  and cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements at least through the end of  although the company anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
the ability to sustain its operations for a significant period after december   will depend on the company s ability to significantly increase sales or raise significant additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to the company 
there is no assurance that any of these conditions will be achieved 
in particular  the company expects to require increasing amounts of cash to finance the company s efforts to increase sales  which the company plans to achieve by increasing selling efforts to large system integrators and oems by hiring additional sales and sales support staff and by making evaluation units available 
in addition  the company intends to expand its current network of resellers 
the company may require cash to finance purchases of inventory to satisfy anticipated increased sales as the company s products achieve market acceptance 
although the company has not committed to make any material capital expenditures as of december   the budget for capital equipment expenditures for is approximately  the majority of these purchases are expected to be in the areas of process and molding tooling to reduce cost and improve producibility of the company s products 
the terms of the series c preferred stock and outstanding warrants may limit the availability of financing for the company  particularly equity financing 
holders of series c preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends in the amount of approximately  per year 
the company has never paid cash dividends and has no present plans to pay dividends 
impact of year the company is taking steps to prepare its internal systems for the year date change 
certain of the company s business operations software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those software programs are time sensitive and recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including but not limited to  a temporary inability to sell or deliver products  process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities and increased costs 
the company has been informed by the vendor of the business operations software used by the company that upgrades that will bring such software into year compliance are available and will be provided to the company under its existing software maintenance agreement 
the company expects to effect this upgrade of its internal business operations software by the end of the second quarter of the company estimates that the cost of the conversion will be approximately  although the company does not believe that it will incur any material costs or experience material disruptions in its business associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which are composed of third party software  third party hardware that contains embedded software and the company s own software products 
the company sells certain products that include various software applications  and the company intends to distribute software designed to remediate potential year problems for certain of its older products 
however  the company believes that the software components of its products  which are self contained software programs that run independently of external chronology  will not be significantly affected by the year issues 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s current products and software will be year ready in all environments or that any remedial software will adequately address year problems 
the company is also in the process of requesting assurance from its goods and services providers that they are  or have programs in place to be  year compliant 
the company s costs to date for its year compliance program  excluding the salaries of the employees  has not been material 
although the company has not completed its assessment  it does not currently believe that the future costs associated with its year compliance program will be material 
the company established a year steering committee which reports directly to the president and chief executive officer 
the committee members include executive management and employees with expertise from various disciplines including  but not limited to  information technology  engineering  finance  customer service  sales  communications  facilities  procurement and human resources 
the committee is responsible for addressing year issues associated with the company s business application systems including  but not limited to  the company s customer service  operations and financial systems and end user applications  embedded systems  including equipment that operates such items as the company s telecommunications and facilities  software applications embedded in certain of the company s products  vendor and supplier relationships  and contingency planning 
the company currently believes that neither the software developed by it as part of its products  nor the software licensed by it for its internal use  will be materially affected by the year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s product software  its internal computer systems and networks or those of its key vendors  developers and distributors will not be affected by such year issues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company also has implemented a program to assess the possible effects on its operations of the year readiness of key suppliers and vendors and is in the process of receiving information concerning the suppliers and vendors year status 
the company s reliance on suppliers and vendors and  therefore  on the proper functioning of their information systems and software  means that their failure to address year issues could have a material effect on the company s operations and financial results 
the company anticipates completing its assessment by the end of the third quarter of based on the results of the assessment  the company may identify alternative suppliers and vendors 
the effect that the year will have on information technology spending patterns is uncertain at this time 
the potential adverse consequences resulting from year concerns could include  among others  decreased spending on new information storage systems during as customers complete their year testing activities and delays in customer purchase decisions once customers have verified the year readiness of their information systems 
the demand for the company s products could be adversely affected in the event these patterns were to materialize  which could have an adverse effect on the company s operating and financial results 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues  and the company is aware of a growing number of lawsuits relating to year issues 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by it 
the company is currently unable to determine its most reasonably likely worst case year scenario  as it has not identified and assessed all of its systems  particularly its non it systems 
as the company completes its identification and assessment of internal and third party systems  it expects to develop contingency plans for various worst case scenarios 
the company expects to have such contingency plans substantially in place by september a failure to address year issues successfully could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations
