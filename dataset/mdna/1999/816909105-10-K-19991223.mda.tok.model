overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this document 
references to fiscal years are to years ended september the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas for fiscal the company s reportable segments have been determined based on the nature of its operations  products offered to customers and information used by the chief operating decision maker as defined by sfas for fiscal  the company s two reportable segments are semiconductor equipment and software control systems 
the semiconductor equipment segment is the company s largest segment and its primary products are capital equipment for semiconductor wafer surface preparation and cleaning  and electrochemical deposition of various metals on a wafer surface 
the manufacturing process for integrated circuits may include over several hundred steps and following many of those steps the silicon wafer surface must be cleaned  a deposited film stripped off the surface or the surface etched 
the semiconductor equipment segment s largest product line  surface preparation and cleaning equipment  can perform many of these steps 
the segment s electrochemical deposition products are used to deposit various types of metals on the surface of a wafer for varied applications including copper for interconnect 
the unit selling prices for this segment s products range from  to approximately million with some predominance of selling prices in the upper portion of the price range 
due to this predominance of relatively high unit selling prices  a significant portion of the company s revenue in any given period is often derived from the sale of a relatively small number of units 
the software control systems segment s primary product is a software control system comprised of a communication software interface coupled with equipment specific software modules to link most types of manufacturing equipment used in a semiconductor manufacturing facility fab front end process 
the unix based software system utilizing specially equipped computer workstations performs data collection  statistical process analysis and control  preventive maintenance scheduling  and process recipe management for either a single tool or multiple  networked tools 
the system can be integrated with a semiconductor manufacturer s computer integrated manufacturing system 
both of semitool s segments sell their products to semiconductor manufacturers worldwide and believe their sales  service and support organizations are important to the long term success of their customer relationships  particularly as customers increasingly demand equipment and integrated process solutions 
worldwide sales  service and support are primarily provided through company employees in the united states  europe  japan  korea  singapore  and taiwan with some limited use of independent sales representatives and distributors 
in fiscal  the company s sales distribution by geographical area was united states   europe   japan   and asia  including all others  compared to   and  respectively  for the prior year 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales  although the percentage of international sales and the geographical distribution may fluctuate from period to period 
from time to time  the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in its results of operations  particularly on a quarterly basis 
the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future sales 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet expectations  operating results will be adversely affected 
a variety of factors have an influence on the company s operating results in a particular period 
these factors include specific economic conditions in the semiconductor industry  the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  customer cancellations or delays of shipments  specific feature requests by customers  production delays or manufacturing inefficiencies  management decisions to commence or discontinue product lines  the company s ability to design  introduce and manufacture products on a cost effective and timely basis  the introduction of new products by the company or its competition  the selection of the company s or its competitors products by semiconductor manufacturers for new generations of facilities or expansions  the timing of research and development expenditures  exchange rate fluctuations  and expenses attendant to acquisitions  strategic alliances and further development of marketing and service capabilities 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended september  statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss net sales 
fiscal consolidated sales declined to million from last year s million and compares to million in fiscal the overall net sales decline in each of the past two years is primarily attributable to the reduction of capital equipment spending by the company s customers in response to excess manufacturing capacity in the semiconductor industry  the asian economic decline and  to a lesser extent  the effect of a shift of marketing and sales resources from the company s thermal products to other product lines with expected higher potential 
partially offsetting the sales decline from these factors in both years was a small increase in software control systems segment sales 
semiconductor equipment segment sales fell to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and that year was below fiscal the semiconductor equipment segment s product lines relative contribution to consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively  are surface preparation and cleaning  and  electrochemical deposition  and  and parts  service and other  and 
the fiscal segment sales decline is due to lower sales in all product lines which was primarily the result of the semiconductor industry downturn 
however  the sales decline in the company s thermal products  which is included in other  was greater due to a shift of marketing and sales resources away from that product line 
in fiscal  segment net sales were million below the prior year s sales 
that year s decrease was primarily attributable to the surface preparation and cleaning and thermal product lines sales decrease which was partially offset by increased sales of electrochemical deposition products and spare parts and service 
fiscal electrochemical deposition product sales for all metal types declined million from the prior year  but the percentage decline for this product line was significantly lower than the percentage decline of all other product lines in this segment 
electrochemical deposition sales for fiscal were million  up from million in fiscal essentially all of the fiscal sales increase was from sales of tools for copper plating applications 
software control systems segment sales for fiscal were million including intersegment sales of  fiscal segment sales  excluding intersegment sales  increased compared to the previous year s comparable sales increase of  which included a fab wide  front end system installation for one customer 
this year s sales increase is attributable to growing product acceptance and increasing market activity 
there is some industry expectation that foundries  manufacturers that produce semiconductors for companies that need additional manufacturing capacity or do not have fabs  will make significant capital investment in the next several years 
likewise  there is a similar industry expectation  that as the asia pacific economic conditions improve  capital investment will increase in that geographic area 
both of these market expectations  if they develop  may support a recovery in the semiconductor industry 
based on the current semiconductor market outlook  management expects fiscal year sales to exceed fiscal year s sales and that profitability will improve  although  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
consolidated orders backlog increased to approximately million at september   from approximately million at september   which had decreased from million at september  new order bookings were similar in total amount for both fiscal and  however  the timing of orders booked was reversed 
fiscal second half new order bookings were approximately million compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
at september  and  semiconductor equipment segment orders backlog represented and  respectively  of consolidated orders backlog 
the company includes in its backlog those customer orders for which it has written authorization and for which shipment is scheduled within the next twelve months 
orders are generally subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers with limited or no penalty 
as the result of systems ordered and shipped in the same quarter  possible changes in customer delivery schedule  cancellations  and shipment delays  the backlog at any particular date and the new orders bookings for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was  down from in fiscal and nearly unchanged from fiscal the decrease in gross margin in the current year is attributable to a number of factors  including the effect of lower operating levels and higher obsolete inventory write offs in the semiconductor equipment segment  and sales mix in both segments 
the fiscal increase in gross margin is attributable to a number of factors including the effect of efficiencies earlier in that year which were partially offset later in the year by excess capacity costs  lower material costs in the semiconductor equipment segment  and sales mix in both segments 
the company s gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including the costs to manufacture  service  and support new and enhanced products  as well as the mix and average selling prices of products sold 
the company anticipates that the cost to manufacture and support new products will improve over time  but it also expects to continue to design and sell additional models of its existing products and new products  which may adversely affect the anticipated improvement 
selling  general and administrative 
consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net sales in fiscal  down million in absolute dollars but up as a percent of sales from fiscal s million  or of net sales 
this absolute decline in sg a expense is the net result of overall lower semiconductor equipment segment sg a costs resulting from cost reductions and lower sales volumes which decreases were partially offset by higher legal expenses related to current litigation  and an increase in software control systems sg a costs due to higher sales and an expanded sales and support organization 
the fiscal million consolidated sg a expense increase from fiscal reflects primarily the full year effect of the company s decision to transition to a company staffed sales and customer support organization in most of the asian marketplace  the larger domestic and european customer service organization  and a fourth quarter million bad debt provision for an international receivable  all associated with the semiconductor equipment segment 
a substantial portion of the company s sg a expense is fixed in the short term 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist of salaries  project materials  laboratory costs  consulting fees  depreciation and other costs associated with the company s research and development efforts 
the company s consolidated research and development expenses in absolute dollars and as a percent of net sales for fiscal years  and were million  or  million or  and million or  respectively 
r d expense for fiscal was below fiscal s expense level which had increased from fiscal during these periods  projects in the semiconductor equipment segment included the development of the lt c linear copper plating tool  the development of the high throughput fully automated spectrum  the millennium platform with its unique capsule processing chamber  and the hydrozone cleaning process  among others 
additionally  the software control systems segment undertook a major product upgrade and expansion in fiscal  which is ongoing 
the semiconductor equipment segment s r d activities are focused on the surface preparation and cleaning and electrochemical deposition product lines 
the company is committed to technology leadership in the semiconductor equipment industry and expects to continue to fund research and development expenditures with a multiyear perspective 
such funding has resulted in fluctuations in r d expenses from period to period in the past 
the company expects such fluctuations to continue in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the timing of expenditures  changes in the level of net sales and the number of projects 
other income expense 
interest income on short term investment of cash balances was  in fiscal compared to  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
interest expense in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal the decline in interest expense in fiscal was due to lower average borrowings during the year in response to reduced operating levels 
interest expense is expected to increase in fiscal year in fiscal  other  net includes  from gains on sales of property and foreign currency exchange gains of million 
the foreign exchange gain consists of net gains and losses resulting from the re measurement of our accounts denominated in non us currencies into non us dollars  which is our functional currency  and net gains and losses on forward contracts 
the net exchange gain was due primarily to fluctuations of the us dollar against the japanese yen 
other expense in fiscal includes a  write off of capitalized costs associated with a canceled building project 
income taxes 
the fiscal income tax benefit  as a result of this year s loss  was million compared to the million provision for income taxes in fiscal the effective tax rates for fiscal years  and were  and respectively 
the company expects its effective tax rate to be for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million as compared to million generated by operations in fiscal in fiscal  cash was used in operations because of substantial increases in inventory  accounts receivable  income tax refund receivable  and a decrease in accrued warranty and installation partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
as of september   the company had million of accounts receivable and million of inventory  compared to million of accounts receivable and million of inventory at september  the company expects future accounts receivable and inventory balances to fluctuate with net sales 
as is customary in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry  products are generally built to fill specific customer orders  with typical order fulfillment times ranging from four to six weeks for certain products to six months or more for more complex products 
accordingly  while the company s finished goods inventory accounts for slightly over of total inventory  overall inventory levels tend to fluctuate with the level and type of orders received 
currently  the tools with the longest average cycle times are the semiconductor equipment segment s automated batch tools and single substrate processor 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was  compared to million used in fiscal the sale of property provided cash of million in fiscal and cash used to purchase plant  property and equipment declined from million in to million in major purchases of plant  property and equipment during include the purchase of a building for the software control systems segment operations 
investments in intangible assets used cash of  in fiscal compared to million cash used in fiscal which includes million for software control systems segment software development costs  which were capitalized once technological feasibility was reached  and  for patents and trademarks 
financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of million of additional net borrowings under the company s line of credit to fund operations 
as of september   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  million available under the company s million revolving line of credit  which was amended during the fourth quarter of fiscal the credit facility is with bank of america and bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate or libor plus 
the revolving line of credit expires on april  and all principal amounts owing are due by april  the credit agreement has various restrictive covenants  including a prohibition against pledging or in any way encumbering current or operating assets during the term of the agreement and the maintenance of various financial ratios 
the company believes that cash and cash equivalents  funds generated from operations  and funds available under its bank lines will be sufficient to meet the company s planned capital requirements during the next twelve months including the spending of approximately million to purchase property  plant and equipment 
the company believes that success in its industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
the company may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company may effect additional equity or debt financings to fund such activities or to fund greater than anticipated growth 
the sale of additional equity securities or the issuance of equity securities in a business combination could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
litigation in august   we filed suit against novellus systems  inc in the united states district court for the northern district of california case no 
c dlj  alleging infringement of two of our patents relating to single substrate processing tools used in electrochemical deposition of copper onto semiconductor wafers 
we seek damages for past infringement  a permanent injunction  treble damages for willful infringement  pre judgment interest and attorneys fees 
novellus answered the complaint by denying all allegations  counterclaiming for declaratory judgment of invalidity and non infringement 
discovery is continuing and no trial date has been set 
a lawsuit brought by mitsubishi silicon america corporation  successor to siltec corporation case no 
cv aa was filed on july  in the united states federal district court for the district of oregon against us 
the lawsuit alleges breach of warranties and seeks damages and attorney s fees in excess of million 
we believe the lawsuit to be without merit and are contesting the action vigorously 
however  given the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the stage of discovery  there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome will be in our favor 
further  regardless of the ultimate outcome  there can be no assurance that the diversion of management s attention  and any costs associated with the lawsuit  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and have not been finally adjudicated 
although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of these matters  it is the opinion of our management  based upon the information available at this time  that the currently expected outcome of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
this statement requires the company to disclose accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
prior period financial statements have been reclassified to reflect application of this statement 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for the company in fiscal the company has not yet determined the effect the adoption of this standard will have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
in march  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires companies to capitalize certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop is effective for the company in fiscal the company does not believe the application of this standard will have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
year our year yk readiness project is complete 
the project consisted of six major phases planning  assessment  testing  repairs reinstallations  and contingency planning 
the following areas went through each of the above phases products 
other than some spare parts  many of our products include software both internally developed and purchased from vendors 
some equipment also includes numerous sub systems with embedded software 
much of this software is customized to meet customers specific needs 
it system 
these systems include our business and manufacturing systems  computer aided design  e mail and others 
the majority of these systems were developed by software vendors  are not highly customized  and have been updated to yk compliant revisions per the vendor 
we performed end to end testing where we deemed such testing necessary and found no compliance issues 
non it systems 
these systems include but are not limited to controllers on machinery used in production  the heating and air conditioning systems  communication systems  and electronic security devices 
customers suppliers 
we worked with our customers and suppliers to determine yk readiness and insure that goods and services will be delivered timely and that transaction processing is proper 
we do have electronic data interface edi transactions with some customers  however  these edi transactions are provided by third parties who have certified their yk readiness 
contingency plans have been formulated in the event that significant yk compliance issues remain undetected 
these plans make the assumption that our major facilities continue to receive essential services such as electricity  natural gas  communications  sewer and water 
such assumptions are based on our vendor s assurances that these services will not be interrupted 
the plans do attempt to minimize damage to property in the event any of these services are unavailable 
the cost incurred thus far with regard to yk consists mainly of personnel costs for it  non it  product software and customers suppliers issues 
we do not track yk costs as a separate cost 
total estimated costs are not anticipated to exceed  all mission critical it systems have been tested and are believed to be yk ready  however  due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the yk issue  we cannot anticipate all of the possible problems that may occur 
adverse consequences from yk issues may materially effect our warranty liability  the value of our capitalized software and the carrying value of our inventory as well as our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the yk problems could also subject us to litigation which may include consequential damages 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity the company as of september  has approximately million in long term debt and approximately million in short term debt 
the company s long term debt bears interest at a fixed rate 
as a result  changes in the fixed rate interest market would change the estimated fair value of its fixed rate long term debt 
the company believes that a change in the long term interest rate would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s short term debt bears interest at a variable rate 
based on the million of short term debt outstanding as of september   a change in interest rates would not have a material affect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity all of our non us operations are subject to inherent risks in conducting business abroad  including fluctuation in the relative value of currencies 
we manage this risk and attempt to reduce such exposure through an economic hedge by entering into short term forward exchange contracts 
at september  we held forward contracts to purchase japanese yen with a face value of million  a market value of million and an unrealized loss of approximately  the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward foreign exchange contracts generally offsets the impact on related transactions denominated in yen 
the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on hedged transactions involving japanese yen forward exchange contracts and the underlying transactions would not be material to the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
