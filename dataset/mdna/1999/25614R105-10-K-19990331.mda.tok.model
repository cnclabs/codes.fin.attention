item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations entitled factors affecting future results and elsewhere in this report 
document sciences corporation develops  markets and supports a family of document automation software products and services used in high volume electronic publishing applications 
document automation has become increasingly important as more companies realize the benefits of automating the high volume production of individually customized documents that require the precise layout of information such as financial data  marketing text and graphs 
our document automation software  the document sciences autograph family of products  enables personalized and customized publishing solutions for many industries including insurance  managed healthcare  financial services  telecommunications  manufacturing distribution  government and commercial print services 
our products facilitate an important form of communication between organizations and customers by employing enterprise database assets to produce high quality documents that are ready to print on demand and distribute in high volume 
additionally  our core technology is being applied to provide electronic document automation solutions for the internet by leveraging the capabilities of adobe s widespread pdf technology 
document sciences autograph is licensed to more than customers worldwide who are collectively producing an estimated one billion customized pages per month 
the highly portable document sciences autograph software platform enables cost effective  just in time  on demand  high volume publishing that is fully automated  capable of quality document composition  and flexible for end user customization 
our products are used in a wide array of computing environments from client server to large computer systems 
products the document sciences autograph family of products currently addresses three major functional areas document composition and assembly  content management  and document viewing  as described below 
all of our software products can be complemented by our professional services organization 
historically  we have licensed our products for one year  after which an annual renewal fee  usually of the initial license fee  is required for continued use 
we are transitioning to a new sales model where we will offer perpetual licenses for our products  as well as three year subscription license terms  after which the license may be renewed for additional three year terms  or converted for perpetual use 
we will also provide three year maintenance agreements that are usually in an amount equal to  per year  of the subscription license fee 
the list price for a subscription license fee for compuset  our core product  is currently  for a mainframe installation and ranges down to  for a pc nt server installation 
options currently range from  to  a typical new sale is currently about  for software licenses and approximately  for professional services 
document composition and assembly composition and assembly 
compuset automates document composition and assembly using data and information in corporate databases 
compuset software consists of a rule based language and a composition engine that provides high speed composition and assembly of complex documents with high typographic and aesthetic levels of quality 
information content is marked with compuset tags which  in turn  are defined in logically separate style specifications 
without requiring real time user interaction  the composition engine then transforms the tagged data and information into finished electronic documents that can be composed and assembled at rates in excess of pages per second  depending on computing configuration and complexity of the document 
document construction facilities are extensive  including the full support of dynamic data driven graphics generation and full color 
compuset operates on a range of computers and operating systems including mainframes  unix platforms and pc nt servers 
data capture and setup 
data capture and setup products include the newly introduced data preparation tool  or dpt  and a number of importers 
these prepare data and content for subsequent composition and assembly by compuset 
dpt is an optional tool that enables users to capture and tag raw data and information from a variety of sources  including corporate databases  for subsequent processing by compuset 
it provides an easy to use graphical user interface  or gui  that describes the data environment  related data processing and the tagging instructions for compuset 
it then automatically generates a data preparation program in cobol that is compatible with mainframe cobol compilers  and acucorp s acucobol runtime products 
importers accept externally generated document objects  including text  static graphics and scanned images  and convert them into formats compatible with compuset 
the importers currently support xerox metacode  adobe postscript and the tiff standard for scanned images 
additional importer extensions for supporting additional ibm afpds format types are planned for introduction during document output and merge 
emitters transform compuset s output into a number of popular page description languages  or pdls  for printing and viewing 
the pdls provide instructions for rendering text  forms  bitmaps  and graphics into documents 
the emitters also condition the pdls for transport over a variety of high speed printing interfaces 
the pdl formats currently supported are xerox metacode  ibm afpds  hp pcl  adobe postscript  and adobe portable document format  or pdf 
this part of the architecture is extensible and new emitters can be developed as required 
application development tools 
visual compuset application development tools run on microsoft windows r and simplify document design and application prototyping 
visual compuset incorporates support for jetform r corporation s jetform design tool  the optional dpt and for the compuseries ii design environment 
compuseries ii consists of several integrated modules including a tool for defining document formatting rules 
formatting specifications  which are selected from a menu  are associated with tags which are referenced in the document data 
the results of the selected formatting specifications are visually displayed in a preview window 
visual compuset uses a pc version of compuset  combined with an editor to manipulate the tagged document data 
visual compuset supports all of the dynamic functions and features of the compuset production engine 
additional extensions to visual compuset are planned for introduction during content management content management tools provide client server solutions for the creation  revision and management of document components used in our document automation solutions 
they consist of the document library service  or dls  and desktop document manager  or ddm 
dls manages the document component creation process required by complex variable documents 
in addition  dls can be used to define complex assembly rules required for interactive or fully automated document composition and assembly with compuset 
dls uses a client server architecture for accessing data and files on a mainframe or network server 
ddm is the client component of dls and manages text objects created with microsoft word r 
text objects are tracked and managed in a multi author environment by providing access security  revision control and approval levels 
ddm also provides a criteria based document object selection capability for customized or personalized documents 
these criteria are then used by dls to generate a compuset ready tagged data file 
the customized or personalized document assembly can be directed to occur in a high volume fashion on the server or in a just in time  on demand fashion on the local ddm pc 
document viewing document viewing enables on line viewing and archiving of electronic documents produced by document automation applications 
it consists of document viewing service  or dvs  and compuview 
dvs uses a client server architecture for the creation and access of electronic document files 
dvs is available for a variety of mainframe  unix platforms  and pc nt servers 
the electronic document files are generated in a format called composite container format  or ccf  which is optimized for fast  memory efficient viewing  transport and storage 
ccf files can then be viewed by compuview 
ccf files consist of three major components a pdl rendition of the pages for wysiwyg viewing  various indices for locating documents and reusable document elements 
ccf files can also be distributed  archived or printed through document distribution and archiving systems offered by third party software developers that integrate compuview 
the view of the document is virtually identical to the printed document 
compuview may also be integrated with third party document archival and retrieval systems that support the ccf format 
we are considering possible future internet extensions  some of which are not currently under active development 
we believe that our core technology can be extended to the internet and intranets and we are continuing development activities in this area  although there can be no assurance that such development activity will result in commercially successful products 
see business research and development 
professional services in addition to our software products  we provide a comprehensive suite of professional services which can assist customers in the implementation of mission critical document automation applications 
professional services include on site software installation  customer training programs  telephone support programs and consulting services 
consulting services is currently focused on assisting in the sale of high margin initial software licenses by providing project management  requirements analysis  application design and application development services 
in addition to consulting services  we currently provide introductory level customer education with compuset  dls and dpt initial licenses 
additional and advanced classes are available for additional fees at our headquarters in san diego and at customer sites 
we believe that the use of our professional services enables customers to deploy our document automation products more rapidly and effectively 
the professional services and support organizations employed a staff of as of december  sales and marketing our sales and marketing organization targets vertical industry markets that require document automation and high volume document personalization and customization 
we currently license our products using a combination of direct sales and alternate channels 
in the united states  we market our products through a direct sales force 
sales representatives are provided with pre sales technical support by solution analysts 
sales representatives and solution analysts are located throughout the united states 
we distribute our products through value added resellers  or vars  such as xerox canada  ltd 
in canada  fuji xerox co  ltd 
in australia  and xerox brazil  ltd 
in brazil 
our subsidiary  document sciences europe  markets and supports our products in europe  africa and the middle east by providing channel management  technical support  consulting and training services  and by defining european market and product requirements 
we license our products in europe through vars and  to a lesser extent  direct sales 
the vars are principally xerox europe affiliates who remarket our products 
our revenues from export transactions with xerox affiliates were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the sales and marketing organization employed a staff of as of december  we intend to expand our sales and marketing organization to provide direct sales and support services throughout the world 
such planned expansion will occur by first addressing the unique product requirements of a region followed by developing indirect sales channels to market in the region 
as we are able to increase our market presence  we may then augment our alternate channels with a direct sales capability 
in addition  we intend to increase both our product offerings and markets through marketing  sales and distribution and development relationships with other companies 
current relationships include formal and informal marketing and sales alliances with xerox  ibm  new dimension software  rsd  jetform corporation  systemware and anacomp 
these relationships provide sales leads for our products and have extended our sales coverage and networking capabilities 
research and development in general  our strategy is to augment and extend the document composition and assembly capabilities of our core products 
initially  product development investments are primarily focused on completing the document sciences autograph family of products  which include delivering products for document viewing as well as adding support for additional print environments 
subsequently  there is a substantial investment in product maintenance  software integration  testing and documentation 
we supplement these product development efforts by reviewing customer feedback on existing products and working with customers and potential customers to anticipate future product needs 
to date  the document sciences autograph family of products has been applied mainly to document automation applications producing paper based documents 
we believe that our core technology can be extended to the internet  intranets and commercial on line services  and we have recently begun initial development activity in this area 
the short term strategy is to engage this emerging opportunity with two complementary initiatives 
we intend to work closely with existing customers to define product requirements  many of whom have expressed interest in using the internet in their document automation solutions 
additionally  we intend to develop incremental extensions to the document sciences autograph family of products which can be incorporated by current customers into our existing document automation products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing  introducing and marketing new products on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all  or that new products will achieve market acceptance 
the development organization is composed of self directed teams  in which representatives from various disciplines jointly take responsibility for the development and delivery of each new feature or product 
the development process includes early review of prototypes and demonstrations to incorporate customer feedback and provide an opportunity for management review 
a formal sequence of project phases organizes the development and review process for each team 
we have a formal release planning process for annual maintenance releases  and we deliver interim versions as needed to support our customers 
the development organization maintains a database of all customer and internal requests which forms the basis for release planning 
we expect to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop new products  particularly as they relate to electronic publishing applications 
research and development expenditures have grown substantially since our inception 
such expenditures  not including amounts capitalized  were million  million and million in  and the development organization employed a staff of as of december  we employ independent contractors as needed to supplement the permanent development staff 
competition the market for our document automation products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change  and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
our software products are targeted at document intensive organizations that require the ability to produce large quantities of customized and personalized documents in paper or electronic form 
we face direct and indirect competition from a broad range of competitors who offer a variety of products and solutions to our current and potential customers 
our principal competition currently comes from systems developed in house by the internal mis departments of large organizations where there is a reluctance to commit the time and effort necessary to convert their document automation processes to our document automation software 
we also face competition from docucorp  which is partially owned by xerox  in the insurance industry  m i data services  inc in banking and financial services  group software  inc in commercial direct mailing and other direct general purpose competitors such as ibm s direct composition facility 
several of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers 
it is also possible that we will face competition from new competitors 
these include large independent software companies offering personal computer based application software solutions  such as microsoft corporation and adobe corporation  and from large corporations providing database management software solutions  such as oracle corporation 
in addition  xerox  either directly or through affiliated entities  could be a large competitor 
moreover  as the market for document automation software develops  a number of these or other companies with significantly greater resources than document sciences could attempt to enter or increase their presence in the document automation market by either acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors or by increasing their focus on the industry 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include product performance and functionality  ease of use  scalability  operating across multiple computer and operating system platforms  product and company reputation  client service and support and price 
although we believe we currently compete favorably with respect to such factors  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive position against current and future competitors  especially those with greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us  or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products  new solutions introduced by existing competitors or by new companies entering the market 
patents and proprietary rights our success is dependent  in part  on the ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
we presently have no patents or patent applications pending 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
we are not aware that any of our products infringes upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we also rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurances that such firms will remain in business  that they will continue to support their products or that their products will otherwise continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss or inability to maintain any of these software licenses could result in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
employees as of december   we had employees including in professional services  in sales and marketing  in research and development and in finance and administration 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have experienced no work stoppages and believe our relationship with our employees is good 
competition for qualified personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract  hire and retain qualified personnel 
risk factors the following is a discussion of certain factors which currently impact or may impact our business  operating results and or financial condition 
anyone making an investment decision with respect to our common stock or other securities is cautioned to carefully consider these factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of future operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have a limited operating history 
we were incorporated in october as a wholly owned subsidiary of xerox  and xerox currently owns approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
our limited operating history means that predicting future operating results is difficult  and our operating history during prior periods cannot necessarily be regarded as indicative of our prospects as an independent company 
accordingly  although we have experienced revenue growth in recent years  we cannot assure you that we will sustain such growth in revenues or that we will become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
our quarterly results fluctuate significantly  and we may not be able to maintain our existing growth rates 
our total revenues and operating results can vary  sometimes substantially  from quarter to quarter and we expect them to vary significantly in the future 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast  and our future results will depend upon many factors  including the following the demand for our products  the level of product competition and price competition that we face  the length of our sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the budget cycles of our customers  the level of commissions that we receive from the sale of xerox printers under the strategic marketing alliance that we have with xerox  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the timing of our new product introductions and product enhancements  as well as those of our competitors  our mix of products and services  our level of international sales  the activities of and acquisitions by our competitors  our timing of new hires  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our ability to develop and market new products and to control costs  and general domestic and international economic conditions 
our initial license fee revenue mainly depends on when orders are received and shipped 
however  because of our sales model  our customers implementation schedule and the complexity of the implementation process  revenue from some software shipments may not be recognized in the same quarter as the shipment occurs 
our operating expenses are primarily based on anticipated revenue levels 
since a high percentage of those expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and we may sustain losses as a result 
if such expenses precede increased revenues  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
as a result of these factors  results from operations for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
furthermore  our operating results in some future quarter may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
we are substantially controlled by xerox 
xerox owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
consequently  xerox controls document sciences  is able to elect our entire board of directors and could have significant input into our operations 
in addition  xerox is able to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including potential mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
xerox s voting power could delay or prevent a change in control of document sciences and may prevent or discourage tender offers for our common stock at a premium price by another person or entity 
xerox affiliates currently hold three of the six seats on our board of directors 
our business is dependent on maintaining our relationships with xerox 
we currently have a variety of contractual and informal relationships with xerox and affiliates of xerox  including a cooperative marketing agreement  a transfer and license agreement and various distribution agreements 
we rely on these relationships and agreements for a significant portion of our total revenues 
in  revenues derived from relationships with xerox and affiliates of xerox accounted for approximately million  representing of our total revenues  in  revenues derived from relationships with xerox and affiliates of xerox accounted for approximately million  representing of our total revenues  and in  revenues derived from relationships with xerox and affiliates of xerox accounted for approximately million  representing of our total revenues 
included above were commissions that we received from sales of xerox printers under our strategic marketing alliance with xerox 
these commissions were  and million 
these commissions have little or no associated costs and have contributed a substantial portion of our income from operations for certain prior operating periods 
in addition  these commissions have been inconsistent from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate 
although neither xerox nor its affiliated entities have expressed any intention to terminate their agreements with us  these agreements generally may be terminated on no more than days notice 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that xerox or its affiliates will continue these relationships or  if they do  that they will be on terms favorable to us 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that existing and potential customers will continue to do business with us because of these relationships or our historical ties with xerox and its affiliates 
though we intend to continue our existing relationships with xerox  our strategy is to lessen our dependence on xerox 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so and  because of our current level of dependence on xerox  there can be no assurance that our move to become more independent will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our failure to maintain these relationships  particularly with xerox and its affiliates  or to establish new relationships in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
xerox has strategic alliances and other business relationships with other companies who supply software and services used in high volume electronic publishing applications and who now or in the future may be our competitors 
there can be no assurance that xerox or one of its affiliated companies will not engage in business that directly competes with us 
in addition  xerox has ongoing internal development activities that could in the future lead to products that compete with us 
xerox could in the future expand these relationships or enter into additional ones  and as a result our business could be materially adversely affected 
our growth is dependent upon successfully focusing our distribution channels 
we intend to streamline our worldwide sales and distribution channels by focusing on key target industry market segments where our current and planned products enjoy a significant competitive advantage and a current  high market demand 
we also plan on leveraging our existing relationships with xerox corporation  ibm corporation and their channels and affiliates by launching targeted joint marketing and value added reseller programs and by introducing new product offerings that are optimized for selected target markets and marketing channels 
in addition  we intend to form additional partnerships with system integrators and consultants in order to broaden our capacity to deliver complete document automation solutions that incorporate significant services content  while also maintaining our core domain expertise 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully streamline and focus our worldwide channels  leverage our existing relationships or form new alliances 
if we fail to do so  it will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
continued expansion of our professional services is necessary for our future growth 
we are increasing our focus on the consulting services component of our professional services to assist customers in the planning and implementation of enterprise wide  mission critical document automation applications 
our increased focus is dependent on retaining and hiring professionals to perform these consulting services 
should we be unable to maintain the necessary services workforce  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our growth depends on our introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products 
our future business  operating results and financial condition will depend upon our ability to develop new products that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to emerging industry standards and practices 
our document sciences autograph family of products has been applied mainly to document automation applications producing paper based documents 
we believe that our core technology can be extended to the internet  intranets and commercial on line services  and we have begun initial development activity in this area 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing  introducing and marketing new products or product enhancements  including new products or the extension of existing products for the internet  intranets and commercial on line services  on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
delays in our commercial shipments of new products or enhancements may result in client dissatisfaction and a delay or loss of product revenues 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client requirements  then our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our new products or new versions of our existing products will achieve market acceptance 
in order to provide our customers with integrated product solutions  our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our technology partners  such as jetform corporation and new dimension software 
a longer than expected sales cycle may affect our revenues and operating results 
the licensing of our software products is often an enterprise wide decision by prospective customers and generally involves a sales cycle of three to twelve months in order to educate our prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
in addition  the implementation of our products by customers involves a significant commitment of their resources over an extended period of time  and is commonly associated with substantial customer business process reengineering efforts 
for these and other reasons  our sales and customer implementation cycles are subject to a number of significant delays over which we have little or no control 
any delay in the sale or customer implementation of a limited number of license transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our operating results are substantially dependent on sales of a small number of products in highly concentrated industries 
we derived of our initial license revenues from licenses of compuset and related compuset option products in our initial license fees from dvs and dls comprised and  respectively  in as a result  factors that may adversely impact the pricing of or demand for compuset and related products  such as competition from other products  negative publicity or obsolescence of the hardware or software environments in which our products run  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our financial performance will continue to depend significantly on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our compuset software and related products 
our revenues have been derived from sales to a small number of industries as follows licenses to end users in the insurance and commercial print services industries for accounted for of initial license revenues  licenses to end users in these industries for accounted for of initial license revenues  and licenses to end users in these industries for accounted for of initial license revenues 
our future success will depend on our ability to continue to successfully market our products in these and other industries 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in developing and marketing compuset products and related services 
our failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be exposed to risks associated with international operations 
our revenues from export sales  including sales through our foreign subsidiary  accounted for the following of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in  and of our total revenues in our wholly owned subsidiary  document sciences europe  markets and supports our products in europe 
we license our products in europe through value added resellers and to a lesser extent  direct sales 
our value added resellers are principally xerox affiliates who re market our products 
revenues generated by this subsidiary were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in australia  canada and brazil we distribute our products through fuji xerox co  ltd  xerox canada  ltd 
and xerox brazil  ltd  respectively 
revenues generated by these xerox affiliates were  million and million in  and  respectively 
in order to successfully expand export sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and develop relationships with additional international resellers 
if we are unable to do so in a timely manner  our growth in international export sales could be limited  and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities include currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  our limited experience in localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of our localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing our international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the french franc 
although exchange rate fluctuations have not had a significant impact on us  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar could cause currency transaction gains and losses in future periods 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging transactions  and we cannot assure you that fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future will not have a material adverse impact on our international revenues and our business  operating results or financial condition 
our business is dependent on the emerging market for document automation software 
the market for document automation software is relatively new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented  underdeveloped and subject to rapid change 
marketing and sales techniques in the document automation software marketplace  as well as the bases for competition  are not well established 
we cannot assure you that the market for document automation software will develop or that  if it does develop  organizations will adopt our products 
we have spent  and intend to continue to spend  significant resources educating potential customers about the benefits of our products 
however  we cannot assure you that such expenditures will enable our products to achieve further market acceptance  and if the document automation software market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the commercial market for document automation of electronic documents designed for use with the internet  intranets and commercial on line services has only recently begun to develop  and the success of our products designed for this market will depend in part on their compatibility with such services 
it is difficult to predict whether the internet  intranets and commercial on line services will be a viable commercial marketplace or whether the demand for related products and services will increase or decrease in the future 
since the increased commercial use of the internet  intranets and commercial on line services could require substantial modification and customization of certain of our products and services as well as the introduction of new products and services  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively or successfully compete in this emerging market 
our ability to manage our growth will affect our business 
we have recently experienced a period of growth in total revenues 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future change will require us to continue to improve our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and to expand  train and manage our work force 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so successfully 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business  and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel  none of whom had signed employment agreements with us as of december  the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified product development  sales and management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be able to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified product development  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
our failure to adequately limit our exposure to product liability claims may adversely affect us 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  sale and support of our products may entail the risk of such claims in the future 
a successful product liability claim brought against us or a claim arising as a result of our professional services could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our products may suffer from defects or errors 
software products as complex as those we offer  particularly our new visual compuset and data prep tool products  may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
as a result  we could in the future lose or delay recognition of revenues as a result of software errors or defects 
in addition  our products are typically intended for use in applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
as a result  we expect that our customers and potential customers have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for software products generally 
although our business has not been adversely affected by any such errors to date  we cannot assure you that  despite our testing and testing by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in our new products or releases 
if these errors are discovered after the commencement of commercial shipments  it could result in any of the following loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  diversion of our development resources  damage to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
if any of these factors occur  it would have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may face risks of year noncompliance 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar activities 
based on recent assessments  we have determined that our information technology  or it  and non it systems  software  hardware and equipment  are currently purported by the software and hardware vendors to be able to utilize dates beyond december  however  if such testing disconfirms readiness  the year issue could have a material impact on our operations 
we have queried our significant suppliers and subcontractors that do not share information systems with us 
to date  we are not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  we have no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact us 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
we have not yet completed the final phase of the year program 
in the event that we do not complete the testing phase to confirm readiness and the systems believed to be ready are not  we might be unable to sell merchandise and might be unable to use our financial systems to operate the finance and accounting functions 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect us 
we could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

overview document sciences corporation develops  markets and supports a family of document automation software and services used in high volume electronic publishing applications 
we were incorporated in delaware in october as a wholly owned subsidiary of xerox corporation  and following our initial public offering of stock in september  xerox ownership was reduced to approximately 
on may   we purchased substantially all of the assets of data retrieval corporation of america from the west group 
included in the purchase were exclusive ownership of the textbook  textcomply  textdbms  textgen and textmigrate software products and their installed base of commercial accounts 
we subsequently developed dls and ddm from the technology purchased from data retrieval 
we have retained employees responsible for the development  product support and customer service of the data retrieval software products 
in addition  we will continue to provide training and customer support for existing and future customers for all supported products 
we have initiated an end of life strategy for the products which were replaced by dls and ddm 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues total revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to our revenues are divided into three categories based upon the sources from which they are derived initial license fees  annual renewal license and support fees  and services and other revenues 
initial license fees are comprised principally of license fees for the first year of use of our products by end user customers 
annual renewal license and support fees are comprised principally of mandatory fees paid by customers annually for continued use and support of the licensed products 
services and other revenues are comprised principally of fees for consulting  application development and training services performed by us as well as fees received from xerox in connection with the sale of certain xerox printer products 
we recognize revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
initial license revenue is recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
the portion of the initial license revenue which represents the software support for the first year is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
annual renewal license and support fees are recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenues from commissions paid by xerox in connection with the sale of xerox printer products are recognized upon installation of the printer products 
revenues generated from consulting services are recognized as the related services are performed 
however  when such consulting services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software product  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts 
we sell our products principally through our direct sales force domestically  and internationally principally through distributors and value added resellers vars and  to a lesser extent  through our direct sales force 
revenues from export sales and sales through our foreign subsidiary were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to revenue from export sales were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in total export revenue is due primarily to our increased presence in foreign markets 
we maintain a strategic marketing alliance with xerox under which both parties agree to pay each other fees on referrals that lead to the successful sale or licensing of each other s products 
our revenues from this strategic marketing alliance were million   and  in  and  respectively 
these commissions were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
commissions paid relating to referrals from xerox were   and in  and  respectively 
we have entered into distributorship agreements with various xerox foreign affiliates to remarket our products internationally 
our revenues from such distributorship agreements relating to the licensing  maintenance and support of our products were million in and and million in initial license fees 
initial license fee revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to the decrease from to reflects the greater dependence on solution sales and the adoption of sop  software revenue recognition  which was effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  this sop requires deferring recognition of some revenues  depending on the nature and complexity of certain transactions 
the application of sop contributed million to the increase in deferred revenue in initial license revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
annual renewal license and support fees 
revenues from annual renewal licenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the increase in both periods was principally due to an increase in the installed base of users of our software products  including the increase in our installed base of customers resulting from the data retrieval purchase 
as a percentage of total revenues  annual renewal license and support fees were  and in  and  respectively 
services and other 
revenues from services and other were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the increase in each period was principally due to the increased number of new customer licenses of our software generating increased demand for services as well as the increasing scope of professional services offered 
revenues from services and other were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of initial license fees 
cost of initial license revenues were   and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of initial license revenues in  and  respectively 
cost of initial licenses of software includes documentation  reproduction costs  product packaging  packaging design  product media  employment costs for training  installation and distribution personnel  the cost of third party software and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs 
the increase in the cost of initial licenses was primarily the result of increased payments for third party software integrated into our visual compuset products and an increase in the amount of capitalized software resulting from the rd quarter release of visual compuset and dpt 
cost of annual renewal licenses 
cost of annual renewal licenses consists principally of the employment related costs for our technical support staff  which performs technical software support services 
cost of annual licenses renewals revenues was   and  in  and  respectively  representing  and of annual renewal license revenues 
while the relative cost of servicing the customer base is decreasing  the increase in absolute dollars is attributable to additional technical support personnel necessary to support the customer base acquired from data retrieval and an increase in the installed base of users of our software products 
cost of services and other 
cost of services and other revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of services and other revenue 
cost of services and other consists principally of the employment related costs of our consulting and training staff 
the increase in cost of services and other revenues in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of revenue resulted principally from the addition of new staff to perform our professional services 
as the new professional services staff becomes more experienced in our products and solutions  the cost of services and other revenues as a percentage of revenues is expected to decrease 
there are little or no costs related to commissions from the sale of xerox printers under the strategic marketing alliance 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to research and development expenses consist primarily of the employment related costs of personnel associated with developing new products  enhancing existing products  testing software products and developing product documentation 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to direct significant resources to development and enhancement of products 
we expense all costs for research and development of new products until technological feasibility has been assured 
thereafter  costs of software development are capitalized until general release of the product 
the capitalized costs of software development are amortized using the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current product revenues to estimated total product revenues or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic lives of the products 
we capitalized software development costs of   and  in  and  respectively 
we expect that capitalization of software development costs will decrease in the future if the time between the establishment of technological feasibility of a product and its general release decreases as expected 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing programs and related costs for pre and post sales activity 
the increase for both periods was the result of adding personnel to increase geographic coverage of the selling organization and the related costs and commissions associated with revenues 
selling and marketing expenses were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of employment related costs for finance  administration and human resources and general corporate management expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in was the result of increased provisions for bad debts  a one time charge for severance and recruiting costs  increased costs of outside consultants and professional fees as well as planned growth in the finance and administrative operations 
restructuring charges 
in connection with a restructuring plan adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million restructuring charge associated with our actions to reduce our overall cost structure to reflect a staff size that had become inconsistent with our revenue base 
this charge included the termination of employees  the write off of impaired assets and a reduction in our leased facilities 
interest  net 
interest  net is composed of interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments offset by finance charges related to equipment leases 
interest  net was  million and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily due to declining cash balances as a result of operational losses in provision for income taxes 
effective tax rates were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
the rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due a valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets 
from our inception to september   our operating results were included in the consolidated tax returns of xerox corporation 
subsequent to our initial public offering on september   we were no longer included in the consolidated tax returns of xerox corporation 
factors that may affect future operating results our total revenues and operating results can vary  sometimes substantially  from quarter to quarter and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
future results will depend upon many factors  including the demand for our products  the level of product and price competition  the length of our sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the budget cycles of our customers  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by us and our competitors  the mix of products and services sold  levels of international sales  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  the timing of new hires  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our ability to develop and market new products  controlling costs and general domestic and international economic conditions 
in addition  our sales generally reflect a relatively high amount of revenue per order  and  therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on our revenues and quarterly operating results 
in addition  a significant amount of our revenues occur predominantly in the third month of each fiscal quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month 
our software products generally are shipped as orders are received 
as a result  initial license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the timing of receipt of initial license revenue is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle  typically three to twelve months from the initial contact 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue trends and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of initial license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
due to the foregoing factors  revenues and operating results for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in net cash used in operating activities was  and  in and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  primarily for the purchase of short term investments and to a lesser extent  for the purchase of fixed assets 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  due primarily to net short term investment sales and maturities partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and additions to computer software costs 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million  primarily from net proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock 
net cash used in financing activities was  and  in and  respectively  primarily from the purchase of treasury stock 
we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through the next twelve months 
a portion of our cash could be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
we are currently evaluating  in our ordinary course of business  potential investments such as businesses  products or technologies 
we have no current understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies 
recently enacted accounting standards in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas requires that all components of comprehensive income  including net income  be reported in the financial statements in the period they are recognized 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
net income and other comprehensive income  including foreign currency translation adjustments  and unrealized gains and losses on investments  shall be reported  net of their related tax effect  to arrive at comprehensive income 
we have disclosed comprehensive income in our financial statements accordingly 
sfas no 
amends the requirements for public enterprises to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments 
operating segments  as defined in sfas no 
 are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by a company in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the financial information is required to be reported on the basis that is used internally for evaluating the segment performance 
we believe we operate in two segments  which have been identified by management as united states and france operations 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar activities 
based on recent assessments  we have determined that our information technology  or it  and non it systems  software  hardware and equipment  are currently purported by the software and hardware vendors to be able to utilize dates beyond december  however  if such testing disconfirms readiness  the year issue could have a material impact on our operations 
our plan to resolve the year issue involves the following three phases assessment  remediation and testing 
to date  we have fully completed our assessment of all systems that could be significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that most of our significant it and non it systems are ready for the year the few components of our end user computing infrastructure that remain to be upgraded will be addressed during the second quarter accordingly  we do not believe that the year presents a material exposure as it relates to our operations 
in addition  we have gathered information about the year compliance status of our significant suppliers and subcontractors and we continue to monitor their compliance 
for our information technology exposures  we are complete on the remediation phase and expect to complete software reprogramming and replacement no later than june  once our software is upgraded or replaced  we will begin testing to confirm year readiness 
to date  we have completed of our testing and readiness confirmation 
completion of the testing phase for all significant systems is expected by september   with readiness at that time 
we do not have any significant electronic transactions with suppliers or customers 
our electronic transactions with financial institutions have been assessed and have been confirmed ready through testing 
we have queried our significant suppliers and subcontractors that do not share information systems with us 
to date  we are not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  we have no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact us 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
we will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  of which  has been incurred and we expect to incur  in  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
we believe we have an effective program in place to test and confirm year readiness in a timely manner 
as noted above  we have not yet completed the final phase of the year program 
in the event that we do not complete the testing phase to confirm readiness and the systems believed to be ready are not  we might be unable to sell merchandise and might be unable to use our financial systems to operate the finance and accounting functions 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect us 
we could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we have developed contingency plans to address failure of remediation activities as applied to internal  it and non it  systems and external agents 
we have identified specific contingency plan options related to our supply chain management process 
in assessing our critical suppliers  management has prioritized these business relationships and is developing plans to provide for the continuance of product availability through accelerated purchasing should adequate assurance regarding a specific entity s ability to become ready for the year not be obtained 
euro conversion beginning in january  a new currency called the euro is scheduled to be introduced in certain economic and monetary union  or emu  countries 
during  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro currency will have on the marketplace 
additionally  all of the final rules and regulations have not yet been defined and finalized by the european commission with regard to the euro currency 
we are still assessing the impact the emu formation will have on our internal systems and the sale of our products 
we expect to take appropriate actions based on the results of such assessment 
we have not yet determined any potential cost 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies on non us based competitors 
the primary foreign currency risk exposure is related to us dollar to french franc and us dollar to euro conversions 
considering both the anticipated cash flows from firm sales commitments and anticipated sales for the next quarter and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year end  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not materially adversely affect expected first quarter earnings or cash flows 
this analysis is dependent on actual export sales during the next quarter occurring within of budgeted forecasts 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the affect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects described above 
in addition  it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
each month we review our position for expected currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments and  secondly  from our capital lease arrangements 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the net fair value of the investment portfolio by approximately  as of december
