cash and cash equivalents which excludes cash and investments restricted of million  letter of credit deposits of million  investment certificates of million  and lease security deposits of million decreased by million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the funding of lease security deposits in connection with the leasing of five facilities in  earnest money deposits for the river bay club facility leased in january   development costs related to development activities  improvements at owned and leased facilities and general corporate purposes 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an additional five facilities leased in  a full year s operating results for the six facilities purchased and leased during and improved operating results for the five facilities operated for the full year and net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  due to increased development activity for third parties which was partially offset by the decrease in cash paid for lease security deposits and acquisitions 
in  the company leased five facilities  and in  the company leased four facilities  purchased the hawthorn lakes and edina park plaza facilities and acquired a third party s interest in the heritage and the devonshire facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the follow on offerings of million offset by increased borrowings under the line of credit of million and decreased fundings in letter of credit deposits of million related to tax exempt bonds 
in january  the company increased its unsecured line of credit to million of which approximately million was drawn at december  the line of credit bears interest at prime plus per annum at december

the company currently plans to acquire or lease to senior independent and assisted living facilities per year containing an aggregate of approximately to  units  and to commence development of to new facilities per year containing approximately units 
the company anticipates that new developments will require to months for pre construction development  to months for construction and approximately months after opening to achieve a stabilized occupancy rate of approximately 
the total construction costs  including construction period financing costs and operating deficits during the lease up period  for the unit prototype are estimated to be approximately million  or approximately  per unit 
at march   the company had sites under development for third parties for new senior independent and assisted living facilities  of which were under construction 
the company s estimated capital expenditures related to sites under development aggregate to approximately million to million 
capital expenditures related to the company s existing facilities  including the unit expansion at the hawthorn lakes facility currently under construction  are estimated to be approximately million to million in the company is currently negotiating to increase and extend its line of credit 
the company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which the company may issue up to million of equity or debt securities 
in november  the company issued million of common stock and may consider additional financing through the issuance of debt and or equity 
in order to achieve its growth plans  the company will be required to obtain a substantial amount of additional financing 
the company anticipates that it may use a combination of additional equity financing and debt financing  lease transactions and cash generated from operations to fund its acquisition and development activities 
the company presently has no commitment  arrangement or understanding regarding financing to fund the debt portion of the company s acquisition and development plans other than the million commitment from capital corporation of america  of which million has been committed to the austin  texas and southfield  michigan development projects which are being developed for third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the financing necessary for its acquisition and development programs 
the company is dependent on third party financing for its acquisition and development programs 
some financing obtained in the future is expected to contain terms and conditions and representations and warranties that are customary for such loans and may contain financing covenants and other restrictions that i require the company to meet certain financial tests and maintain certain amounts of funds in escrow  ii limit  among other things  the ability of the company to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets and engage in mergers or other business combinations and iii restrict the ability of the company to operate competing facilities within certain distances from mortgaged facilities 
there can be no assurance that financing for the company s acquisition and development program will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all 
a lack of funds may require the company to delay or eliminate all or some of its development projects and acquisition plans and could therefore have a material adverse effect on the company s growth plans and its business plan  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  the company s ability to increase cash flow to meet rising costs has not been adversely affected in any material way by existing  or proposed  rent control ordinances 
rent control ordinances may not be applicable to the company s facilities due to the services provided for the monthly fees charged to its residents 
if the company s facilities were subject to rent control ordinances  an imposed limitation on the resident fees that the company may charge at such facility could impair the company s ability to meet any rising costs of operating the facility 
impact of inflation resident fees from senior independent and assisted living facilities owned or leased by the company and management fees from facilities managed by the company for third parties are its primary sources of revenue 
these revenues are affected by monthly resident fee rates and facility occupancy rates 
the rates charged for senior independent and assisted living services are highly dependent upon local market conditions and the competitive environment in which the facilities operate 
substantially all of the company s resident agreements allow for adjustments in the monthly fees payable thereunder not less frequently than every months  thereby enabling the company to seek increases in monthly fees due to inflation or other factors 
any such increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy at the company s facilities 
the company believes  however  that the ability of the company to periodically adjust the monthly fee generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation 
in addition  employee compensation expense is a principal cost element of facility operations and is also dependent upon local market conditions 
there can be no assurance that resident fees will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes 
in addition  as of december   approximately million in principal amount of the company s indebtedness bore interest at tax exempt floating rates and future indebtedness may bear floating rate interest 
inflation  and its impact on floating interest rates  could affect the amount of interest payments due on such indebtedness 
readiness for year the company has implemented a program to assess  remediate and mitigate the potential impact of the year issue throughout the company 
the company s program has been structured to address its internal computer systems and applications  network services operations  facilities operations and third party vendors and suppliers 
the company believes that it is taking the necessary steps within its control to mitigate the potential impact of the year issue on the company 
information systems the company is in the process of upgrading its accounting  human resources  property management and marketing systems prior to the assessment of its year issue 
the company expects that the replacement of its current system will mitigate the impact of the year issue on its accounting operations 
the corporate software selection has been completed  a contract was executed in the third quarter of and development and implementation were commenced in the fourth quarter of the company has one vendor software package that is used to process property level accounting information at each facility which is not year compliant 
the vendor is developing a conversion to ensure that the software package is year compliant 
the company is in the process of selecting replacement software at the facilities it owns or operates and is expected to do so in the second quarter of in the event it is determined that the vendor of the current software is unable to ensure the software package is year compliant 
the company anticipates completing the corporate project no later than the second quarter of and the facilities project no later than the fourth quarter of facilities the company has commenced an assessment of each facility  including an assessment of infrastructure equipment such as elevator  hvac and security systems  and other critical service provider readiness issues 
the company completed its preliminary assessment by december  the vendor software package at each facility is used for resident billing and payable processing 
as noted above  the company is in the process of selecting replacement software in the event the vendor of the current software is unable to ensure that the existing software is year compliant 
during the first half of  the company will undertake contingency planning for each of its facilities as necessary 
third party vendors and suppliers the company s approach to third party suppliers involves the process of identification and prioritization of critical suppliers and communicating with them about their plans and progress in addressing the year issue 
this evaluation  including prioritization of critical suppliers  and the subsequent contingency planning will be undertaken during the first half of calendar costs the final cost to complete the project has not yet been determined  however  the estimated total cost  including capital expenditures  will approximate million to million through december  the company s costs include outside consultants and contractors and hardware and software replacements and upgrades 
the company anticipates that cash on hand  cash generated from operations and additional debt and equity financings will provide sufficient cash to fund year compliance expenditures 
the company s allocation of other personnel resources and planned expenditures has not resulted in the deferral of any information technology projects 
remediation costs  other than the planned expenditures described above  are not expected to be material 
risks the company may face potential year related risks and may experience business interruption to its operations as a result of third party vendors and suppliers failing to address their year compliance issues 
the company s plan includes an assessment of third party vendors and suppliers to identify year compliance issues and the potential impact upon the company and its operations 
project completion dates are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the ability of third parties to modify the company s systems on a timely basis 
there can be no guarantee that the project will be completed in a timely manner 
specific factors that might delay completion of the project include  but are not limited to  the availability of qualified personnel  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
although the company intends to continue preparations for year  it is not possible to quantify potential indirect effects resulting from the lack of readiness of any third party with whom the company conducts its business 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year disclosure should be read in conjunction with cautionary statements on page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing and leasing activities 
there is inherent risk from borrowings and leasing as they mature and are renewed at current market rates
