notebook computers continue to represent the largest portion of the company s sales at  with dollar volume increasing more than from the average selling price of desktop cpu s decreased and the average selling price of notebook cpu s declined from the company believes there may be additional decreases in prices for personal computers and related products 
such decreases require the company to sell more units in order to maintain or increase the level of sales 
should future manufacturer price reductions or the company s marketing efforts fail to increase the level of unit sales  the company s sales growth rate and operating results could be adversely affected 
sales of compaq  hewlett packard  ibm  microsoft and toshiba products comprise a substantial portion of the company s sales 
the loss of any of these  or any other key vendors  could have an adverse effect on the company s results from operations

the fastest growing product categories in terms of sales dollars in were desktop computers at  network and communication products at  software at  data storage devices at  and printers at 
demand for certain products offered by the company  and the growth of certain product categories  are driven by advances in technology and the development of new products and applications by the industry manufacturers  and acceptance of these new technologies and products by end users

gross profit decreased as a percentage of net sales to for the twelve months ended december   compared to in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily the result of lower selling margins achieved on certain product lines  lower levels of inventory price protection from vendors and increased shipping costs 
the lower levels of price protection in were the result of changes by certain manufacturers in the terms and conditions of their inventory price protection programs 
on a forward looking basis  it is likely that the gross profit margin achieved will be less than  and could be less than the achieved in the statement concerning future gross profit is a forward looking statement that involves certain risks and uncertainties such as the continued participation by vendors in inventory price protection and rebate programs  product mix  market conditions and other factors which could result in a fluctuation of gross margins below recent experience 
certain manufacturers may make additional changes that limit the amount of price protection for which the company is eligible 
such changes could have a negative impact on gross margin in future periods 
vendor rebate programs are at the discretion of the vendor and many of these programs are dependent on achieving certain goals and objectives 
accordingly  there is no certainty that such programs will continue at their current levels or that the established goals and objectives will be attained

the cooperative advertising reimbursement rate may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the level of vendor participation achieved and collection experience

the company has initiated a yk project and assigned a yk project team designed to make all its hardware and software systems yk compliant prior to december  the company intends to contract an outside organization to review its project methodology and status to ensure all aspects of the yk issue have been addressed 
project cdw s yk project consists of internal and external components 
the internal section has been divided into five steps awareness awareness includes evaluating industry best practices  generating management and employee awareness  establishing communications methods and establishing the project team 
assessment this phase includes hardware and software compliance assessment  establishment of the size and scope of the project  establishment of a project timeline  priorities  budgeting and allocation of resources

the awareness  assessment and renovation phases of the project were completed prior to december as a result of the assessment phase  the company believes it will not be required to replace any of its hardware components or significant portions of its software to make its systems yk compliant 
as of december  the company believes it has completed substantially all of the validation and implementation of internal systems critical to continuing operations 
the remaining portions of the internal project include validation and implementation of secondary files and systems  as well as the review of project methodology and status to be conducted by an outside organization 
the external portion of the project focuses on assessing the yk readiness of product and service vendors and its potential impact on the company s operations 
the company will begin communications with its vendors in the first quarter of to assess the status of the vendors yk projects

risks the failure to correct a material yk problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations

due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the yk readiness of third party suppliers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of yk failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s yk project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the yk problem and  in particular  about the yk compliance and readiness of its material vendors 
the company believes that  with the completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be minimized 
although the company believes the potential impact is not material  as a result of the yk issue the company may be exposed to lawsuits resulting from the sale of products which are not yk compliant 
the statements concerning future impact of the yk issue are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties  such as the inability to receive products on a timely basis from vendors  ship products to customers and other factors  which could have a material impact on the company s results from operations 
certain vendors may fail to adequately prepare their information systems or the company s own yk project may not correct all yk issues 
accordingly  there is no certainty that either the company or its vendors will complete their yk projects prior to december  certain statements included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concerning the company s sales growth  gross profit as a percentage of sales  advertising expense  cooperative advertising reimbursements  exit charge and yk readiness are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties  as specified herein
