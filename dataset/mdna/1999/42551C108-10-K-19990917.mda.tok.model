basis of presentation as more fully described in item business and properties overview of the reorganization  bclp ii completed a reorganization on june  pursuant to which bclp was formed as a holding entity for bclp ii 
from its date of formation until the completion of the reorganization  bclp had no material assets and was not engaged in any business operations 
prior to the reorganization  bclp ii  through its subsidiaries  owned and operated the boston celtics 
accordingly  the operating results of the boston celtics are consolidated in bclp ii s financial statements for periods prior to the reorganization 
upon completion of the reorganization  effective june   bclp s and bclp ii s interest in the accounts and operations of the boston celtics is reflected in their indirect investment in celtics basketball holdings  which is accounted for on the equity method 
celtics basketball holdings has a limited partnership interest in celtics basketball  which owns and operates the boston celtics effective july  because bclp had not engaged in any business operations prior to june   the selected consolidated statement of operations data presented in item above and the following discussion compare the operating results of bclp and its subsidiaries for the year ended june  with those of bclp ii and its subsidiaries for the year ended june   and compare the operating results of bclp ii and its subsidiaries for the year ended june  with the year ended june  due to the july  change in bclp s and bclp ii s method of accounting for their investment in the accounts and operations of the boston celtics from consolidation to the equity method  bclp s and bclp ii s results of operations in the fiscal year ended june  are materially different than those in the fiscal year ended june  reorganization costs amounted to approximately  which consisted primarily of legal and professional expenses  costs of printing and distribution and filing fees 
these costs were charged to operations by bclp ii prior to june  collective bargaining agreement nba players  including those that play for the boston celtics  were previously covered by a collective bargaining agreement between the nba and the nbpa that was to be in effect through june  under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement  the nba had the right to terminate the collective bargaining agreement after the season if it was determined that the aggregate salaries and benefits paid by all nba teams for the season exceeded of projected basketball related income  as defined in the collective bargaining agreement bri 
in march the board of governors of the nba voted to reopen the collective bargaining agreement  as it had been determined that the aggregate salaries and benefits paid by the nba teams for the season would exceed of projected bri 
effective july   the nba commenced a lockout of nba players in support of its attempt to reach a new collective bargaining agreement 
on january   the nba and the nbpa entered into a new collective bargaining agreement  thereby ending the lockout 
the new collective bargaining agreement is to be in effect through june   and the nba has an option to extend it for one year thereafter 
as a result of the lockout  the nba regular season consisted of games per team of which were home games  beginning in early february ordinarily  the nba regular season consists of games per team of which are home games  and generally begins in late october or early november 
further  as provided under the terms of the new collective bargaining agreement  nba teams were only required to pay of each player s salary with respect to the regular season 
previously  an independent arbitrator ruled that nba teams  including the boston celtics  were not required to pay player salaries during the lockout 
nba teams  including the boston celtics  refunded amounts paid by season ticket holders plus interest at for a total of home games including two exhibition games that were canceled as a result of the lockout 
refunds of approximately  including interest of  were paid by celtics basketball on a monthly basis for games canceled in the preceding month 
in addition  certain season ticket holders elected to leave their refunds and interest on deposit for future games 
such refunds and interest amounted to approximately  at june  including interest of approximately 
no interest has accrued on such amounts since january  general the boston celtics derive revenues principally from the sale of tickets to home games and the licensing of television  cable network and radio rights 
the most significant expenses of the boston celtics are player and coaching salaries 
a large portion of the boston celtics annual revenues and operating expense is determinable at the commencement of each basketball season based on season ticket sales and the boston celtics multi year contracts with its players  coaches and broadcast organizations 
the operations and financial results of the boston celtics are seasonal 
on a cash flow basis  the boston celtics receive a substantial portion of their receipts from the advance sale of season tickets during the months of june through october  prior to the commencement of the nba regular season 
cash receipts from playoff ticket sales are received in march of any year for which the team qualifies for league playoffs 
most of the boston celtics operating expenses are incurred and paid during the regular season  which extends from late october or early november through late april 
for financial reporting purposes the boston celtics recognize revenues and expenses on a game by game basis 
because the nba regular season begins in late october or early november  the first fiscal quarter  which ends on september  will generally include limited or no revenue and will reflect a net loss attributable to general and administrative expenses incurred in the quarter 
based on the present nba game schedule  the boston celtics generally recognizes approximately one third of its annual regular season revenue in the second fiscal quarter  approximately one half of such revenue in the third fiscal quarter and the remainder in the fourth fiscal quarter  and it recognizes its playoff revenue  if any  in the fourth fiscal quarter 
due to the lockout in the season  however  the operating results of the boston celtics for the year ended june  did not reflect historical seasonal trends 
the consolidated statements of operations data include the results of operations of television station wfxt prior to its sale on july   as well as the gain on its disposal  as discontinued operations 
results of operations consolidated loss before extraordinary charge for the year ended june  was  or per unit and consolidated net loss for the year ended june  was  or per unit compared with bclp ii s consolidated net income for the year ended june  of  or per unit 
the significant loss before extraordinary charge in fiscal is primarily a result of the lockout  the cancellation of regular season games and the reduced number of games in the revised nba schedule 
in addition  interest expense on the subordinated debentures issued on june  in connection with the reorganization  including amortization of the original issue discount  amounted to  in fiscal bclp ii recorded an extraordinary charge in the three months ended september  related to the early retirement of notes payable to a former principal unitholder relating to redeemed bclp ii units 
the notes payable to the former principal unitholder had an aggregate initial face amount of  the notes  which were due and payable on july   also provided that the amounts to be paid to such unitholder were to be increased by specified amounts on each july during their term 
if the principal unitholder held the notes until july   he would have been entitled to receive aggregate payments excluding interest in the amount of  each of the notes bore interest payable quarterly at the rate of per annum 
at september   bclp ii repaid the notes payable  which had an aggregate balance  including scheduled increases in the note balances  of  the notes payable were repaid in the amount of  resulting in an extraordinary charge of  related to early retirement of notes payable 
income from continuing operations for the year ended june  included charges totaling  in the three months ended june  related to significant personnel changes  primarily in basketball operations 
these non recurring charges consisted primarily of player contract termination costs  bonuses and relocation costs  severance costs  and salaries for the new coaching staff 
no such non recurring charges were recorded in the year ended june   which  among other things  contributed to an increase in net income for the year ended june  equity in loss of celtics basketball holdings  lp of  for the year ended june  represents bclp s interest in the income loss of the entity that indirectly owns and operates the boston celtics basketball team subsequent to the reorganization 
prior to the reorganization  the operating results of the boston celtics basketball team were consolidated with bclp ii s operating results 
celtics basketball recognizes boston celtics team and game revenues and expenses on a game by game basis  and the nba regular season ordinarily begins in late october or early november 
as a result  bclp ii s operating results for the year ended june  included revenues from ticket sales  television and radio broadcast rights fees and promotional advertising  and included team and game expenses 
had bclp ii accounted for a interest of the boston celtics basketball team for the year ended june  using the equity method  bclp ii s pro forma equity in income of the boston celtics would have amounted to  reflecting  among other things  team and game revenues and expenses related to the regular season games played by the boston celtics in the year ended june  due to the cancellation of regular season games in the season  the boston celtics did not commence their season until early february  and the boston celtics played regular season games in the year ended june  as a result  the results of operations of celtics basketball for the year ended june  reflected a net loss  as net team and game income related to the regular season games played were more than offset by general and administrative expenses  selling and promotional expenses  certain team expenses contractually related to the canceled games and interest expense  net of interest income 
revenues from regular season ticket sales of  in fiscal  which related entirely to the boston celtics basketball team  increased by  compared to  in fiscal the increase was a result of increased ticket sales  believed to be primarily caused by improved performance of the basketball team as well as an increase in ticket prices

other revenues  principally promotional advertising revenues of  in fiscal  which related entirely to the boston celtics basketball team  increased  as compared to  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to increases in revenues from promotional activities  as well as proceeds received from nba properties from the licensing of novelty type products 
team expenses of  in fiscal  which related entirely to the boston celtics basketball team  decreased by  compared to  in fiscal player and coaching salaries increased approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to changes in team player and coaching personnel  but this increase was offset by the effect of certain charges of approximately  recorded in the three months ended june  that did not recur in fiscal these non recurring charges recorded in the three months ended june  related to personnel changes in basketball operations  including player contract termination costs  bonuses and relocation costs  severance costs  and salaries for the new coaching staff

bclp s general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal decreased by  compared to bclp ii s general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal included general and administrative expenses related to the boston celtics basketball team of  effective july   bclp accounts for its indirect interest in the boston celtics basketball team using the equity method  and  accordingly  general and administrative expenses related to the boston celtics basketball team in fiscal are included in equity in loss of celtics basketball holdings 
the balance of the decreases in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is a result of decreased personnel and other general and administrative expenses as a result of the reorganization 
general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal decreased  compared to  in fiscal  primarily as a result of reduced expense related to options to acquire units of partnership interest  partially offset by increased professional  consulting and legal expenses primarily related to the reorganization  and increased management fees 
selling and promotional expenses of  in fiscal  which related entirely to the boston celtics basketball team  increased  compared to  in fiscal the increase in fiscal is a result of increased personnel costs 
depreciation expense of  in fiscal decreased by  compared to bclp ii s depreciation expense of  in fiscal depreciation expense in fiscal included  of depreciation expense related to the boston celtics basketball team 
depreciation expense of  in fiscal increased  compared to  in fiscal the increase in is primarily attributable to additional depreciation related to additions to property and equipment and leasehold improvements in leased office space 
amortization expense of  in fiscal decreased by  compared to bclp ii s amortization expense of  in fiscal bclp s amortization expense increased  in fiscal due to an increase in deferred financing costs  but this increase was offset by the fact that amortization expense in fiscal included  of amortization related to the boston celtics basketball team 
amortization expense of  in fiscal was consistent with amortization expense in fiscal interest expense of  in fiscal increased  compared to  in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to interest of  related to the subordinated debentures issued by bclp ii in connection with the reorganization including amortization of the original issue discount on the subordinated debentures and interest of  related to new borrowings under bclp ii s revolving credit agreement with its commercial bank 
these increases were partially offset by the fact that interest expense in fiscal included interest expense related to the boston celtics basketball team of  effective july   bclp accounts for its indirect interest in the boston celtics basketball team using the equity method  and  accordingly  interest expense related to the boston celtics basketball team for the year ended june  is included in equity in loss of celtics basketball holdings 
interest expense of  in fiscal increased  compared to  in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily a result of the new  borrowing by bclp ii in may interest income from marketable securities and other short term investments of  in fiscal decreased  compared to  in fiscal  and interest income in fiscal decreased  compared to  in fiscal the decreases are attributable to a reduced amount of available funds for short term investment as well as the effect of a decrease in interest rates on those invested balances in bclp s provision for income taxes of  in fiscal  which relates to bclp s subsidiary corporations  decreased  compared to  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources bclp used approximately  in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal bclp ii generated approximately  and  in cash from operating activities in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal is directly attributable to bclp s accounting for its interest in the boston celtics on the equity method effective july  in addition  cash used in operating activities in fiscal included the first annual interest payment due on the subordinated debentures in the amount of  capital expenditures amounted to approximately  and  in and  respectively 
at june  the partnership had approximately  of cash and cash equivalents and  of other short term investments 
in addition to these amounts  sources of funds available to the partnership include funds generated by operations  unused portions of credit facilities with its commercial bank  and distributions from celtics basketball holdings  which through a subsidiary owns and operates the boston celtics 
these resources will be used to repay commercial bank borrowings and for general partnership purposes  working capital needs or possible investments and or acquisitions 
on may   bclp ii entered into a  revolving credit agreement with its commercial bank   of which was reserved for the repayment of notes payable related to redeemed bclp ii units 
interest on advances under the revolving credit agreement accrues at bclp ii s option of either libor plus or the greater of the bank s base rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 
the revolving credit agreement expires on june  and is secured by a pledge of certain short term investments of ccc  an indirect subsidiary of bclp and bclp ii 
on may    was advanced under the revolving credit agreement in connection with the reorganization  and on september   bclp ii borrowed the  reserved for the repayment of notes payable related to redeemed bclp ii units and repaid the notes with the proceeds 
on june   bclp ii borrowed  against the revolving credit agreement for general working capital purposes 
management anticipates that amounts advanced under the revolving credit agreement will be repaid by bclp ii out of cash flows  principally distributions from celtics basketball holdings 
in connection with the reorganization  bclp ii distributed subordinated debentures to certain former holders of bclp ii units 
one face value subordinated debenture was distributed for each of the  bclp ii units with respect to which a bclp ii unitholder elected to receive subordinated debentures  cash and bclp units 
the subordinated debentures were recorded at per debenture  the fair market value at date of issue  or  the original issue discount of  is being amortized over the year life of the debentures using the interest method and accordingly  the subordinated debentures are carried on the balance sheet at  at june  the subordinated debentures bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable annually commencing june   and mature on june  there is no mandatory redemption of the subordinated debentures  and they are not entitled to any sinking fund 
no cash distributions to unitholders of bclp were declared or paid during the year ended june  during the year ended june   a cash distribution of per bclp ii unit was paid to bclp ii unitholders on january  declared december  to unitholders of record on december  
in addition  a cash distribution of per unit was paid to bclp ii unitholders electing to receive subordinated debentures and bclp units in connection with the reorganization 
future distributions will be determined by bclp gp in its sole discretion based  among other things  on available resources and the needs of the partnership  the ability of bclp s subsidiaries to generate sufficient operating cash flow  and the funds available after debt service payments related to the notes payable to commercial bank  notes payable relating to redeemed partnership units and the subordinated debentures 
management believes that bclp s cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments together with cash from operating activities will provide adequate cash for the partnership and its subsidiaries to meet their cash requirements through june  market risk at june   bclp had invested approximately  in loan participations issued by a commercial bank with maturities of less than ninety days 
due to their short maturities and applicable transfer restrictions  management believes that the loan participations are not exposed to market risk 
management further believes that the partnership has no other assets that are subject to market risk 
year the inability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a two digit year is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
as the year approaches  such systems may be unable to accurately process certain date based information 
as used by the partnership  year ready means that a system will function in the year without modification or adjustment  or with a one time manual adjustment 
state of readiness the partnership has established a year committee and an action plan for addressing year issues 
the partnership s action plan for addressing year issues in its information technology it and non it systems covers four phases i identification of all it and non it systems  ii assessment of year issues  iii repair of it and non it systems  if necessary  and testing and integration of repaired systems  and iv creation of a contingency plan to address any potential year failures 
the partnership is also contacting third parties with which it deals such as customers and suppliers to evaluate their year readiness and determine whether any year failure will affect their ability to perform as the year approaches and arrives 
as of june   the partnership has completed the first three phases of its year action plan with respect to its it systems 
the partnership has identified all of its it systems which are comprised solely of an internal personal computer network and commercially available software products  assessed the year readiness of these systems which involved review and testing by the partnership s internal information technology specialists and made necessary repairs 
as of june   the partnership has completed the first phase of its year action plan  and has begun the second phase  with respect to its non it systems 
the partnership has identified all of its non it systems which are comprised of embedded systems contained in its leased properties and has assessed the year readiness of approximately of these systems through review and testing 
the partnership is scheduled to complete all four phases of its year initiative with respect to both it and non it systems no later than september  the partnership has received assurances from a majority of its suppliers and third parties with which it interacts that they have addressed their year issues 
the partnership is evaluating these assurances for their adequacy and accuracy and  in cases where the partnership has not received assurances from third parties  is initiating further mail or phone correspondence 
as a general matter  the partnership is vulnerable to failures by third parties to address their own year issues 
the partnership relies heavily upon third parties for ticketing  producing and broadcasting basketball games and for transporting the boston celtics players  coaches and equipment to and from basketball games 
there can be no assurance that the partnership s suppliers and third parties will adequately address their year issues  and any such issues could have a material adverse effect upon the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
costs to address the year issue the partnership has not spent a material amount to remediate year problems and does not anticipate that it will spend a material amount to remediate year problems in the future 
risks presented by the year issue until it has fully completed the first two phases of its year action plan with respect to both it and non it systems  the partnership cannot accurately estimate the risks of its year issue 
to date  the partnership has not identified any it system or non it system that presents a material risk of not being ready for the year the partnership s year action plan may  however  identify systems that present a risk of year related disruption 
any such disruption could have a material adverse effect upon the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the failure to address year issues by the partnership s suppliers and other third parties with which it interacts could have a material adverse effect upon the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
contingency plans the partnership s year action plan calls for the partnership to develop a year contingency plan 
because the partnership has not fully assessed its possible risks from year failures  it has not yet developed a year contingency plan 
the partnership will develop such a plan if the results of its year action plan identify risks of a year failure
