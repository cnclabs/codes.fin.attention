year readiness disclosure the following disclosure may be deemed year readiness disclosure pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act 
state of readiness during  the company commenced a program to review the year compliance status of both the it and non it software and systems used in its internal business processes  to obtain appropriate assurances of compliance from the manufacturers of these products  and to modify or replace all non compliant products 
the company made inquiries with critical third party providers of intermediary products or services to determine the impact of year issues on their business and operations  and the resulting impact on the business and operations of the company 
certain of these systems relate to the ability of the company to transmit its products to its customers via the internet and by cd rom  and are reliant on the compliance of the third parties in order to operate past the company has been advised by the applicable third parties that the necessary modifications for the year issue have been completed or will be completed by the end of in addition  the company believes that its internal systems are year compliant to interface with such third parties 
however  the company can offer no assurance that its systems  to the extent they are reliant on third party systems  will be operational on january  the company has contacted most of the suppliers of its other software and systems to determine whether the products obtained by the company are year compliant and is currently reviewing other areas within its business and operations which could be adversely affected by year issues 
based on the responses the company has received from manufacturers and the internal evaluation performed through march  the company believes that it will be able to upgrade or replace any critical year deficient software or systems prior to the end of among the systems being reviewed is the company s current telephone system  which is critical to the function of the business 
the company currently plans to replace its existing telephone system during also  in response to the increase in clients and employees  and the need for improved information management for customer service  the company expects to complete implementation of a new client information system during the first half of in selecting the new client information system  year compliance was one of the criteria reviewed  and the company has obtained a representation from the vendor that the system is year compliant 
currently  the company has not identified any internal non it systems that are both critical to the business and would cause significant disruption of business in the event of failure in the year costs to address year issues based on the company s internal evaluation performed to date on potential costs for completing the evaluating  testing  modifying or replacing of any of its internal it or non it software or systems  the company currently expects to spend approximately million including million of costs for replacing the client information system and telephone system  of which the company has spent approximately million as of december  the company will fund all year compliance costs from existing working capital 
the potential costs associated with failure of the internet or other major systems outside the company s control ie  utilities  telephone service  etc  or of any significant non it systems  including increased costs of doing business  inability to conduct business  potential loss of customers  and impact of certain risk areas as discussed below  are unknown and cannot be estimated by the company 
risks associated with year issue the primary risk to the company in the event of non compliance with year issues is a disruption of customer fulfillment 
as a significant portion of the company s clients choose to have the company s products delivered via the internet  failure of that system could prevent customers from accessing the company s products via the company s internet site 
likewise  failure of the telephone systems would prevent the company from speaking with its customers directly  which is an integral part of the company s service and products 
also  failure of the client information system would result in potential delays in responding to customers inquiries 
in addition to the risks to the company s systems as they relate to customer service  and discussed above  the year issue presents the following business risks to the company o because the company s business results from selling knowledge based research on a wide variety of it issues  the short term demand for certain of the company s products could potentially be hindered while customers and potential customers focus immediate resources on fixing their own year issues 
although the company s products include advisory services on the year issue itself  and therefore could potentially increase business for the company  such impacts can not be estimated by the company at this time 
as such  there remains a risk that a shift in the focus of customers and potential customers discretionary it spending could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
o part of the company s services to its customers involves forming opinions and making suggestions with regards to it issues 
as such  customers rely on the company for advice when making it related decisions  which may involve year issues 
because of the overall risk of litigation associated with the year issue  there exists a risk that the company could face legal action from a customer or be named as a co defendant in an action by a third party against a customer 
the likelihood of such action occurring  and the potential related costs  cannot be estimated by the company at this time 
o failure of certain systems of third parties due to year issues could potentially create the risk of impairment of certain assets of the company 
in particular  the company currently has approximately million in marketable securities  which are primarily invested in unsecured  short term investment grade  corporate debt instruments commercial paper 
financial impairment to certain entities in which the company has a minority investment  or a collapse of the securities markets in general  would potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
in addition  the company currently has over million in accounts receivable from customers and international sales representative organizations  as well as significant investments in other companies 
financial impairment to certain of such companies due to year issues could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the likelihood of such action occurring  and the potential related costs  cannot be estimated by the company at this time 
contingency plans the company has the following contingency plans in place in order to protect customer service in the event of year disruptions o the company s research is available in written form as well as via the internet and cd rom 
in the event of disruption of the other forms of delivery  the company will deliver research in printed form to all customers 
the incremental cost of doing so would not be material to the results of operations and is currently an option many customers continue to use 
o in the event the company is unable to replace the existing client information system prior to the end of  the company intends to upgrade the existing system to be year compliant prior to the end of o in the event the company is unable to replace the existing phone system prior to the end of  the company intends to upgrade the existing system to be year compliant prior to the end of the company does not currently have a contingency plan in the event of a failure of long distance telephone service in general 
the company does not currently have a contingency plan in place with regards to the risk of asset impairment described above but will be reviewing investment risk to include year exposure as we approach the year certain factors that may affect future results the company does not provide forecasts of its future financial performance 
from time to time  however  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this form k and in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning the shift in client business demand and the resulting impact on total revenues  the growth rates of continuous services revenue and revenue from consulting and non subscription publications  growth in international revenues  anticipated operating expense levels and such expense levels relative to the company s total revenues  anticipated capital expenditure levels  working capital investment and capital expenditure requirements  year readiness and anticipated year compliance costs constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed within this form k and in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k  as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue  operating expense levels  growth rates and other anticipated expenditures 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the detailed information in this form k and in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this form k and presented by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on renewals of subscription based services the company derived approximately of its total revenues in from subscriptions to the company s continuous services 
in the year ended december   the company derived approximately of its total revenues from subscriptions to its continuous services 
approximately seventy five percent of the company s continuous service clients renewed at least one subscription in and the company  however  may not be successful in maintaining its subscription renewal rates 
during the company experienced a shifting client demand towards more consultative  solution oriented products 
with the advent of the internet  information alone  without analysis in context of a client s environment  will have less value 
in addition to this  the company s ability to renew subscriptions is subject to a number of risks  including the following o the company may be unsuccessful in delivering consistent  high quality and timely analysis and advice to its clients 
o the company may not be able to hire and retain a large and growing number of highly talented professionals in a very competitive job market 
o the company may be unsuccessful in understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of its clients 
o the company may not be able to deliver products and services of the quality and timeliness to withstand competition 
if the company is unable to successfully maintain its subscription renewal rates or sustain the necessary level of performance  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
potential fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company expects future operating results to fluctuate due to several factors  many of which are not in the company s control o the disproportionately large portion of the company s continuous services subscriptions that expire in the fourth quarter of each year  o the level and timing of renewals of subscriptions to the company s continuous services  o the mix of continuous services versus the consulting and publications business  o the timing and amount of new business generated by the company  o the mix of domestic versus international business  o the timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  o the timing of the hiring of research analysts  consultants  and sales representatives  o changes in the spending patterns of the company s clients  o the company s accounts receivable collection experience  o changes in market demand for it research and analysis  and o competitive conditions in the industry 
due to these factors  the company believes period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results of operations 
the potential fluctuations in the company s operating results make it likely that  in some future quarter  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
risks associated with international operations net revenues attributable to international clients represented approximately of the company s total continuous services revenues for the year ended december  and approximately of the company s total continuous services revenues for the year ended december  the company sells its products internationally through a network of independent sales representative organizations 
the company assumes significantly greater risk by selling through independent sales representative organizations than through a direct employee sales force 
these risks to the company include o greater accounts receivable collection risk because the company relies on the sales representative organization to invoice and collect receivables  o longer accounts receivable collection cycles  o the financial health of individual sales representative organizations  o developing and managing relationships with sales representative organizations  o greater difficulty in maintaining direct client contact  o fluctuations in exchange rates  o political  social  and economic conditions in various jurisdictions  o tariffs and other trade barriers  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company expects that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues and intends to continue to expand its international operations 
expansion into new geographic territories may require considerable management and financial resources and may negatively impact the company s near term results of operations 
if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international operations  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
risks of failing to anticipate changing market needs the company s success depends in part upon its ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt its products and services to meet the changing information and analysis needs of it users 
during the company experienced a shifting client demand towards more consultative  solution oriented products 
with the advent of the internet  information alone  without analysis in context of a client s environment  will have less value 
in addition to this  frequent and often dramatic changes  including the following  characterize the it industry o introduction of new products and obsolescence of others  o shifting strategies and market positions of major industry participants  o paradigm shifts with respect to system architectures  and o changing objectives and expectations of it users and vendors 
this environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to the company s ability to provide its clients with current and timely analysis and advice on issues of importance to them 
the company commits substantial resources to meeting these challenges 
if the company fails to provide insightful timely analysis of developments and assessment of technologies and trends in a manner that meets changing market needs  such a failure could have a material and adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
dependence on ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the company needs to hire  train and retain a significant number of additional qualified employees to execute its strategy and support its growth 
in particular  the company needs trained research analysts  consultants  sales representatives and product development and operations staff 
the company continues to experience intense competition in recruiting and retaining qualified employees 
the pool of experienced candidates is small  and  the company competes for qualified employees against many companies  including gartner group  that have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
if the company is unable to successfully hire  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
competition the it research and analysis industry is extremely competitive 
the company competes directly with other independent providers of similar services and indirectly with the internal staffs of current and prospective client organizations 
the company s principal direct competitor  gartner group  has a substantially longer operating history and has considerably greater financial resources and market share than the company 
the company also competes indirectly with larger electronic and print media companies and consulting firms 
the company s indirect competitors  many of which have substantially greater financial  information gathering and marketing resources than the company  could choose to compete directly against the company in the future 
the company s market has few barriers to entry 
new competitors could easily compete against the company in one or more market segments addressed by the company s continuous services 
the company s current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more effective than the company s products 
competitors may also produce their products and services at less cost and market them more effectively 
if the company is unable to successfully compete against existing or new competitors  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and would likely result in pricing pressure and loss of market share 
risks associated with new product development the company s future success depends on its ability to develop or acquire new products and services that address specific industry and business sectors  changes in client requirements and technological changes in the it industry 
the process of internally researching  developing  launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service is inherently risky and costly 
assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service is also risky and costly 
during the company experienced a shifting client demand towards more consultative  solution oriented products 
with the advent of the internet  information alone  without analysis in context of a client s environment  will have less value 
in addition to this  the company has introduced few new products or services and has had limited experience in managing strategic investments 
from april to december  the company invested million in several companies whose products  services and or distribution channels complement the company s business 
if the company is unable to develop new products and services or manage its strategic investments  such inabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
dependence on key personnel the company relies  and will continue to rely  in large part on its key management  research  consulting  sales  product development and operations personnel 
the company s success in part depends on its ability to motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
if dale kutnick president  chief executive officer and co research director and or other senior officers of the company leave the company  such loss or losses could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risk of product pricing limiting potential market the company s pricing strategy may limit the potential market for the company s continuous services to substantial commercial and governmental users and vendors of it 
as a result  the company may be required to reduce prices for its continuous services or to introduce new products with lower prices in order to expand or maintain its market share 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
management of growth since inception  the company s operations have changed substantially due to the expansion and growth of the company s business 
growth places significant demands on the company s management  administrative  operational and financial resources 
the company s ability to manage growth  should it continue to occur  will require the company to continue to improve its systems and to motivate and effectively manage an evolving workforce 
if the company s management is unable to effectively manage a changing and growing business  the quality of the company s products  its retention of key employees and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
risk of failure to integrate recent acquisition and risks associated with potential acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company buys  or makes investments in  complementary businesses  products and services 
if the company finds a business it wishes to acquire  the company could have difficulty negotiating the terms of the purchase  financing the purchase  and assimilating the employees  products and operations of the acquired business 
acquisitions may disrupt the ongoing business of the company and distract management 
furthermore  acquisition of new businesses may not lead to the successful development of new products  or if developed  such products may not achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable 
a given acquisition may also have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company may be required to incur debt or issue equity to pay for any future acquisitions 
in october  the company acquired sentry  an it consulting company 
the sentry acquisition required extensive management time with respect to the negotiation and consummation of the transaction 
the company expects that the time and costs associated with the integration of the sentry business into the company s existing mgc division will be significant 
the company may not be able to successfully integrate the sentry business  and any such inability could have a material adverse affect on the company s operations and financial results
