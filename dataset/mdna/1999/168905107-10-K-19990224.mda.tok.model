for example  references to fiscal mean the fiscal year ended january  fiscal was a week year 
the provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal reflected the reversal of a valuation allowance of million on a net deferred tax asset 
the extraordinary gain during fiscal represented the forgiveness of debt in connection with a debt restructuring undertaken with the consent of our creditors 
the extraordinary loss in fiscal represented the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized debt discount as a result of the repayment of long term debt in conjunction with our initial public offering in september diluted net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding 
the weighted average common shares outstanding and common share equivalents used in computing diluted net income per common share for fiscal are based on the number of common shares and common share equivalents as if our recapitalization at the time of our initial public offering had occurred on the first day of fiscal during and prior to the fiscal year ended february   our common stock was not publicly traded and the significant changes in our capital structure resulting from a private placement of our common stock in july as discussed in note private placement in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the private placement  earnings per share for that year and earlier periods is not presented due to a lack of comparability 
we define comparable store sales as net sales from stores that have been open for more than full months and that have not been substantially remodeled during that time 
for purposes of determining the comparable store sales increase  average net sales per store and average net sales per gross square foot  fiscal results were recalculated based on a week year 
represents net sales from stores open throughout the full period divided by the number of such stores 
average square footage per store represents the square footage of stores open on the last day of the period divided by the number of such stores 
represents net sales from stores open throughout the full period divided by the gross square footage of such stores 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto included as item the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors 
overview the children s place retail stores  inc is a specialty retailer of apparel and accessories for children from newborn to twelve years of age 
as of february   we operated stores in states  located primarily in regional shopping malls in the eastern half of the united states 
in fiscal  we began to implement an aggressive growth strategy designed to capitalize on our business strengths and strong store economics 
from july  through the end of fiscal  we opened stores and closed one store  growing to stores 
during fiscal and fiscal  we opened a total of and new stores  respectively 
the majority of these stores were opened in existing and contiguous markets 
in fiscal  we also entered into several new markets  including atlanta  st 
louis and kansas city 
we intend to continue our expansion program and currently plan to open at least stores in fiscal and at least stores in fiscal our store expansion program will continue to focus on expanding our presence in existing and contiguous markets 
we also plan to open stores in several new markets colorado  utah and northern florida in fiscal  and northern california  washington  oregon  southern florida  louisiana and texas in fiscal our net sales have grown significantly during the past several years  primarily as a result of new store openings and  to a lesser extent  increases in comparable store sales 
we define our comparable store sales as net sales from stores that have been open for more than full months and that have not been substantially remodeled during that time 
we reported comparable store sales growth over prior years of    and during fiscal    and  respectively 
we believe that these increases were primarily the result of successful merchandising and operational programs  together with well positioned store real estate 
we do not expect our comparable store sales to continue to increase at rates similar to those experienced in fiscal in order to support our aggressive growth strategy  we continue to assess and build our administrative infrastructure and our management information and distribution systems 
during fiscal  we added resources in virtually all of our administrative functions to support our present and planned store growth 
during fiscal  we plan to implement an automated warehouse management system and to replace our point of sale software and hardware 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we also plan to move to a larger distribution center and corporate headquarters in secaucus  new jersey 
this relocation will support our need for additional space for our distribution center and administrative staff 
since our current facilities and equipment have a low net book value  we expect only a small write off in conjunction with this move 
in fiscal  we also plan to implement a new merchandise presentation strategy  and to upgrade the display fixtures and other elements of our store design in approximately two thirds of our existing stores  in order to simplify  facilitate and enhance the shopping experience of our customers 
during fiscal  we accelerated depreciation expense by approximately million for store fixtures that will be eliminated in connection with the refixturing 
we expect to accelerate depreciation expense by approximately million during fiscal to complete this program 
also in fiscal  we plan  through a wholly owned hong kong subsidiary  to open an office in hong kong  which will initially employ eight to ten people  and for which we initially expect to incur an annual cost of million 
we have selected an advertising agency to assist us in developing a new advertising campaign that will include television  print  radio and outdoor advertising 
in fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million to million on this campaign 
we also view the use of our private label credit card as an important marketing and communication tool 
our private label card sales accounted for approximately of our fiscal net sales 
giving effect to the expenditures to be made in the second quarter of fiscal specified above  we may report a higher net loss for the second quarter of fiscal than we reported for the second quarter of fiscal consequently  during the second quarter of fiscal  we may report a higher loss per share than we did for the second quarter of fiscal in addition  the occupancy expense of a larger distribution center and corporate headquarters  the overlap in rent expense between our old and new facility and the cost of relocating to the new facility will adversely affect our results of operations for the second quarter of fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended february  january  january  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses pre opening costs depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net other expense  net income before income taxes and extraordinary item provision benefit for income taxes extraordinary loss net income number of stores  end of period year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal net sales for the new stores opened  as well as other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores  contributed million of the sales increase

during fiscal  we entered several new markets  including atlanta  st 
louis and kansas city 
our comparable store sales increased and contributed million to the net sales increase during fiscal comparable store sales increased during fiscal our fiscal comparable store sales increase was experienced across all major merchandise departments 
gross profit increased by million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to during fiscal from during fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was principally due to higher initial markups achieved through more effective product sourcing and a stronger dollar  as well as to lower markdowns 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was also favorably impacted by a leveraging of store occupancy  buying and distribution expenses over a higher sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales during fiscal from of net sales during fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in our administrative infrastructure to support our growth and higher marketing expenses to promote consumer recognition of the children s place brand 
in addition  our incentive payouts in fiscal were higher  and higher as a percentage of net sales  as our increased operating performance for that year resulted in the payment of higher incentive bonuses than were paid in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by the leveraging of store expenses over a higher sales base 
during fiscal  pre opening costs were million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in pre opening costs in fiscal reflected the opening of stores  as compared to stores during fiscal pre opening expenses for fiscal also reflect certain expenses incurred for approximately stores we plan to open during the first quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization amounted to million  or of net sales  during fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily was a result of the increase in stores 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales during fiscal reflects the leverage of depreciation and amortization expense over a higher sales base 
interest expense  net  for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the decrease in interest expense  net  was primarily due to the elimination of interest expense on our long term debt  which was repaid with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering  and lower borrowings and effective interest rates under our working capital revolving credit facility 
other expense  net  for fiscal and fiscal was million and consisted of anniversary fees related to our working capital revolving credit facility during both periods 
during fiscal  a provision for income taxes of million was recorded  as compared to million during fiscal due to the utilization of our nols  the majority of our tax provision will not be paid in cash 
however  we expect to make cash payments of approximately million for our fiscal taxes related to the payment of taxes based on the federal alternative minimum tax  state minimum taxes and state taxes for states in which we did not have nols 
we expect to utilize the remaining million of our nols during fiscal as a result of the repayment of our long term debt with a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering  we recorded a non cash extraordinary item of million  net of taxes  for fiscal that represented the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized debt discount 
the children s place had net income of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
year ended january  compared to year ended february  net sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal net sales for the new stores opened  as well as other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores  contributed million of the sales increase  partially offset by the closing of one store during which contributed million of net sales during fiscal our comparable store sales increased and contributed million of the sales increase during fiscal comparable store sales increased during fiscal the company s fiscal comparable store sales increase was primarily attributable to strength in the infant and big girl departments  partially offset by weaker sales in the little boy and little girl departments 
gross profit increased by million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was principally due to higher markdowns which were required to clear excess inventory 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was also unfavorably impacted by higher store occupancy costs partially offset by a higher initial markup 
the increased store occupancy costs resulted from new stores that had not been open long enough to leverage their rent through an established sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales during fiscal from of net sales during fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower corporate administrative expenses which benefited from the leverage of the increased sales base  partially offset by higher store payroll and other store expenses

our provision for income taxes for fiscal reflected a provision based on effective statutory rates 
throughout fiscal  our provision for income taxes provided for the payment of federal alternative minimum taxes and minimum taxes in most states due to the utilization of our nols 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed a million valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
the majority of the fiscal tax provision was not paid in cash 
however  we made cash tax payments for the federal alternative minimum tax  state minimum taxes and state taxes for states in which we did not have nols 
as a result of the repayment of our long term debt with a portion of the net proceeds from the initial public offering  we recorded a non cash extraordinary item of million  net of taxes  for fiscal that represented the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized debt discount 
the children s place had net income of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources debt service liquidity during fiscal  our primary uses of cash were financing new store openings and providing for working capital  which primarily represents the purchase of inventory 
our working capital needs follow a seasonal pattern  peaking during the second and third quarters when inventory is purchased for the back to school and holiday merchandise lines 
we have been able to meet our cash needs principally by using cash flow from operations and borrowings under our working capital revolving credit facility 
since our initial public offering  we have had no long term debt obligations other than obligations under capital leases 
we have a working capital revolving credit facility with foothill capital corporation that provides for borrowings up to million including a sublimit for letters of credit of million 
the amount that may be borrowed under our working capital revolving credit facility depends upon our levels of inventory and accounts receivable 
amounts outstanding under the facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate or  at our option  the day libor rate plus a pre determined spread 
the libor spread is or  depending upon our financial performance from time to time 
borrowings under the facility mature in july and provide for one year automatic renewal options 
as of january   there were no borrowings under our working capital revolving credit facility and  as of january   million was borrowed under the working capital revolving credit facility 
in addition  as of january  and january   we had outstanding million and million  respectively  in letters of credit under our working capital revolving credit facility 
availability under the working capital revolving credit facility as of january  and january  was million and million  respectively 
as of january  and january  the interest rates charged under the working capital revolving credit facility were and per annum  respectively 
our working capital revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants including  among others  the maintenance of minimum levels of tangible net worth  working capital and current ratios  and imposes certain limitations on our annual capital expenditures  as defined in the working capital revolving credit facility  as well as a prohibition on the payment of dividends 
credit extended under the working capital revolving credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in our present and future assets 
we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our working capital revolving credit facility as of january  cash flows capital expenditures cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of an increase in operating earnings  the utilization of our nols and increases in current liabilities  partially offset by an increased investment in inventory to support the store expansion program 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of an increase in operating earnings and accounts payable  partially offset by an increased inventory investment 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to store openings and remodelings 
in fiscal  and  we opened  and stores while remodeling  and stores  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal  and also include ongoing store capital programs and computer equipment for our corporate headquarters 
during fiscal  capital expenditures also included capital expenditures related to the upcoming relocation of the distribution center and corporate headquarters facility  a warehouse management system  and new point of sale software and hardware 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash flows provided by financing activities reflected funds received from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases partially offset by a net repayment of our working capital revolving credit facility 
in fiscal  cash flows provided by financing activities resulted from our initial public offering  offset by the repayment of our long term debt and the repurchase of certain warrants 
in fiscal  cash flows provided by financing activities resulted from the private placement 
the net proceeds of the private placement were used to redeem certain outstanding shares of common stock  repay existing long term debt and reduce outstanding borrowings under our working capital revolving credit facility 
we have entered into an eight year lease with a three year option period for a distribution center and corporate headquarters facility located in secaucus  new jersey 
the lease also provides us with an option to terminate the lease after the fifth year 
we plan to relocate our distribution center and corporate headquarters during the second quarter of fiscal we believe this distribution center will support approximately stores 
we expect to make a cash outlay of approximately million to renovate the facility  of which million was spent in fiscal we also plan to install a new warehouse management system at a total cost of approximately million  of which million was spent in fiscal the existing distribution center and corporate headquarters facility lease expires in march we have extended our lease arrangement for our existing distribution and corporate headquarters to cover the period until our operations are relocated to the new facility 
in a typical new store  capital expenditures net of landlord contribution  initial inventory net of merchandise payables and pre opening costs approximate million 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal these expenditures will relate primarily to the opening of at least stores  the renovation of our new distribution center and corporate headquarters  store remodelings and refixturings  ongoing store maintenance programs and computer and warehouse systems and equipment 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds available under our working capital revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital and other cash flow requirements for at least the next months 
in addition  as we continue our store expansion program we will consider additional sources of financing to fund our long term growth 
although we are complying  and believe that we will be able to comply  with the financial covenants under our working capital revolving credit facility  we are seeking to provide greater financial flexibility as we implement our growth strategy 
consequently  we have requested an increase in our credit line under the working capital revolving credit facility and amendments to the financial covenants contained in the credit facility 
our ability to meet our capital requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations and successfully implement our store expansion plans 
quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings and related pre opening and other startup costs  net sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  weather conditions  shifts in timing of certain holidays  changes in our merchandise mix and overall economic conditions 
our business is also subject to seasonal influences  with heavier concentrations of sales during the back to school and holiday seasons 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  we typically experience lower net sales and net income during the first two fiscal quarters  and net sales and net income are lower during the second fiscal quarter than during the first fiscal quarter 
our first quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the easter holiday 
our third quarter results are heavily dependent upon back to school sales and our fourth quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the holiday season 
we have experienced first and second quarter losses in the past and expect to experience second quarter losses in the future 
because of these fluctuations in net sales and net income loss  the results of operations of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data and operating data for each of our last eight fiscal quarters 
the quarterly statement of operations data and selected operating data set forth below were derived from our unaudited financial statements and reflect  in our opinion  all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for these fiscal quarters 
fiscal first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter in thousands  except for share and store data net sales     operating income loss     comparable store sales increase decrease stores open at end of period fiscal first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter in thousands  except for share and store data net sales     operating income loss    comparable store sales increase stores open at end of period year compliance the year issue exists because many computer applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems may not properly recognize and process the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in normal business processing 
during fiscal  we began a program to ensure that our operations would not be adversely impacted by software and other system and equipment failures related to the year during the second quarter of fiscal  we engaged the services of a consulting firm to help ensure that we had fully assessed the risks associated with the year and to assist in the development of a comprehensive implementation plan 
in addition  we established a project team to coordinate and address the year issue 
the year project has been divided into four phases inventory and risk assessment  remediation of non compliant systems  equipment and suppliers  implementation and testing  and contingency planning 
the inventory and risk assessment phase of the year project is complete 
during this phase  we assessed our information systems hardware and software  equipment containing date sensitive embedded chips  electronic data interchange and the year preparedness of our key suppliers and service providers 
our plans call for our critical information systems to be year compliant by the end of the second quarter of fiscal we believe that approximately of our systems are currently year compliant 
we plan to rely primarily on our existing management information systems staff supplemented by outside consultants to modify  replace and test systems for year compliance 
during fiscal  we incurred external costs of approximately million in connection with our year compliance and expect to incur an additional million in external costs in fiscal in addition  we utilized approximately million in internal management information systems resources during fiscal and expect to utilize a similar amount of internal management information systems resources in fiscal the cost of year remediation is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business in future periods 
contingency plans are being developed to provide uninterrupted management information systems support in the event that we are unable to replace our warehouse management system  point of sale system and general ledger systems 
we have completed our initial assessment of the year preparedness of our service providers and key suppliers through written communications  oral communications and visual inspection 
despite these efforts  we cannot assure the timely compliance of these service providers and suppliers and may be adversely affected by a failure of a significant third party to become year compliant 
additionally  since we procure most of our merchandise from foreign sources  we are also at risk to the extent foreign suppliers and infrastructures are not properly prepared to handle the year contingency plans are in process to mitigate the risk of dependence on foreign suppliers and distribution channels through an accelerated receipt of merchandise for the spring selling season 
we anticipate that we will incur approximately million in additional inventory carrying costs associated with the earlier receipt of this merchandise 
we believe that the accelerated receipt of inventory should mitigate the risk of a material failure to receive our merchandise for re sale 
although we are working to minimize any business disruption caused by the year  we may be adversely impacted by a failure related to the year these risks include  but are not limited to  power and communications disruptions  failures of our information technology systems  the inability of a significant supplier or service provider to become year compliant and disruptions in the distribution channels including both foreign and domestic ports  customs  and transportation vendors 
as noted above  we are currently developing our contingency plans which will allow for the continuation of business operations in the event that we or any of our significant suppliers or service providers do not properly address year issues 
we expect to have a completed plan by the end of the second quarter of fiscal where needed  we will modify our contingency plans based on the test results of our information systems hardware and software  the timeliness of replacement system implementations and the ongoing assessment of risk associated with third party suppliers and service providers 
the cost of the conversions and the completion dates set forth above are based on management s estimates and may be updated as additional information becomes available
