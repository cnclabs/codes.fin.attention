as a result  the financial statements of the company prior to july  have been carved out from the financial statements of m using the historical results of operations and historical basis of the assets and liabilities of such businesses 
the company s statements of operations prior to july  include all of the related costs of doing business  including charges for the use of facilities and for employee benefits  and include an allocation of certain general corporate expenses of m which were not directly related to these businesses  including costs for corporate logistics  corporate research and development  information technologies  finance  legal and corporate executives 
management believes these allocations were made on a reasonable basis 
the financial information included herein for periods prior to july   may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company had the company been a separate  independent company during the periods presented 
on november   the company sold its worldwide medical imaging business to kodak 
as a result  the company s consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows for include only eleven months of the medical imaging business results 
the company retained its manufacturing facility in ferrania  italy  from which the company agreed to manufacture x ray and wet laser medical imaging film for kodak for a minimum of two years under a supply agreement which became effective on november  the following table displays the company s results of operations for  and  as reported  compared to adjusted results which exclude the gain on the sale of the medical imaging business  restructuring and other special charges  acquisition related charges and other year end adjustments  as applicable 
reported and adjusted results also include certain expenses previously classified as selling  general and administrative expenses reclassified as cost of goods sold in current and prior years financial statements  with no impact on net income loss in any year

percentage of revenue excluding gain on sale of medical imaging  restructuring and other percentage of dollar increase special charges decrease vs vs net revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating income non operating expense  net income tax provision net income net revenues net revenues in  and were  million   million and  million  respectively 
net revenues decreased percent in compared to a decrease of percent in revenues declined in primarily due to continuing price erosion  lack of one month of the medical imaging business and  to a lesser extent  unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates 
volume increases in asia were offset by declines in canada and europe 
the company expects revenues to be positively impacted by growth in certain products in the data storage business  including network products dlt tape offerings and travan ns tm technologies and mobile and desktop products superdisk tm  as well as growth in the digital solutions and services business areas of digital asset management and operational services 
approximately percent of the company s net revenues in were from sales outside the united states compared to percent in and percent in gross profit gross profit for was million 
gross profit for was million  which includes the impact of million in special charges related primarily to the write down of inventory 
gross profit for was million  which includes the impact of million in special charges primarily related to the write off of certain packaging materials in connection with the distribution 
gross profit was percent of revenues in excluding the impact of special charges  gross profit in and would have been million and million  or percent and percent of revenues  respectively 
the relatively consistent level of gross margin percentage reflects the company s ability to offset negative effects of price erosion with productivity improvements 
as previously discussed  gross profit includes certain expenses previously classified as selling  general and administrative expenses reclassified as cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses in  and  selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses were percent of revenues in excluding special charges of million in and million in  selling  general and administrative expenses would have been million and million  or percent and percent of revenues  in and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is due to the decline in revenues  the company s investment in its superdisk tm program and costs attributable to the company s it infrastructure development  partially offset by benefits resulting from the company s restructuring program 
the and selling  general and administrative expenses include million and million  respectively  of start up costs related to designing and implementing more efficient business processes and developing the company s brand identity 
in  the company began amortizing capitalized software development costs associated with the design  testing and implementation of the company s new it systems 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
expenses in include a non tax deductible charge of million for acquired in process research and development costs related to the company s acquisition of cemax  while expenses include a non tax deductible charge of million for acquired in process research and development costs related to the company s acquisition of luminous 
research and development expenses were percent of revenues in excluding the impact of acquisition related charges  research and development expenses in and would have been million and million or percent and percent of revenues  respectively 
the decrease in expenses of million excluding special charges compared with  reflects the impact of the company s restructuring program 
the decrease in expenses of million excluding special charges compared with  is due to research and development cost structure improvements 
gain on sale of medical imaging business and related charges in  the company sold its worldwide medical imaging business to kodak 
the company recorded a pre tax gain of million on the sale  net of related costs 
these costs include the impairment of certain manufacturing assets which were not sold to kodak of million  determined based on estimated recoverable costs 
in addition  these costs include the write off of capitalized software costs of approximately million which were directly related to the medical imaging business  reflecting the abandonment of certain functionality and utility  pension and other curtailment and settlement costs related to employees transferred to kodak of million and other direct costs of the transaction 
restructuring the company recorded restructuring charges of million and million in and  respectively 
these charges relate to the company s reorganization and restructuring activities and include costs associated with employee separation benefits  fixed asset write offs  and other business exit costs 
in  the company recorded a million net benefit in the restructuring line of the statement of operations  consisting of a million benefit reflecting final adjustments of the restructuring reserves established in the fourth quarter of and a million reversal of restructuring reserves established in the fourth quarter of  offset by million of new charges  primarily related to asset write downs 
the million adjustment to the restructuring charge resulted primarily from three factors a better than expected result from the sale of the company s cd rom business  lower than expected costs from closing certain research and development facilities primarily the facility in the united kingdom and lower than expected costs associated with employee terminations 
operating income loss operating income for was million 
operating loss for and was million and million  respectively 
operating income in was benefited by the restructuring reversals and the gain on the sale of the medical imaging business and related charges discussed above 
the operating losses in and were negatively impacted by the restructuring and other special charges discussed above 
excluding these gains and charges  operating income would have been million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease of million in reflects a decline in data storage as the company invested in its superdisk tm program  offset by an increase in medical imaging 
the decrease of million in reflects lower gross profit and higher selling  general and administrative costs offset by lower research and development costs 
non operating expense non operating expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in is due to investment income and reduced currency transaction losses  offset by the increase in interest expense on outstanding borrowings 
also  in connection with the termination of the company s revolving credit agreement  the company incurred million of costs primarily related to the interest swap agreement 
the increase in was primarily due to increased interest expense on outstanding borrowings and foreign currency transaction losses 
the company utilizes certain financial instruments to manage risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency risks 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of financial instruments held by the company 
income tax excluding the gain on the sale of the medical imaging business  restructuring and other special charges  the company s effective tax rate was percent using the same tax rates applied to reported results  percent and percent of pre tax income for  and  respectively 
while the company continues to earn profits in high tax jurisdictions  future profits and the benefits of a tax effective structure are expected to decrease future tax rates 
the company has performed an analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets and has recorded valuation allowances for certain amounts not considered recoverable 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  of million 
the future recoverability of the company s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  primarily in the u 
s 
the company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to recover the company s recorded net deferred tax assets 
net income loss net income for was million or per share  compared with a net loss for of million or per share  and a net loss of million or per share in excluding the gain on the sale of the medical imaging business  restructuring and other special charges  net income would have been million or per share  million or per share and million or per share  in  and  respectively 
performance by geographic area in  united states net revenues totaled  million  down percent from  million in due primarily to price erosion 
in  international net revenues totaled million  down percent from  million in  due to price erosion and unfavorable currency translation  offset slightly by volume increases 
performance by segments the company s current businesses are organized  managed and internally reported as three segments differentiated primarily by their products and services  but also by the markets they serve 
these segments  whose results are shown below  are data storage and information management  product technologies and digital solutions and services 
in addition  the company owned and managed a fourth segment  medical imaging  which was sold to kodak effective november  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results for this segment are also included below through the date of sale 
data storage and information management data storage and information management net revenues of million for  decreased million from  which had declined million from these decreases were driven by the company s more mature mobile and desktop products  including standard diskettes and desktop tape cartridges  offset partially by increases in net revenues from superdisk tm drives and diskettes  as well as by certain network and enterprise data center products 
s operating loss of million represented a profitability decline of million from operating income of million in this decline was driven primarily by the company s investment in superdisk tm and other data storage technologies and  to a lesser extent  by declines in other mobile and desktop products 
operating income declined by million from the prior year driven primarily by declines in desktop tape and optical products 
product technologies product technologies net revenues declined million to million in compared to declines were experienced across most major product categories 
net revenues in decreased million to million from the prior year driven primarily by declines in printing plates and film and  to a lesser extent  by photo color products 
operating income of million declined million from  which was up million from the increase in was driven primarily by improvements in color proofing products 
beginning in december  the operating results from the supply agreement for the manufacture of certain medical imaging products are included in the product technologies segment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
digital solutions and services digital solutions and services net revenues of million declined million from  with declines experienced across most product and service platforms 
net revenues remained relatively unchanged from at million 
operating loss was million versus operating income of million in  reflecting investments in new business opportunities 
operating income was relatively unchanged from medical imaging divested business medical imaging net revenues of million increased million from medical imaging revenues include months of results as the business was sold to kodak on november  net revenues of million increased million from these increases were driven by dryview tm products partially offset by decreases in conventional x ray and wet electronics imaging film products 
operating income of million in improved from an operating loss in of million 
this improvement was driven by dryview tm and  to a lesser extent  by conventional x ray and wet electronics imaging film products  partially offset by profit declines in the company s medical solutions business 
showed an operating loss of million 
financial position in general  most balance sheet accounts as of december  decreased as a result of the sale of the medical imaging business see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company had months of inventory on hand at december  excluding the effect of the medical imaging business sold on november   compared to months at december  this decrease is primarily related to improved inventory management as well as certain products which were in backorder 
the sale of the medical imaging business had no significant impact on the decrease in the months of inventory on hand 
the accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso was days at december   excluding the effect of the medical imaging business sold on november   up from days at december  the december  dso calculation now excludes the medical imaging business  which carried a higher average dso 
despite the benefit from excluding the medical imaging business  dso still increased by four days driven by transitory timing impacts of the it implementation 
other current assets were million at december  compared to million at december  this increase is primarily due to million of restricted cash from the sale of the medical imaging business see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the net book value of property  plant and equipment at december  was million  a decrease of million from million at december  this decrease is due to the sale of medical imaging assets and the disposal of assets as part of the company s reorganization and restructuring process  offset by a million increase related to the purchase of the company s research and development facility previously under a synthetic lease structure 
liquidity cash used in operating activities was million in  while cash provided by operating activities was million in and million in the adjustments to net income included depreciation and amortization of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and a net restructuring benefit of million in restructuring and other special charges totaled million and million in and  respectively 
changes in working capital used million and million of cash in and  respectively  and provided million of cash in during the company made net cash payments related to restructuring charges of approximately million 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  with million and million used in and  respectively 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in the company sold its worldwide medical imaging business to kodak for approximately million in cash  of which million is restricted until the european businesses are legally transferred to kodak 
the company expects these legal transfers to be completed in the first half of in addition  proceeds from the sale of other businesses were million 
capital spending totaled million in  which includes million for the purchase of the company s research and development facility previously under a synthetic lease structure 
the company expects capital spending in to be approximately million 
the company also capitalized million  million and million of software expenditures in  and  respectively  primarily related to the development  testing and implementation of the company s new it systems 
net cash paid in and related to business acquisitions totaled million and million  respectively 
prior to july   cash and equivalents and debt were not allocated to the company from m since m used a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations 
the company s financing requirements prior to july  are represented by cash transactions with m and are reflected in net cash paid to m in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
this financial support was discontinued following the distribution 
at december   the company had outstanding borrowing of million under its million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit agreement 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company obtained waivers of compliance with and amendment of certain financial covenants through january  under the credit agreement to accommodate the restructuring and other special charges recorded in the fourth quarter of during this waiver period  borrowings under the credit agreement were collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets  the company was required to maintain a specified minimum level of earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and the company was subject to increased borrowing margins 
the credit agreement also contained a number of provisions restricting the company s ability to take certain actions  including the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the creation of additional liens  the making of certain restricted payments and the sale of substantial assets of the company 
it also contained certain ongoing reporting requirements  including computations regarding the company s financial condition  absence of events of default and absence of material adverse changes in the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
on january   the company repaid the amounts outstanding and terminated the credit agreement 
on december   the company entered into a three year million loan and security agreement the loan agreement with a group of banks 
the loan agreement provides for a revolving credit  including letters of credit  with borrowing availability based on eligible accounts receivable  inventories and manufacturing machinery and equipment not to exceed million 
borrowing availability at december  was million  of which million was subsequently drawn in connection with the termination of the credit agreement 
the loan agreement is collateralized by substantially all the domestic assets of the company  excluding the land and buildings at the company s headquarters in oakdale  minnesota  and a pledge of percent of the stock of certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
covenants include maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth and borrowing base availability  with certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  sale of assets  mergers and consolidation  transactions with affiliates  creation of liens  and certain other matters 
as of january   the initial funding date of the loan agreement  the company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions 
in addition  certain subsidiaries have arranged borrowings locally outside of the agreements discussed above 
as of december   million of short term borrowings were outstanding under such arrangements 
in march  the company entered into a synthetic lease facility to fund the cost of construction of a new research and development facility at the company s headquarters 
the facility also required that the company comply with the financial covenants contained in the company s credit agreement  or a replacement thereof  provided that any amendment or waiver of such covenants approved by the lenders under the credit agreement was also effective under the synthetic lease facility 
to facilitate entering into the new loan agreement as noted above  the company prepaid this financing and purchased the building in december as of december   the company s ratio of debt to total capital was percent as compared with percent at december  the decrease in the ratio is principally attributable to the debt payments and increase in shareholders equity associated with the sale of the medical imaging business see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects that cash and equivalents  together with cash flow from operations and availability of borrowings under its current and future sources of financing  will provide liquidity sufficient to operate the company 
in february and march of  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to six million shares of the company s common stock 
during the first and second quarters of  approximately million shares were repurchased 
as of december   the company held million shares of treasury stock acquired at an average price of per share 
on january   the company announced an increase in the share repurchase authorization to a total of million shares under which approximately million shares at a cost of million have been subsequently purchased through march  euro conversion status on january   of the member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their new common currency 
the euro is trading on currency exchanges and can be used for noncash transactions 
local currencies will remain legal tender until december  by no later than december   participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills for use in cash transactions 
by no later than july   participating countries will begin using the euro as the legal tender and will withdraw all legacy currencies 
the euro conversion may lead to increased competition between countries and potential erosion of margins as prices in different countries are more readily comparable 
the company is reviewing its marketing strategies to address possible increased competition and is also reviewing and testing its software compatibility with the euro conversion 
the company will continue to review the impact of the conversion to the euro  however  the company does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
market risks the company is exposed to various market risks  including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
these exposures primarily relate to the sale of products to foreign customers  purchases from foreign suppliers  acquisition of raw materials from both domestic and foreign suppliers  and changes in interest rates 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  futures contracts  options and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures when it is considered practical to do so in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
as a global company  changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar affect the company s financial results 
the company  from time to time  enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies  that when remeasured according to generally accepted accounting principles  impact the income statement 
for certain markets  particularly latin america  where forward exchange contracts are not available or determined not to be cost effective  the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk through pricing and working capital management 
there can be no assurances that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of local currencies 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
although the company attempts to utilize transaction hedging to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which the company sells products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which the company incurs costs  the company s sales or costs are adversely impacted 
at december   the company had million notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
a hypothetical adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding at december  by million  however  less than million of this change would impact earnings since the gain loss on the majority of these contracts would be offset by an equal gain loss on the underlying exposures being hedged 
to manage interest rate risk on a portion of the variable rate borrowings under its revolving credit agreement  the company has utilized and in the future may utilize interest rate swaps 
these interest rate swap hedging instruments have the effect of locking in  for a specified period  the base interest rate excluding credit margin the company will pay on the notional principal amount established in the swap 
as a result  while these hedging arrangements are structured to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate increases  they also limit the benefit the company might otherwise have received from any interest rate decreases 
these swaps are usually cash settled quarterly  with interest expense adjusted for amounts paid or received 
the company did not have any interest rate swaps as of december  from time to time  the company has used silver commodity forward contracts  and may use these and other commodity forward contracts  to manage the company s exposure to price risk of commodities used in production 
these commodity forward contract hedging instruments have the effect of locking in  for specified periods  the prices the company will pay for the volumes to which the hedge relates 
as a result  while these hedging arrangements are structured to reduce the company s exposure to price increases  they also limit the benefit the company might otherwise have received from any price decreases associated with the hedged commodity 
these contracts are usually cash settled as opposed to taking physical delivery of the commodity 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts qualifying as hedge instruments are deferred until offsetting gains and losses on the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings as part of cost of goods sold 
the company did not have any commodity forward contracts as of december  year compliance introduction phases in preparation for the change in the millennium  the company s year yk operating team has instituted a seven phase plan to address the company s yk readiness in the following areas internal it systems  non it systems including plants  facilities  process control and building control equipment  communications systems  laboratory and test equipment  etc  the company s products  and external business relationships 
the seven phases of the plan are perform inventory of all items potentially subject to yk effect and prioritize on the basis of business criticality  develop a plan for assessing yk compliance of all inventoried items  determine whether inventoried items are yk compliant  design a remediation strategy eg  remediate  replace  retire  etc 
for non compliant inventoried items and develop contingency plans  develop and test remediation solutions  implement remediation solutions  and document verification of compliance of remediated solutions 
inventories of each area have been completed and determinations have been made regarding yk impact 
inventoried items have been prioritized  assessment plans have been completed and remediation solutions are being developed 
field implementation of remediation solutions for critical yk items is targeted for completion by the end of june  with remediation of least critical items targeted for completion by the end of september verification of compliance of remediated solutions is planned to occur contemporaneously with the field installation of solutions 
contingency plans are being developed to address potential yk related failures that could affect critical company operations 
it system a significant portion of the company s new global it infrastructure has been completed with the remaining portion expected to be completed by september the company required a new it system after the company s spin off from m  and a significant factor in the company s selection of this system was its yk compliance status 
the company believes that the new system will significantly reduce the likelihood of yk related interruptions to normal operations 
the company must  however  test all system software applications added to the new it system and custom code written for the system  as well as certain other systems not replaced by the new global it infrastructure  for yk compliance 
although the company does not foresee a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  or financial position related to yk issues and the company s it system  risk is not eliminated until the system is fully tested and all non compliant code is identified  corrected  and re verified 
non it systems the company is assessing its non it systems in its plants and facilities on a worldwide basis for issues of yk compliance 
this assessment includes reviewing not only the company s manufacturing process control equipment  but also systems that control temperature  utility equipment  telephone systems  and security systems 
laboratory and test equipment are also being evaluated 
while the company does not believe that it is likely to experience material adverse effects related to yk in the area of non it systems  failure to identify all yk vulnerable controls or equipment  or failure to remediate them in a timely way  could result in the inability of a particular plant or facility to manufacture or test product or conduct business in the ordinary course 
products the majority of company s products do not have electronic date functionality 
those products that do have electronic date functionality have been assessed and remediation strategies have been developed to address any issues of yk non compliance 
the company believes it has sufficient resources dedicated to product compliance activities and it does not foresee any material adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations  or financial position due to yk product issues 
however  there remains the possibility that the company could fail to identify all susceptible products or be unable to implement all field remediations for which it is responsible prior to january  third parties yk preparedness of third parties with whom the company does business could impact the company s ability to deliver products and services in the new millennium 
this constitutes an area of potentially significant risk to the company s business  results of operations  and financial position 
suppliers of critical raw materials and providers of utility and communication services could particularly impair the company s ability to conduct business in the ordinary course if those third parties fail to successfully assess and remediate their own products and internal operations 
while third party risk related to the yk problem is difficult to quantify or control  the company is taking steps in an effort to try to minimize the potential adverse effect of yk problems that could arise based on the company s external business relationships 
yk surveys have been sent to the company s suppliers asking them for the yk compliance status of their products and internal operations 
the company is re contacting the company s most critical suppliers and conducting yk phone surveys with them 
at the present time  the feedback being received from the phone surveys has been favorable 
the company plans to develop third party contingency plans as it identifies critical partners evidencing inadequate yk preparations 
the company s contingency plans may include plans to accumulate extra inventory and or establish alternative sources of supply and channels of distribution 
however  even with diligent planning  third party providers pose an uncertain risk which cannot be entirely eliminated 
expenditures aside from expenditures made by the company in implementing its new corporate it system  the company has not incurred any significant yk related costs to date 
based on current information and resources  the company estimates that it could potentially spend up to million on completing its yk program  excluding costs already anticipated for completion of the company s it system 
this estimated expenditure would most likely occur in the non it systems area 
this estimate is subject to change as the company moves through final phases of its yk plan 
while the company s management does not believe that the company s yk costs will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial position  yk costs could increase if currently unknown yk deficiencies are discovered in company it systems  non it systems  products  or external business partners 
summary due to the uncertain nature of the yk problem  the company s management cannot say with certainty whether yk issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial position 
the company believes it is taking reasonable steps to address the yk problem  but the yk problem is very complex 
if several of the company s external business partners should fail to implement successful yk programs  or if the company should fail to identify yk deficiencies in critical it and non it systems  or if the company s product remediations should fail to be implemented in the field by january   yk problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial position 
the projected expenditures and dates contained in this discussion are based on the company s best estimates and are derived from assumptions about future events  including the availability of resources and other factors 
the company does not guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and results may vary due to uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained in this section under the heading year compliance should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosure below under the heading forward looking statements 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company must adopt this standard no later than january  the company is reviewing the requirements of this standard and has not yet determined the impact of this standard on the financial statements of the company 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software intended for internal use 
the company adopted this standard effective january  the company does not believe that the impact of this standard will be material to the financial statements of the company 
forward looking statements the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements with respect to future goals of the company  including statements contained in this report  the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in the company s reports to shareholders 
the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project  believe or similar expressions identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those presently anticipated or projected 
the company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
among the factors that could cause the company s actual results in the future to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods are the following the company s ability to establish a new brand and identity prior to the distribution  the transferred businesses had the right to use certain m trademarks in marketing their products 
pursuant to agreements entered into with m  the company continues to have the use of certain m trademarks for an agreed upon period of time following the distribution 
the company s right to use certain m trademarks such as the scotch tm trademark expired on june   while the right to use other m trademarks expires on june  the company has made and continues to make significant investments in the development of the company s independent identity and brand 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in this regard or that the loss of use of m trademarks might not have an adverse effect on the business of the company 
competitive industry conditions the company operates in highly competitive environments 
the company s competitors are both larger and smaller than the company in terms of resources and market shares 
the marketplaces in which the company operates are generally characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  a variety of distribution channels  relatively large and aggressive marketing efforts  evolving customer needs away from product purchases and towards increasing integrated business solutions  and declining prices in certain product lines 
driving demand in the data storage industry is a greatly expanding need to manage and store information more rapidly and at lower cost  with greater accuracy and reliability 
similarly  the demand for image management and color management products  services and work flow solutions continues to grow as the use of images and color continues to expand in both commercial and consumer applications 
these offerings are characterized by increasing use of digital technologies  including software and services  replacing analog based products where the company currently has a strong market position in several areas 
in particular  the data storage industry is undergoing rapid technology and market changes  the varieties of data storage media formats available for customers is increasing and the choice of data storage media is not one of the top three strategic decisions made by an it professional or a consumer 
in fact  many customers would prefer not to have to perform data backup  which is the largest application for removable storage media 
data storage media sales account for less than percent of it spending 
the data storage market is characterized by short product development cycles that are driven by rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences as well as declining product prices 
success in introducing and gaining acceptance of new data storage media is dependent on the ability to develop relationships with distributors and oem s 
in these highly competitive markets  the company s success will depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to develop and introduce differentiated and innovative products  services and customer solutions cost effectively and on a timely basis 
the success of the company s offerings is dependent on several factors including competitive technology capabilities  differentiation from competitive offerings  effectiveness of marketing programs and low costs 
although the company believes that it can take the necessary steps to meet the competitive challenges of these marketplaces  no assurance can be given with regard to the company s ability to take these steps  the actions of competitors  some of which will have greater resources than the company  or the pace of technological changes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to introduce new products or maintain competitive technology competencies  that the markets will be receptive to its new products  that the company s marketing programs will be successful  or that the company s competitors will not introduce more advanced products ahead of the company 
in addition  while the company currently has access to significant proprietary technologies through internal development and licensing arrangements with third parties  there can be no assurance that it will continue to have access to new competitive technologies that may be required to introduce new products 
in addition  new technological innovations generally require a substantial investment before any assurance is available as to their commercial viability 
therefore  the company must make strategic decisions from time to time as to the technologies in which the company desires to invest
