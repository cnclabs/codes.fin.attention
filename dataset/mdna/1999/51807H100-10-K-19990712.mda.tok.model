item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for historical information  statements relating to laser vision s plan  objectives and future performance are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on management s current expectations 
because of various risks and uncertainties  actual strategies and results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected 
the discussion set forth below analyzes certain factors and trends related to the financial results for each of the three years ended april   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table breaks out revenue by source 
this table also includes net revenue contribution 
net revenue contribution is revenue less license fees paid to visx and amounts paid to eye surgeons for professional medical services rendered at our fixed laser sites 
management believes that net revenue contribution provides relevant and useful information to investors because it reflects the dollars available to cover laser vision s fixed and variable costs after excluding variable costs which laser vision pays to third parties 
net revenue contribution should not be considered as an alternative to gross profit  operating income and net income as a measure of profitability 
finally  the table includes certain profitability amounts as a percentage of total revenue and net revenue contribution 
fiscal year ended april  in thousands revenue north american refractive    other refractive    cataract  total revenue    royalty fees and professional medical services    revenue less royalty fees and professional medical services  net revenue contribution    gross profit   of total revenue of net revenue contribution income loss from operations    of total revenue of net revenue contribution net income loss before taxes    of total revenue of net revenue contribution rsr revenues for september through april are included in north american refractive revenues 
mss revenues for december through april are shown as cataract revenues 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  laser vision has continued to provide excimer laser access to additional sites throughout the us in addition  the acquisition of rsr on september  has enabled us to provide microkeratome access and the acquisition of mss on december  has allowed us to provide mobile cataract services 
revenue 
total revenue increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  total laser procedures increased by to  for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  the increase in revenue was attributable to a million increase in domestic refractive revenue  a million increase in marketing and training revenue and million in cataract revenue 
the increase in north american revenue was attributable to an increase both in the number of us lasers in operation and the number of procedures performed by our eye surgeon customers on each laser in the us costs of revenue gross profit 
costs of revenue increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this was primarily due to an increase of million in total domestic royalties  an increase of million in mobile laser engineer salaries and travel costs  an increase of million in professional medical services costs  an increase of million in gasses  medical supplies and maintenance  and million of costs related to the cataract business 
the increases in royalty expenses  salaries and travel  professional medical services  and gasses  medical supplies and maintenance are primarily due to increased refractive procedure volume 
total gross profit increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the variable gross profit  excluding depreciation  increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this was primarily due to higher volumes of procedures performed with our equipment at an increased number of sites 
as a percentage of total revenue  total gross profit increased to from for the years ended april  and  respectively 
this improvement is due to performing more procedures per laser  thus improving utilization of our fixed assets 
we do not believe gross profit will continue to improve at this rate 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  new operating expenses related to the cataract business of million along with increases in salaries and related expenses of million were partially offset by decreases in general and administrative expenses of million 
the million increase in salaries and related expenses was attributed to more employees  annual raises and variable compensation based on operating results 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses was attributed to decreased insurance of  and decreased professional fees of  income loss from operations 
the income loss from operations increased by million to million for the year ended april  from a loss of million during the year ended april  this was primarily related to improved domestic refractive profitability and the acquisition of mss in december other income expense 
higher interest expense and minority interest in net income of subsidiary partially offset by higher interest income caused a or  increase to a net  in other expense during the year ended april  from a net  in other expense during the year ended april  this was primarily due to interest expense from the rsr and mss acquisitions 
net income loss 
net income for the year ended april  was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended april  this was primarily attributable to a million increase related to the increased volume of domestic refractive procedures involving our equipment  million from the recognition of income tax benefits in the year ended april  and 
million from mss 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  during the year ended april   we continued to develop the us market by targeting eye surgeons in medium sized markets 
we primarily served these markets with our newly developed roll on roll off mobile system 
revenue 
total revenues increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  total laser procedures increased by to  for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  the increase in revenue was attributable to a million increase in north american refractive revenue and a  decrease in other refractive revenue 
the increase in north american refractive revenue was attributable to an increase both in the number of us lasers in operation and the number of procedures performed by our eye surgeon customers on each laser in the us the decrease in other refractive revenue was attributable to the closing of certain unprofitable fixed sites and the conversion of most of them to mobile sites during the year 
costs of revenue gross profit 
costs of revenue increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this was primarily due to an increase of million in total domestic royalties  an increase of million in mobile laser engineer salaries and travel costs  an increase of  in depreciation expense  and an increase of  in professional medical services costs 
total gross profit increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  the variable gross profit  excluding depreciation  increased by or million to million from million for the year ended april  this was primarily due to higher volumes of procedures performed with our equipment at an increased number of sites 
as a percentage of total revenue  total gross profit increased to from for the years ended april  and  respectively 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by or  to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  decreases for the year ended april  in general and administrative expense of  and selling and marketing expense of  were partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of  and depreciation and amortization expense of  the  increase in salaries and related expenses was attributed to a  domestic increase more employees  annual raises and variable compensation based on operating results  a  canadian decrease primarily due to the closing of a fixed site and a  european decrease primarily due to the closing of two fixed sites 
the  decrease in selling and marketing expenses was attributed to a  domestic decrease primarily because of the conversion from fixed sites to mobile systems  a  canadian decrease due to the closing of a fixed site and a  european decrease due to the closing of two fixed sites 
income loss from operations 
the loss from operations decreased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this was primarily due to the million operating profit earned on the increase in us revenue  a decrease in fixed asset impairment provisions of million  a million reduced operating loss from the canadian operations and a million reduced operating loss from the european operations 
both international operations benefitted from the closing of unprofitable fixed sites 
other income expense 
other income expense increased by or  to a net expense of  for the year ended april  from a net expense of  for the year ended april  this increase was primarily due to an increase of  in interest expense 
inflation laser vision s operations have not been  nor are they expected to be  materially affected by inflation 
liquidity and capital resources laser vision s primary sources of liquidity for the next year are expected to consist of cash generated by operations  vendor financing  proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants  and proceeds from the secondary stock offering completed on may  we believe we could raise additional cash from borrowing or the sale of debt or additional equity securities  if necessary 
we have generated positive cash flow from operations for every quarter since the quarter ended april  we expect that normal ongoing liquidity needs will continue to be covered from the operations of the business 
the million fixed asset impairment provision for the year ended april  was a non cash expense associated with non current assets and did not affect working capital or cash flows 
five summit lasers are leased  and those lease payments will continue until the fall of for two lasers and until the summer of on three other lasers 
the impairment provision during the year ended april  did not affect laser vision s future lease commitments 
laser vision has access to financing on a laser by laser basis for up to of the purchase price of such lasers 
we expect to continue to have access to this financing option for at least the next nine months 
other equipment vendors do not provide equipment financing 
certain employees and directors exercised warrants and options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock in conjunction with the secondary stock offering completed may   yielding proceeds of million to laser vision 
laser vision expects that other option and warrant holders will exercise options and warrants prior to their expiration  but we cannot predict when such exercises will occur 
the net proceeds of the offering totalled approximately million 
together with the cash flow from operations  proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants and laser financing  we believe this will be sufficient to fund our expected cash needs as described below for the forseeable future  exclusive of any acquisitions 
our principal cash needs include normal operating expenses  the purchase of additional equipment  the payments of contingent consideration for rsr and mss  the expansion of patient financing programs and any cash needs for any future acquisitions 
our normal operating expenses include procedure royalty fees  salaries  travel and lodging  medical supplies  equipment maintenance  professional fees  rent and utilities 
we expect to purchase about million of new equipment in fiscal year as noted above  we have available laser financing for up to of the purchase price of excimer lasers 
alternatively  we may choose to pay a larger proportion of the purchase price in cash  and may also choose to accelerate the purchase of our equipment if we believe demand for our services warrants it 
we believe we would be able to obtain third party financing for excimer lasers if we lost access to our current financing source  although we do not know the terms on which such financing may be available 
the rsr acquisition requires an additional million in payments including interest in addition to the  that was paid on february  the mss acquisition required a non contingent payment of million on april  mss met the operating income target for the five month period ending april  accordingly  an additional  has been recorded as goodwill and accrued at april  additional consideration of up to million is contingent upon mss meeting certain operating income targets for the twelve month period ending april   and the three month period ending july  up to of the contingent consideration may be paid in laser vision common stock valued at the market rate  with the balance to be paid in cash 
the amount of contingent consideration paid in common stock is at the sole discretion of laser vision 
laser vision currently offers a program for patient financing  the funds for which are provided primarily by a third party lender 
we guarantee these notes payable to the third party lender 
the amount of such financing currently is million 
if cash generated from our operations is significantly less than anticipated  we have several strategies to deal with it 
first  we can use the maximum amount of financing available for the purchase of new equipment 
second  we can slow down the purchase of new equipment 
third  we can choose the option of funding of the contingent consideration for the mss acquisition with common stock 
fourth  we can delay any potential acquisitions  or attempt to fund such acquisitions with stock or cash raised from third party sources 
finally  laser vision believes it would be able to raise additional money through the borrowing of funds or the sale of debt or additional equity securities 
working capital cash and cash equivalents decreased by or  to million at april  from million at april  at april   working capital had increased by or  to million from million at april  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at april  was to one  compared to to one at april  accounts receivable increased million from april  to april  and million from april  to april  primarily due to increased procedures performed in the us  an increased number of customers being invoiced monthly instead of weekly  and the acquisitions of mss and rsr 
cash flows operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended april  primarily represent the net income in the period plus depreciation and amortization and a net increase in current liabilities  less increases in accounts receivable  inventory  deferred taxes  and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increases in current liabilities  accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets are a result of increased procedure volumes 
the cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended april  primarily represents the net loss incurred in this period less depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts payable and accruals  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for fiscal from a use of million for fiscal the cash flows used by operating activities during fiscal primarily represent the net loss incurred in this period less depreciation  amortization and fixed asset impairment and an increase in accounts payable  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
cash flows investing activities net cash used for investing activities increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  cash used for investing during the year ended april  was primarily used to acquire equipment for the expanding us market and for the acquisitions of mss and rsr 
cash used during the year ended april  was used to acquire equipment 
laser vision expects capital expenditures for equipment to be approximately million in fiscal year net cash used in investing activities decreased by or  to million for fiscal from million in fiscal these changes were primarily due to the acquisition of equipment 
cash flows financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to  during fiscal from cash provided of million during fiscal net cash provided by financing during fiscal was primarily provided by the exercise of stock options and warrants  offset by the repayment of capital lease obligations and notes payable 
net cash provided by financing for fiscal was primarily due to proceeds from a private offering of preferred stock  notes payable and exercise of stock options and warrants offset by the repayment of notes payable and capitalized lease payments 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by or million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was primarily due to proceeds received from notes payable and the exercise of stock options offset by the repayment of certain notes payable and capitalized lease obligations 
the series b convertible preferred stock has a beneficial conversion and mandatory redemption features 
under some circumstances  as defined in the preferred stock agreement  the holders of the series b shares may be able to require us to redeem their shares for cash 
these circumstances include the delisting of the common stock by nasdaq  bankruptcy or change of control of laser vision  and the decline in the price of the common stock to less than approximately per share 
while there can be no assurance that these circumstances will not arise  laser vision believes the likelihood of redemption occurring is remote 
accordingly  the redemption features of the series b shares are not expected to adversely impact our cash flows or liquidity 
income taxes at april   laser vision had approximately million of net operating losses available to be carried forward to offset future domestic and international taxable income and which expire in the years through however  as a result of the history of losses incurred by laser vision  at april  there was insufficient objective evidence of future taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards nol s prior to their expiration 
as a result  a valuation allowance was recorded for substantially all of the estimated million of deferred tax assets which are principally associated with the net operating losses at april   as management believed it was more likely than not that they would not be realized before expiration 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  laser vision s operations became profitable 
for the year ended april   laser vision had pretax income of approximately million 
because of the improving levels of and trend in profitability  management was able for the first time to conclude based on objective evidence that laser vision will likely have taxable income in the next fiscal year 
as a result  a portion of the valuation allowance was reduced and laser vision recognized a million net tax benefit during the three months ended january  and a million tax benefit for the three months ended april   as management believed it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized before expiration 
at april  laser vision had approximately million of net operating losses available to be carried forward 
a valuation allowance was recorded for approximately million of the estimated million deferred tax asset 
management will continue to review and assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
the amount of net tax benefit or expense recognized in the future may fluctuate significantly depending on management s estimates of future taxable income 
if laser vision s profitability continues to improve  additional reductions in the valuation allowance may be recognized 
generally  the benefit arising from the reduction in the valuation allowance is reflected in the statement of operations as a reduction of income tax expense 
however  if an incremental tax benefit is attributed to certain equity transactions that did not impact operating results  such as those arising from the exercise of non qualified stock options and warrants  the tax benefit of the release of the valuation allowance would be reflected directly in stockholders equity 
regardless of when the reduction in the valuation allowance is recognized or whether the tax benefit is recognized in the statement of operations or directly in equity  the utilization of the nol s will substantially reduce laser vision s cash obligations for the payment of any income taxes otherwise due over the next several years 
year year compliance we are aware that some information technology systems may not function properly at the onset of the year these systems record only the last two digits of a date s year instead of the full four digits 
for example  they would record as the year for dates in both and this could cause those systems to process and record information incorrectly or possibly fail to function in the year our services  operations  customers  suppliers and service providers all rely on information technology systems  both hardware and software  to function properly 
this includes readily apparent systems such as those controlling visx excimer lasers used as a key part of our services  as well as less obvious ones such as those required to provide electricity to our main facility 
suppliers we have been surveying existing suppliers about the ability of their systems and products to properly handle dates for the year and beyond 
visx has advised us that its lasers will remain fully functional from a medical standpoint through the year and beyond 
visx has determined that the laser systems do not properly print or store patient report dates and procedures performed in the year or beyond 
visx is in the process of developing and testing a solution to this problem and expects to have it available to us by the middle of the cataract equipment used by mss and the microkeratome equipment used for lasik procedures are not affected by the year situation and will remain fully functional from a medical viewpoint according to the cataract and microkeratome equipment manufacturers 
if our other suppliers do not reply or cannot provide year compliant products  we may need to locate alternative sources for goods and services 
operations we have been gathering information from vendors about year compliance for each of the major elements of our internal information technology systems 
based on the statements from vendors  we understand the following our operating systems  which include ms windows nt  ms windows  ms windows and novell intranetware  are all year compliant in their latest versions 
we will need to run a service pack for our novell intranetware system to bring it up to the current version 
we expect to complete this by the third quarter of calendar our key applications include ms exchange server  solomon financial software for windows  ms office and microbilt credit commander 
ms exchange server  ms office and microbilt credit commander are year compliant 
solomon financial software for windows will be year compliant after running a service pack for the application to bring it up to the current version of software 
we expect to complete this during the second and third quarters of calendar our mitel sx telephone system is year compliant 
our colorado replay plus active voice voicemail system is not year compliant 
we expect to replace this system by the third quarter of calendar our computer hardware  which is all pc based  is year compliant with the exception of a few older personal computers 
the hardware used to control our local area network is year compliant 
we expect to install any necessary upgrades or replace any computers that are not year compliant during the second and third quarters of calendar we have received notification from the owners and managers of our facility that it is year compliant with regard to building security  heating  and lighting controls 
costs to address year issues we expect that any remaining costs for year compliance will be less than  and that the majority of these disbursements will be for equipment purchases and therefore will be capitalized and depreciated 
the total anticipated costs for year compliance past and future is expected to be less than  however  we may spend more money than we have estimated  and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
at this stage in the assessment process  we do not believe that the year issue will materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
there can be no assurance that operating problems or expenses related to the year issue will not arise with our computer systems and software or that our customers or suppliers will be able to resolve their year issues in a timely manner 
accordingly  we plan to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
contingency plans the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would be that a solution to the visx laser printing and storing of patient report dates for procedures performed in the year and beyond is not corrected in a timely manner 
to the extent that any computer documentation of procedures is unavailable  we are prepared to manually produce the necessary reports 
as we complete our internal review and external surveys we will prepare additional contingency plans to prepare for the problems that we believe are reasonably likely to arise 
however  despite our best efforts  we may not anticipate all problems that may ultimately arise 
risks of year issues we will continue preparations with the goal of ensuring that the information technology relating to our services  operations and suppliers will recognize dates and function properly in the year and beyond 
however  unanticipated problems could affect our ability to provide services to our customers or interrupt or prevent deliveries from suppliers at the onset of the year as a result  we could suffer a material adverse impact to our business  financial position and results of operation due to a loss of revenue  legal claims or extra expenses caused by unanticipated year computer problems 
new accounting standard laser vision adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas in the fiscal year ended april  sfas established standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to stockholders 
sfas also establishes standards for related disclosures for products and services and geographic areas 
operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in making decisions how to allocate resources and assess performance 
market risk in the ordinary course of business  laser vision is exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risks  which we do not currently consider to be material 
these exposures primarily relate to having investments denominated in foreign currencies and to having fixed rate debt
