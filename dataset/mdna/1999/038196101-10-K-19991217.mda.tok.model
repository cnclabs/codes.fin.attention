item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company is the largest producer of opp films in north america 
consumer product companies worldwide use our opp films in labeling  packaging and overwrap applications that often require special attributes such as high gloss  vivid graphics  exceptional clarity and barriers to air  light and moisture to preserve freshness 
the company generally sells its film products to converters  which are companies specializing in processes such as laminating multiple films or other materials together and printing text and graphics to form the final label or packaging material for end users 
for the purposes of the discussion that follows  the fiscal years ended september   and are referred to as  and  respectively 
all dollar amounts are in thousands 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of the company s sales represented by certain income and expense items in its income statements years ended september sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating profit loss interest expense  net net income loss fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales for fiscal of  were  or percent lower than fiscal sales of  due to the divestiture of certain non core businesses in the third quarter of adjusted for these divestitures  sales increased in fiscal by  or percent  as compared with fiscal  as a result of opp films unit volume growth of percent  offset in part by significantly lower average selling prices compared with due to industry overcapacity 
demand for opp films continues to grow  while industry overcapacity is expected to exist for about one more year 
approximately percent of sales were from new or enhanced products introduced by the company within the past four years 
sales outside the united sates comprised percent of total sales  and operating profit for sales outside the united states was percent of total operating profit 
gross profit for was  or percent of sales  exclusive of  in plant shutdown costs 
gross profit increased  or percent from the level of  or percent of sales  adjusted for the aforementioned divestitures 
despite a dramatic decline in selling prices due to industry overcapacity  we achieved an increase in gross margin due to extensive productivity improvement programs and continuing improvement in sales mix brought about by the effectiveness of our r d and sales efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for from  in  an increase of  reflecting the company s investment in expanded sales reach and the infrastructure necessary to handle over percent more capacity 
during the first fiscal quarter of  the company terminated acquisition discussions with two of the largest european based worldwide opp films producers 
we were unable to reach a mutually agreeable price at which the company would acquire either of these businesses  given the deterioration in the european opp films market caused by the major industry wide overcapacity in that region 
costs associated with both of these acquisition projects and related due diligence efforts were  or  after taxes  and were recorded as non operating expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced a restructuring of its covington  virginia manufacturing operation  including the shutdown of two older  less efficient production lines and the elimination of approximately full time manufacturing and plant administrative positions  of which were hourly and the remainder of which were salaried 
the company recorded an  charge in the fourth quarter of for this restructuring  comprised of approximately  for costs associated with operating leases related to idled equipment   of severance related costs and  in other charges  primarily related to idling the equipment 
implementation of this plan is nearing completion  with a total of positions eliminated and the shutdown of the production lines 
since september the company has paid out on leases related to idled equipment   in severance related costs and  in other restructuring costs  resulting in an accrued restructuring balance of  at september  of this balance   represents lease costs  the majority of which are classified as long term liabilities 
all aspects of the plan are expected to be completed early in fiscal net interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily as a result of interest capitalized in associated with a capacity expansion project which was completed in march income tax as a percentage of before tax income or loss remained constant for and fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales for fiscal of  were  or percent lower than fiscal sales of  this decrease was due to the divestiture of certain non core businesses and lower average selling prices for opp films  offset in part by increased sales volume of opp films 
in the fourth quarter of  aet divested its injection molding and adhesive nets businesses  and in the third quarter of it divested its industrial extrusion and remaining plastic netting businesses 
the lower average selling prices for opp films were attributable to highly competitive market conditions resulting from excess industry production capacity and characterized by substantial declines in selling prices  particularly of lower end commodity products 
aet s average selling prices were impacted by these price reductions as the proportion of lower end products in its sales mix increased in connection with the start up of the company s ten meter production line 
although average selling prices declined in  unit volume sales of opp films increased by percent due principally to the successful ramp up since march of the ten meter wide production line 
the sales volume increase was facilitated by this new capacity as well as investments made in recent years in new product development and an expanded sales and marketing organization 
approximately percent of sales were from new or enhanced products introduced by the company within the past three years 
sales outside the united sates comprised percent of total sales  and operating profit for sales outside the united states was percent of total operating profit 
gross profit was  for  a decrease of  or percent from the level of  as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased to percent in versus percent in this decrease was due to the previously discussed lower average selling prices throughout the opp films industry during  and the company s sales mix  offset in part by lower production costs resulting from new highly efficient assets and lower raw material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  for from  in  a decrease of research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of in previous years  as part of aet s initiatives to enhance product offerings and expand the reach of the sales and marketing organization  spending in the selling  marketing and research and development areas was increased 
in spending in these areas leveled off 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company elected early adoption of the accounting standards executive committee statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
the effect of this change in accounting was the recognition of  of expenses related to net start up costs incurred during fiscal  and a one time charge of  net of related income tax benefits of  resulting from costs incurred in prior periods 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  aet began implementing a shutdown of certain older and less efficient assets in its covington  virginia facility and made certain other organizational changes  including a percent reduction in total headcount 
in connection with the shutdown  the company recorded a charge of  or  after taxes 
aet also wrote down the value of certain other assets in its covington  virginia facility  whose carrying values had been impaired by an aggregate of  net interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of  or percent 
this decrease was due to lower levels of outstanding debt during compared to income tax benefit of  represents the impact of losses resulting from restructuring and impairment charges and the write off of start up costs in versus pre tax earnings in income tax as a percentage of before tax income or loss remained constant for and liquidity and capital resources aet maintains a credit agreement with a group of lenders to provide bank financing 
this credit agreement  as amended and restated  is a  revolving credit facility the credit facility with a final maturity on the earlier of i november   if the aet senior notes are not refinanced prior to such date  or ii january  the credit facility is secured by all the assets of aet 
it includes covenants which limit borrowings based on certain asset levels  require aet to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and specified interest coverage and leverage ratios  restrict payment of cash dividends to stockholders  and establish maximum capital expenditure levels 
it also contains other covenants customary in transactions of this type 
at september   aet had approximately  available under its revolving credit facility 
the company also has  of revenue bonds outstanding  which are due november  operating activities in provided  in cash  which was the result of  of net income before depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenditures  plus a  net increase in other working capital items  after giving effect to divestitures 
the net increase in working capital resulted from a  decrease in inventory  a decrease in accounts receivable  a  increase in prepaid and other charges  and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  interest paid during amounted to  including capitalized interest 
additions to property  plant and equipment were  and were funded in part by borrowings pursuant to the credit facility  with the balance funded by available cash flow 
in april  the company acquired certain assets of aep industries inc s opp films business 
the net purchase price of approximately  in cash was funded with a portion of the proceeds of a sale leaseback transaction involving other assets of the company 
this sale leaseback transaction yielded net proceeds to the company of approximately  the proceeds of the sale leaseback transaction  completed in april  in excess of the purchase price for the aep assets  were utilized to pay down outstanding borrowings under the company s existing credit facility 
aet believes that available cash and equivalents  cash flow from the business  and borrowing availability under the credit agreement will provide adequate funds over the next months to accommodate its working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service obligation 
year aet s company wide year project  which is addressing the issue of computer programs and embedded computer chips being unable to distinguish between the year and the year has been completed 
the project was comprised of five major phases taking inventory of systems potentially impacted by the year issue  assessing the year compliance or capability of systems determined to be material to the company  repairing or replacing material systems that are determined not to be year compliant or capable  testing the repaired or replaced systems  and designing and implementing contingency and business continuation plans 
the largest part of the project was the implementation of a new enterprise wide information system which commenced in the financial  sales  order entry  electronic data interchange and administrative portions of the implementation were completed over the past several years 
the inventory  shop floor and related manufacturing portions of the system were implemented on september  the total cost associated with year compliance activities has been approximately  of which  has been spent on the purchase and implementation of new enterprise wide systems which offer many other enhancements in comparison to the previous systems 
all costs to complete the project have been paid 
no critical information technology projects have been deferred due to our year compliance efforts 
the failure of the company or one of its key customers or suppliers to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
a worst case scenario would be the inability of the local electric utilities to supply power to aet s manufacturing plants  particularly at our largest plant in terre haute  indiana 
under this scenario  a loss of electricity would result in a shutdown of our manufacturing equipment 
due to the amount of electricity needed to operate the equipment  it is not feasible to utilize most alternative sources of electricity 
therefore aet would be unable to manufacture products for customers  and thus aet s operations could be materially impacted 
while our customers are reliant on a steady supply of our opp films in general  the company does not have guaranteed supply agreements with its customers 
the company s contingency planning process for year problems is ongoing 
contingency plans include arrangements for alternate suppliers when available  re running certain processes if errors occur  using manual intervention to ensure the continuation of operations where possible  and scheduling activity in december that would normally occur at the beginning of january if it becomes necessary for the company to take corrective actions  it is uncertain whether this would result in significant delays in business operations or have material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
aet believes that the completion of the year project as scheduled should substantially reduce the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations 
inflation management reviews the prices charged for its products on a regular basis 
when market conditions allow  adjustments are made to reflect changes in demand or product costs due to fluctuations in the cost of materials  labor and inflation 
the costs of raw materials make up a significant portion of aet s costs and have historically fluctuated 
there can be no assurance  however  that future market conditions will support any correlation between raw material cost fluctuations and finished product films pricing 
seasonal nature of certain opp markets certain of the end use markets for the company s opp films are seasonal 
for example  demand in the snack food  soft drink and candy markets is generally higher in the spring and summer 
as a result  sales and net income are generally higher in those periods 
new accounting pronouncements information related to new accounting pronouncements is included in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those risks related to the timely development and acceptance of new products  fluctuations in raw materials and other production costs  the loss of one or more significant customers  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the timely completion of capital projects  the success of the company s efforts to access capital markets on satisfactory terms  and to acquire  integrate and operate new businesses and expand into new markets  as well as other risks detailed in exhibit of the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  and from time to time in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission
