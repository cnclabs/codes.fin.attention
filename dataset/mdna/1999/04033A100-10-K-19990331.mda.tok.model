item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this prospectus  the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to ariad are included to identify forward looking statements 
the company s actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements appearing elsewhere herein 
overview the company focuses on the discovery and development of novel and proprietary drugs based on its understanding of the inner workings of cells and the genes involved in disease 
the company has developed a product based on its gene regulation technology to treat graft versus host disease  a complication of bone marrow transplantation involving an attack by a patient s immune system on healthy tissue 
this product entered phase human clinical trials in december all of the company s other drug candidates are in the pre clinical stage 
ariad s research and development programs involve three areas signal transduction inhibitors  regulated gene therapy and functional genomics 
signal transduction inhibitors are drugs designed to block specific molecular targets in bone cells and white blood cells 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with hoechst marion roussel  inc hmr to collaborate on the discovery and development of such drugs to treat osteoporosis and other bone diseases 
the company also has developed a system referred to as ariad regulated gene expression technology or argent which is designed to control cellular activities using small molecule drugs 
this system can be applied in research for discovery of new drugs and new genes  in gene and cell therapy  and in the manufacture of biological products 
the leading application of this system is the controlled production of protein drugs by regulated gene therapy 
another use of this system is ariad s product to treat graft versus host disease 
this product may improve the safety and effectiveness of certain types of bone marrow transplants by selectively killing the cells responsible for graft versus host disease 
in addition  the company is working in an area known as functional genomics  which involves the discovery of new genes and the validation of molecular targets that may be useful in the treatment of diseases 
ariad is developing this information as a tool to accelerate the discovery of new drugs to treat these diseases  such as osteoporosis bones  atherosclerosis heart and blood vessels and cancer 
in march  the company established a joint venture with hmr  named the hoechst ariad genomics center  llc the genomics center  to pursue this area 
since its inception in  the company has devoted substantially all of its resources to its research and development programs 
the company receives no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products and substantially all revenue to date has been received in connection with the company s research collaborations 
the company has not been profitable since inception and expects to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to the expansion of its research and development programs  including the services the company provides to the genomics center pursuant to certain research and administrative services agreements the services agreements  which services are accounted for on a cost reimbursement basis 
the company expects that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  results of operations years ended december   and revenue the company recognized research revenue under the services agreements  collaborative research arrangements and government sponsored grants of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of  or in compared to was due to an increase of  in research revenue recognized under the services agreements with the genomics center offset by a  decrease in research revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement and government sponsored research grants 
the decrease in research revenue of  or in compared to was due to a  decrease in research revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement and government sponsored research grants offset by an increase of  in research revenue recognized under the services agreements with the genomics center 
research revenue for recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement included  for the achievement of the first research milestone 
research revenue resulting from the services agreements with the genomics center is expected to increase over the next two years and research revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement is expected to increase in compared to primarily due to the achievement of the second research milestone of  which was received on february  see liquidity and capital resources 
interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income decreased by  in compared to as a result of a lower level of funds invested 
interest income increased by  in compared to as a result of higher levels of funds invested offset somewhat by lower yields 
operating expenses research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased by  or in compared to and  or in compared to primarily due to the expected increases in research services provided to the genomics center under the services agreements and increased drug development costs for the regulated gene expression technology argent tm  including manufacturing  process development and other preclinical development activities in preparation for clinical trials of ap which commenced in december ap is an argent tm inducible apoptosis product to treat graft versus host disease in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation 
the company expects its research and development expenses to increase over the next two years as a result of increased research services to be provided to the genomics center as well as increased manufacturing and preclinical development costs associated with its drug candidates and the cost of human clinical trials of ap general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or in compared to primarily due to the nonrecurrence in of administrative expenses incurred in connection with the formation of the genomics center in general and administrative expenses increased by  or in compared to primarily due to increased expenses incurred with the formation of and services provided to the genomics center and other administrative expenses 
the company incurred interest expense of  in compared to  in and  in the increase of  in compared to was due to the issuance of debt at the end of the second quarter of and the increase of  in compared to was due to a higher level of long term debt 
operating results the company incurred net losses of  in   in and  in the company expects that substantial operating losses will continue for several more years and will increase as a result of services provided to the genomics center and as the company s drug candidates in research  if successfully developed  undergo preclinical studies and clinical trials 
operating losses are likely to fluctuate as a result of differences in the timing and composition of revenue earned and expenses incurred 
preferred dividends of  were recognized in the fourth quarter of which are attributable to the  of series c convertible preferred stock series c preferred stock issued on november  the series c preferred stock carries a annual dividend resulting in net losses attributable to common stockholders of  in   in and  in  or  
and 
per share  respectively 
at december   the company had available for federal tax reporting purposes net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  that expire commencing in the company also had federal research and development tax credit carryovers of approximately  that expire commencing in the utilization of both the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits is subject to certain limitations under federal tax laws 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations and investments primarily through the private placement and public offering of its securities  including the sale of series c preferred stock to investors  the sale of series b convertible preferred stock series b preferred stock to hmr  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt  operating and capital lease transactions  interest income  government sponsored research grants  research revenue under the hmr osteoporosis agreement and  commencing in april  research revenue under the terms of the services agreements with the genomics center 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  and working capital of  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  and working capital of  at december  the primary uses of cash during the year ended december  were  to finance the company s operations and working capital requirements   to purchase laboratory equipment   to repay long term debt   for net investment in the genomics center and  to acquire intellectual property 
the primary sources of funds during the year ended december  were  from the private placement of series c preferred stock   from the private placement of common stock and  from the sale leaseback of laboratory equipment 
on may   the company completed a private placement of  shares of common stock to a group of institutional investors at a price of per share and received net proceeds of approximately  after deducting selling commissions and offering expenses 
the shares were registered for resale under the securities act of  as amended 
on november   the company completed a private placement of  shares of series c preferred stock to a group of institutional investors and received proceeds of  the underlying common shares were registered for resale under the securities act of  as amended 
in march  the company entered into a joint venture with hmr to pursue functional genomics with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic proteins and small molecule drug targets 
the company and hmr agreed to commit  to the establishment of the genomics center and its first five years of operations 
the company and hmr committed to jointly fund  of operating and related costs  and ariad committed to invest up to  in leasehold improvements and equipment for use by ariad in conducting research on behalf of the genomics center 
through december   the company had invested  in leasehold improvements and equipment and funded  in operating and related costs 
hmr has committed to provide ariad with capital adequate to fund ariad s share of such costs through the purchase of up to  of series b preferred stock through the five year period  including an initial investment of  as discussed below 
the company also entered into the services agreements with the genomics center to provide research and administrative services to the genomics center on a cost reimbursement basis 
pursuant to the hmr genomics agreement  on march   hmr purchased  shares of the company s series b preferred stock for  during the period from to  at the company s option  hmr has agreed to make subsequent purchases of up to  of series b preferred stock at purchase prices based on a premium to the market price of the common stock at the time of each subsequent purchase  unless the market price of the common stock exceeds a predetermined ceiling  in which case the purchase price will be equal to the market price the series b price 
on january   hmr purchased  shares of series b preferred stock for  representing the amount of the subsequent purchase available to ariad for under the agreement 
subsequent commitments by hmr to purchase series b preferred stock are  and  for each of the years ended december  and and  for the three months ended march  should ariad and hmr determine that the genomics center require funds in excess of those committed  ariad may fund its share of the excess through a loan facility made available by hmr 
funds borrowed by ariad pursuant to such loan facility  if any  will bear interest at a rate of libor plus and are repayable by june  in cash or series b preferred stock  at the series b price  at the company s option 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with hmr to collaborate on the discovery and development of drugs to treat osteoporosis and related bone diseases  one of the company s signal transduction inhibitor programs 
under the terms of the hmr osteoporosis agreement  hmr made an initial cash payment to the company of  agreed to provide research funding in equal quarterly amounts of  up to an aggregate of  over a five year period and agreed to provide an aggregate of up to  upon the attainment of certain research milestones  including the second milestone of  which was received on february  in addition  hmr has established a dedicated research group to collaborate with the company on the discovery of osteoporosis drugs and has agreed to fund all of the preclinical and clinical development costs for products that emerge from the collaboration 
the hmr osteoporosis agreement further provides for the payment of royalties to the company based on product sales 
to date  revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement has amounted to  the company has substantial fixed commitments under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt instruments 
such fixed commitments currently aggregate in excess of  per year and may increase 
the company will require substantial additional funding for its research and product development programs  including preclinical development and clinical trials  for operating expenses  for the pursuit of regulatory clearances and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether obtained through financial markets or collaborative or other arrangements with collaborative partners  or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  plus interest income and planned research and development funding and other sources of funding  including anticipated strategic alliances  will be adequate to satisfy its capital and operating requirements through however  there can be no assurance that changes in the company s research and development plans or other events affecting the company s revenues or operating expenses will not result in the earlier depletion of the company s funds 
impact of the year issue the year issue relates to a complex of potential problems arising from the ways in which computer software can handle dates 
many older systems use a two digit date format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
some of the company s computer programs or other information systems that have time sensitive software or embedded microcontrollers may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the company s plan to address year issues consists of three phases assessment  testing and implementation 
the company is in the process of completing an initial assessment of its information technology infrastructure  hardware and software which began in based on this review  the company believes that the costs and or consequences associated with the year issue are not expected to have a material effect on its business  operations or financial condition 
a second  more in depth analysis is also currently ongoing 
internally  this review will include the testing of systems developed by the company 
although the internal portion of this analysis just recently commenced  the company believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software and systems  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer and other information systems 
if required  the company will utilize additional internal and external resources to reprogram  replace  and test the software and systems for year modifications 
externally  the company s preparations for the year issue will consist of soliciting and  where feasible  obtaining certification of year compliance from third party software vendors and determining the readiness of its significant suppliers 
the company is working with external suppliers and service providers to ensure that they and their systems will be able to support our needs and  where necessary  interact with our server and hardware and software infrastructure in preparation for the year this testing phase is expected to be completed by september  if any necessary modifications  conversions and or replacements are not made  are not completed timely  or if any of the company s suppliers or customers do not successfully deal with the year issue  such circumstances could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s research and development efforts  which rely heavily on the storage and retrieval of electronic information  could be interrupted resulting in significant delays in any one or all of the company s research and development programs 
the severity of these possible problems would depend on the nature of the problem and how quickly it could be corrected or an alternative implemented  which is unknown at this time 
in the extreme  such problems could disrupt a significant portion of the company s operation 
while management has not yet specifically determined the costs associated with its year readiness efforts  monitoring and managing the year issue will result in additional direct and indirect costs to the company 
direct costs include potential charges by third party software vendors for product enhancements  costs involved in testing software products for year compliance and any resulting costs for developing and implementing contingency plans for critical software products which are not enhanced 
the company estimates the total cost for upgrading its computer system  hardware and software is not likely to exceed  indirect costs will principally consist of the time devoted by existing employees in monitoring software vendor progress  testing enhanced software products and implementing any necessary contingency plans 
such costs have not been material to date 
both direct and indirect costs of addressing the year issue will be charged to earnings as incurred 
at the present time  a contingency plan has not been developed 
after evaluating its internal compliance efforts as well as the compliance of third parties as described above  the company expects to have contingency plans in place by november  to address situations in which various systems of the company  or of third parties with which the company does business  are not year compliant 
some risks of the year issue  however  are beyond the control of the company and its suppliers and customers 
for example  no preparations or contingency plan will protect the company from a downturn in economic activity caused by the possible ripple effect throughout the entire economy caused by the year issue 
new accounting pronouncements in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting on the cost of start up activities  which will require that all organizational costs be expensed as incurred 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt this sop effective january  and will expense  in the first quarter of  as a cumulative effect accounting change 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
management is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company will adopt this accounting standard on january   as required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company maintains an investment portfolio in accordance with its investment policy 
the primary objectives of the company s investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
the company s investment policy specifies credit quality standards for the company s investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the company s marketable securities consist of corporate debt and us government securities primarily with maturities of one year or less  but generally less than six months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
these investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonable possible near term changes in the interest rates on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material due to the short term nature of these investments 
at december   the company has a bank term note at prime plus and a government sponsored term note at prime plus 
these notes are sensitive to interest rate risk 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the prime rate  the company would incur approximately  of additional interest expense per year
