item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains trend analysis and might contain forward looking statements 
these statements are based on current expectations and actual results might differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to vary are those described in this overview section and in business certain considerations 
overview the company s revenues are derived from providing hospitals and surgery centers with reusable gowns  towels  drapes  and basins for use in surgical procedures through a daily comprehensive surgical procedure based delivery and retrieval system  and also from the sale of disposable surgical products that supplement its reusable surgical product service 
the company s revenue growth is primarily affected by the number of customers  the number and type of surgical procedures it services for each customer  and the pricing by type of surgical pack 
as of december   the company believes its facilities operated at approximately of their estimated aggregate annual revenue capacity of approximately million at current prices 
estimated annual revenue capacity is based on the company s estimate of revenues that would be derived from the full utilization of the facilities at current prices and without addition of equipment 
variations in maximum revenue potential by facility result from differences in product mix and pricing for each facility 
the company s ability to use this excess revenue capacity will depend on its success in substantially increasing its volume of business 
a primary strategy of the company is to increase its operating leverage by expanding revenues within existing markets 
the company amortizes its reusable surgical products on a per use basis  based on estimates of the products useful lives 
sri s purchase of used reusable surgical products in the acquisition at approximately of amsco sterile s net book value has resulted in lower amortization expense since the acquisition 
since the acquisition  the company s purchases of new reusable surgical products at current replacement cost have gradually increased its amortization expense and the company expects this trend to continue in the future 
however  the company s current replacement cost is substantially less than amsco sterile s original cost due to significantly improved sourcing of fabrics

in the twelve months ended december   repak had annual revenues of approximately million from its reusable surgical products reprocessing service 
the company also purchased the repak facility s real estate for million cash from affiliates of standard textile 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements

see business certain considerations need for capital 
year compliance the company has developed and is implementing a comprehensive program to address year issues pertaining to both information technology and non information technology systems 
the program consists of identification  compliance  and post implementation phases  and considers the effect of the year on the company s internal systems  customers  products and services  as well as on its suppliers and other critical business partners 
the company is currently implementing enterprise wide software that is year compliant which will replace the existing financial and operational systems 
in conjunction with the software project  the company has and will incur internal staff costs  consulting and other expenses for infrastructure and facilities enhancements to prepare its computer systems and applications for this implementation 
the company does not expect year related expense to materially impact its financial position

the company expects completion of its internal year programs by the end of the third quarter of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition  the company has initiated communications  which include solicitation of written responses to questionnaires and follow up meetings  with critical suppliers and other business partners to determine the extent to which any year issues affecting such third parties will affect the company 
there can be no guarantee that such external parties will achieve year compliance on a timely basis  and failure by such significant external parties to achieve compliance could have a material adverse affect on the company 
the company has not yet obtained information sufficient to quantify the potential effects of possible internal and external year non compliance  to determine the likely worst case scenarios or to develop contingency plans to deal with such scenarios 
however  as the company completes its year project during the third quarter of  the appropriate contingency plans will be developed  and implementation will begin if deemed necessary by the company 
there can be no assurances that the company s internal and external contingency plans  once developed  will substantially reduce the risk of year non compliance 
a significant interruption in the company s business due to a year non compliance issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  operations and liquidity
