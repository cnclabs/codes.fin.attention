item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company has engaged in acquisition and divestiture transactions which may affect the comparison of results between periods 
all per share amounts reflect the impact of the december   three for two common stock split as discussed in note d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on february   sempra energy sempra  an energy services holding company based in san diego  california and the company announced that their respective boards of directors had approved a definitive agreement under which sempra and the company would combine in a stock and cash transaction 
this merger is conditioned  among other things  upon the approvals of shareholders of both companies as well as certain regulatory approvals  including approvals of the federal energy regulatory commission and clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of for additional information  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
consolidated financial results dollars in millions except per share amounts operating revenues    gross margin operating income net income diluted earnings per share return on average common equity the company s results for reflect increases from of percent in operating revenues  percent in gross margin and percent in operating income 
these increases are due  in large part  to the inclusion of the results of operations of midcon corp 
midcon beginning with its january   acquisition date 
the operating revenues  gross margin and operating income associated with each of the company s business segments were negatively affected during by i low natural gas liquids ngls prices and associated reduced processing margins and ii reduced pipeline basis differentials reflecting  in part  weather related reduction in demand as further described within the individual segment discussions which follow 
in addition  the results of operations for include i million of pre tax expense million after tax or per diluted share associated with the january   acquisition of midcon by k n and ii the negative impact of items totaling approximately million before tax million after tax or per diluted share 
the pre tax loss associated with these items includes i million attributable to settlement of the arbitration of certain environmental litigation as a result of which the company will have no future expense associated with this matter  ii a loss of million resulting from the sale of several under performing natural gas processing facilities  iii write downs totaling approximately million due to the revaluation of certain natural gas due from third parties and in underground storage and ngls inventories to reflect current market values  iv million in increased allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and v million of increased provisions for regulatory refund obligations 
these charges were partially offset by the million pre tax million after tax or per diluted share gain from the sale of the company s kansas distribution properties and the million pre tax million after tax or per diluted share gain from the sale of certain microwave towers 
there was a significant increase in interest expense in and an increase in the effective tax rate  see other income and deductions and income taxes elsewhere herein 
earnings per diluted share for declined by percent from reflecting  in addition to the decline in net income  an increase of percent in average shares outstanding  largely due to the march common stock issuance associated with the acquisition of midcon see notes d and d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations reflecting the company s strategy of extracting margins from the various segments of the energy value stream  the company has segregated its results of operations into upstream  midstream and downstream components 
the company s upstream operations consist of i natural gas gathering  ii natural gas processing and iii ngls extraction and marketing activities 
midstream operations consist of transportation  storage and bundled sales transactions for k n s interstate and intrastate pipelines 
downstream activities principally consist of energy marketing  regulated natural gas distribution and electric power generation and sales 
for comparative purposes  the company s previously reported segment results have been restated to conform to the current presentation 
the following segment data are before intersegment eliminations 
upstream gathering and processing dollars in millions except per gallon amounts operating revenues gas sales natural gas liquids sales gathering  transportation and other operating costs and expenses gas purchases and other costs of sales operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes  other than income taxes operating loss income systems throughput trillion btus gas sales gathering and transportation natural gas liquids sales million gallons average sales price gallon operating revenues and operating expenses for upstream increased by million and million  respectively  from to due primarily to the effect of a full year of the results of operations of the bushton processing facility 
upstream operating income decreased from income of million in to a loss of million in this net decrease of million included million of positive contribution from the operating results of assets which were not included in operating results  including assets acquired with the midcon  red cedar gathering company and interenergy corporation acquisitions 
this positive impact was more than offset by approximately million of negative variance associated with assets owned and operated during both periods 
approximately percent of this negative variance was attributable to decreased ngls prices during the addition of the bushton facility in april was accretive to earnings 
however  due in part to its contract mix  this acquisition increased upstream s sensitivity to ngls prices and to the spread between ngls prices and natural gas prices 
the remaining negative variance was principally due to the impacts of i increased downtime resulting from plant turnaround and installation of additional measurement facilities  ii operational problems in associated with deficient vendor performance  iii reduced pipeline basis differentials which negatively affected joint venture marketing activities  iv ngls storage inventory write downs and v reduced revenues from the sale of ngls marketing rights and processing agreements 
the significant increases in operating revenues  costs and expenses and volumetric data over largely reflect the acquisition of the bushton gathering and processing assets effective april  increased operating income from the bushton assets was partially offset by lower ngls prices received at other processing facilities 
midstream sales  transportation and storage dollars in millions operating revenues transportation and storage gas sales other operating costs and expenses gas purchases and other costs of sales operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes  other than income taxes operating income systems throughput trillion btus  midstream operating income increased from million in to million in this increase in operating income  as well as the significant increases in operating revenues  operating expenses and throughput shown in the preceding table  was principally attributable to the inclusion in of the operating results of i the interstate and intrastate pipeline operations of assets acquired with midcon see note d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and ii the pony express pipeline  which began full operation in the fourth quarter of there was no significant variance attributable to the operating results of assets owned in both periods 
the pony express pipeline accounted for the majority of the improvement in midstream operating income from to additionally  operating results were positively affected by increased gas supply requirements for the company s retail natural gas services and other wholesale customers 
these gas supply requirements increased in principally due to colder weather and higher irrigation demand in the northern portions of the company s operating area 
these positive impacts were partially offset by reduced wholesale irrigation demand in the texas intrastate market area and the transfer of the casper processing plant to the upstream segment in august downstream retail and marketing dollars in millions operating revenues gas sales    transportation and other operating costs and expenses gas purchases and other costs of sales    operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes  other than income taxes operating income gas sales trillion btus  downstream operating income decreased from million in to million in primarily due to a decrease in earnings from commodity marketing and other factors as described following 
operating income for included million of income from certain new assets and businesses not included in  including k n power  the thermo companies thermo  k n telecommunications and the company s interest in the hermosillo  mexico  natural gas distribution system 
additionally  results  as compared to  were positively affected by the fact that results included approximately million of power marketing losses the company is not currently engaged in power marketing 
however  these favorable variances were more than offset by i a million decrease attributable to equity in losses of en able and ii a decrease of million in operating income from commodity marketing  which reflected million of adjustments to write down certain natural gas due from third parties and in underground storage to their current market values  million of increased provision for uncollectible accounts receivable  reduced sales of gas in storage and depressed basis differentials and milder weather which have a negative impact on certain sales margins due to the costs associated with transportation commitments 
downstream results were positively affected in  relative to  by increased sales of gas in storage  sales of certain non strategic gas supply and increases in space heating and irrigation loads in the northern portions of the company s operating area 
these positive impacts were more than offset by i million of power marketing losses  ii reduced wholesale irrigation demand in the texas intrastate markets and iii expenses incurred during to centralize the company s marketing activities in houston  texas 
other income and deductions in millions interest expense  net minority interests other  net the increase of million in interest expense  net from to was principally due to incremental debt associated with the midcon acquisition and construction costs associated with the pony express pipeline 
the increase in net expense associated with minority interests in  relative to  was principally due to the dividend requirements associated with the million of capital trust securities issued in april the million decrease in other  net from to reflects the fact that included i a million gain from the sale of certain microwave towers  ii an million gain from the sale of the company s kansas natural gas distribution properties  iii the recognition of million in costs related to the settlement of the arbitration of certain environmental claims  as a result of which the company will have no future expense associated with this matter  iv approximately million of expense reflecting an increased provision for regulatory refund obligations  v a loss of approximately million from the sale of certain natural gas processing facilities and vi million of other miscellaneous income items  while included approximately million of income related to the sale of a percent interest in en able  million of gains from the sale of non strategic gathering systems  million of equity financing costs associated with the pony express pipeline and million of other miscellaneous income items 
the increase in interest expense  net in  relative to  was the result of additional long term debt issued in and higher levels of short term debt  principally to fund capital expenditures 
the increase in net expenses associated with minority interests in was primarily due to the dividend requirements associated with the million of capital trust securities issued in april the change in other  net from to was principally due to the items recorded in as described preceding 
income taxes dollars in millions provision effective tax rate the million net increase in income tax expense from to reflected a decrease of approximately million attributable to a decrease in pre tax income and an increase of approximately million attributable to an increase in the effective tax rate 
this increased effective tax rate was principally due to i certain adjustments as described following and ii an increase in the effective state tax rate attributable to the addition of the results of operations of midcon 
the million net decrease in income tax expense from to reflected an increase of approximately million attributable to an increase in pre tax income and a decrease of approximately million attributable to a decrease in the effective tax rate  principally due to the successful resolution of certain issues from prior years federal income tax filings 
liquidity and capital resources the following table illustrates the sources of the company s invested capital 
the balances at december   reflect the incremental capital associated with the acquisition of midcon  including the post acquisition refinancings completed in see notes d and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
december dollars in thousands long term debt    common equity    preferred stock    capital trust securities   capitalization    short term debt    invested capital    capitalization long term debt common equity preferred stock capital trust securities invested capital total debt equity  including capital trust securities includes the  substitute note assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of midcon 
this note was repaid on january  if the government securities held as collateral were offset against the related debt  the ratio of total debt to invested capital at december   would be percent 
the following discussion of cash flows should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and related supplemental disclosures 
net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows from operating activities decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million or percent 
this decrease was principally attributable to the net impact of i an increase of approximately million in cash used to increase net working capital in  largely due to the net use of cash resulting from the changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable  ii the increase in earnings before non cash charges and credits for  iii increased cash used for gas in underground storage and iv the receipt of million in settlement of a gas contract 
net cash flows from operating activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
this increase was principally attributable to the same factors resulting in the reported increase in earnings between these years 
net cash flows from investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities increased from million in to billion in  an increase of approximately billion  principally due to i the billion of net cash paid in and ii the net use of cash for the purchases of approximately billion of us government securities as collateral for the substitute note  in each case in conjunction with the acquisition of midcon 
in addition  cash outflows for acquisitions other than midcon were approximately million less in than in and proceeds from sales of facilities increased by approximately million in net cash flows used in investing activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of million principally due to i the completion of the pony express pipeline and construction of transmission laterals into the kansas city metropolitan area  ii the acquisition of the bushton facilities in april and iii the acquisition of an interest in the red cedar gathering company  also in december net cash flows from financing activities net cash flows from financing activities increased from million in to approximately billion in  an increase of approximately billion 
this increase reflected reduced cash from short term borrowings and the receipt of i billion from the public sale of debt securities  ii million from the public sale of common stock and iii million from the public sale of capital trust securities in each case representing the refinancing of acquisition debt associated with the purchase of midcon  net of associated issuance costs of approximately million see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  cash used for dividends and long term debt retirement increased by million and million  respectively 
in march  k n issued million shares million shares after adjustment for the december three for two stock split of common stock in an underwritten public offering  receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
also in march  k n issued billion principal amount of debt securities of varying maturities and interest rates in an underwritten public offering  receiving net proceeds of approximately billion 
the net proceeds from these two offerings were used to refinance borrowings under the midcon acquisition financing arrangements and to purchase us government securities to collateralize a portion of the substitute note 
in april  k n sold million of capital securities due april   in an underwritten offering  with the net proceeds of million used to purchase us government securities to further collateralize the substitute note 
in november  k n completed the concurrent underwritten public offerings of million of year senior notes and million principal amount of premium equity participating security units peps 
the million of net proceeds from the senior notes offering were used to retire a portion of k n s then outstanding short term borrowings 
the proceeds from the peps offering was used to purchase us treasury securities on behalf of the peps owners  which securities are the property of the peps owners and will be held as collateral to fund the obligation of the peps holders to purchase k n common stock at the end of a three year period 
for additional information on each of these financings  including terms of the specific securities and the associated accounting treatment  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net cash flows from financing activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately million 
this increase was principally attributable to i additional long term debt issued in  ii the issuance of million of capital trust securities in april and iii net increases in short term borrowing in these increases were partially offset by decreased cash from the issuance of common stock 
on january   k n repaid the billion substitute note payable to occidental petroleum as part of the midcon acquisition 
the note was repaid using the proceeds of approximately billion from the sale of us government securities which had been held as collateral  with the balance of the funds provided by an increase in short term borrowings 
the company s principal sources of short term liquidity are its billion revolving bank facilities see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had million of commercial paper issued and outstanding which is backed by the bank facilities 
at february   short term borrowings had increased to approximately million  principally due to funds borrowed in conjunction with repayment of the substitute note as described preceding 
the bank facilities include covenants which are common in such arrangements  including requirements that i the ratio of the company s total debt to total capitalization not exceed percent initially upon issuance of common stock to the holders of the peps at the maturity thereof  the ratio will be reduced to percent and ii the company s consolidated net worth inclusive of trust preferred securities be at least equal to the sum of billion plus percent of consolidated net income earned for each fiscal quarter ending after december  certain of the company s operating lease arrangements provide that  in the event that the rating of k n s senior debt is lowered below investment grade by both of the two major rating agencies  the company would be required to post letters of credit in support of its remaining lease payments 
although the company currently has no information to indicate that such downgrades will occur  given the company s current level of borrowing and utilization of its letter of credit facility  the posting of these additional letters of credit in support of lease obligations would place the company in default under the terms of its revolving credit facility 
the company currently believes that  should such a default occur  it could obtain a waiver of the applicable default provisions or modification of such provisions to allow the facility to remain in place  although the pricing would likely increase 
capital expenditures and commitments capital expenditures decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due principally to the fact that capital expenditures included the costs for completion of the pony express pipeline and associated transmission laterals 
the capital expenditure budget totals approximately million 
approximately million of this amount had been committed for the purchase of plant and equipment at december  principal acquisitions or investments made during included the midcon and thermo acquisitions and the pressure reduction program in the hugoton basin 
major asset sales during included the sale of the company s kansas natural gas distribution properties  certain microwave towers and certain under performing natural gas gathering and processing facilities 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on these acquisitions  investments and sales 
common stock split and dividend action on november   the board of directors of k n energy  inc approved a percent increase in the quarterly dividend and a three for two split of the company s common stock 
the regular quarterly dividend was declared at per common share  an increase from per common share 
giving effect to the stock split  the quarterly dividend is per common share 
the stock split was distributed and the increase in dividend was paid concurrently on december   to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  regulation on january   k n interstate gas transmission co 
kni filed a general rate case with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc requesting a million increase in annual revenues 
as a result of ferc action  kni was allowed to place its rates into effect on august   subject to refund  and kni has recorded provisions for refund based on its expectation of ultimate resolution 
kni is currently following the procedural schedule established for the rate case and a hearing on its proposed rates is currently scheduled to commence on july  on december   rocky mountain natural gas company rmng  a wholly owned subsidiary of k n energy  inc  received a show cause order from the colorado public utilities commission the commission 
the commission has concluded that there is reason to believe that rmng s rates may be excessive and has ordered further investigation 
a procedural schedule has been established and a hearing is scheduled to commence on june  risk management to minimize the risk of price changes in the natural gas and ngls markets  the company uses certain financial instruments for hedging purposes 
these instruments include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange  the kansas city board of trade and over the counter markets including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts and fixed price swaps 
the company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments  but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their existing credit ratings 
pursuant to a policy approved by its board of directors  the company is to engage in these activities only as a hedging mechanism against price volatility associated with pre existing or anticipated physical gas and condensate sales  gas purchases  system use and storage in order to protect profit margins  and is not to engage in speculative trading 
commodity related activities of the risk management group are monitored by the company s risk management committee  which is charged with the review and enforcement of the board of directors risk management policy 
the risk management committee reviews the types of hedging instruments used  contract limits and approval levels and may review the pricing and hedging of any or all commodity transactions 
all energy futures  swaps and options are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of these risk management instruments reflects the estimated amounts that the company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts 
market quotes are available for substantially all financial instruments used by the company 
gains and losses on hedging positions are deferred and recognized as gas purchases expense in the periods in which the underlying physical transactions occur 
the company measures the risk of price changes in the natural gas and ngls markets utilizing a value at risk var model 
var is a statistical measure of how much the marked to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
the company utilizes a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the var computations utilize a confidence level of percent for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a percent probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the var number presented 
instruments evaluated by the model include forward physical gas  storage and transportation contracts and financial products including commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
var at december   was million and averaged million for the company s calculated var exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on the company s portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in the company s portfolio of derivatives during the year 
the company s treasury department manages the company s interest rate exposure  utilizing interest rate swaps  caps or similar derivatives within board established policy 
none of these interest rate derivatives is leveraged 
the company currently is not hedging its interest rate exposure resulting from its short term borrowings 
the market risk related to short term borrowings from a one percent change in interest rates would result in an approximate million impact on pre tax income  based on current short term borrowing levels 
there are recently issued accounting pronouncements that change the accounting and reporting requirements for certain risk management activities see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
outlook forward looking information general certain information contained herein may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of although the company believes that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained herein include  among other factors  the pace of deregulation of retail natural gas and electricity markets in the united states  federal  state and international regulatory developments  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil  natural gas  ngls  electricity  certain agricultural products and interest rates  the extent of success in acquiring natural gas facilities  the timing and success of efforts to develop power  pipeline and other projects  political developments in foreign countries  weather related factors and conditions of capital markets and equity markets during the periods covered by the forward looking statements 
all of these factors are difficult to predict and many are beyond the company s control 
readiness for year the following is a discussion of the year problem and its potential impact on the company 
the securities and exchange commission sec has issued specific guidelines for public companies regarding their disclosure of the year problem 
the guidelines require more detailed disclosure of each company s analysis of and approach to the year problem 
as a result  the company is providing the following disclosure  however  the length and detail contained in this disclosure  relative to the other disclosures contained herein  is not an indication of the company s view of the relative risk of the year problem to the company 
some computers and programs  and some devices containing computer chips embedded chips store or process dates containing the year as this can result in inaccurate date related calculations 
it is expected that once the year arrives  computers  computer programs and devices with embedded chips that have not been modified to correct this problem will not function normally 
the company relies on a number of automated systems to conduct its operations and to transact its business  as is common among large diversified energy companies 
in addition  certain of the company s pipelines and processing equipment and related systems contain electric controls or other devices containing embedded chips 
these controls may also be adversely affected by this problem 
in  the audit committee of the company s board of directors the audit committee established a year project to address the year problem 
in that year  the company established a year executive steering committee the year committee and a year project management office the year project management office 
the year project is an ongoing effort monitored by the audit committee 
the audit committee has adopted a year plan the plan and will oversee its implementation by receiving periodic reports from the year committee and directly from management 
the audit committee is prepared to require management to make additional efforts  including amending the plan as necessary  to fulfill the audit committee s goal of taking reasonable steps to minimize injury to people  damage to property  disruption to the company s delivery of products and services  supporting systems and business operations  and other risks associated with the year problem 
the year committee is charged with directing the implementation of the plan in accordance with resolutions of the audit committee and under the direction of the company s designated senior executives 
the year committee oversees the year project management office  headed by the year project coordinator 
the year committee keeps the audit committee informed of the company s progress in implementing the plan and of significant updates that are made to the plan 
the year committee communicates the audit committee s directives concerning the plan to management and executives  and oversees the implementation of those directives 
the year project management office works closely with the company s readiness teams comprised of members of the company s operating units 
the teams have been organized to further implement the plan throughout the company 
the project management office  among other things  promotes exchange of information about year problems and solutions  assists in disseminating information about the company s policies governing communications concerning year issues and serves as a conduit between the various readiness teams and the year committee 
the aim of the plan is to take reasonable steps to prevent the company s mission critical functions from being impaired due to the year problem 
mission critical describes those systems  devices  functions and external entities that are of material importance to maintaining the company s capacity to deliver and account for products and services without interruption  and to maintain the company s supporting business operations with no material disruption or diminution in quality 
each of the company s operating units is in various stages of implementing the plan to address the year problem 
these efforts include o an assessment of potential problems  o an inventory of systems and areas which may need to be corrected  o remediation and implementation  with priority given to mission critical items  o the testing of such systems and devices  and o developing contingency plans in case the company cannot correct the problem in time  or in the event certain facets of the year problem go undetected or do not manifest themselves until after january  specifically  the company is in the process of correcting programmable code  replacing non year ready embedded chips  installing year ready releases of certain vendor supplied computer systems and  in some cases  replacing existing systems with new internally or externally developed software in advance of december  the company has completed an inventory of affected items in the non information technology area and is assessing the results 
the company has begun testing and currently has found very few items that are likely to suffer adverse effects from the year problem 
the company expects testing and remediation of mission critical items to be substantially completed by mid for the company s plan to be successful  the company must rely for some purposes on outside contractors 
there is a risk that those contractors will not complete their work prior to the year the company is developing alternative ways to conduct its business if such deadlines are not met 
however  any alternative may involve additional expense and may not be implemented in time to avoid the year problem 
ultimately  these alternatives may not be successful 
the company also relies on suppliers  business partners and other external entities which may or may not be addressing their own problems associated with the year problem 
the company has sent out questionnaires to external entities to determine what steps they have taken to correct any year problems they may have 
the company has no control over such external entities efforts  so the company has developed contingency plans in case such external entities do not complete their efforts before the year the company estimates that the direct costs the company has incurred or will incur in  and associated with assessing  inventorying  remediating and testing internally developed computer applications  hardware and equipment  including embedded chip systems and third party developed software  to be between million and million 
in addition  as part of the integration of the company s systems with the systems of midcon  the company has begun modifying certain of its computer systems for the combined company or purchasing computer systems from third parties 
these computer systems will address the year problem and are expected to be operational prior to december  the costs for these computer systems are expected to be between million and million  the majority of which will be capitalized 
the sec s guidelines also require the company to address the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios resulting from the year problem 
as a result of the year problem  the company may be faced with failure of electrical  gas and similar services and supplies from utilities  disruption of telecommunications facilities  interruptions in the nation s transportation systems and failure of a substantial number of the company s mission critical hardware and software systems 
in addition  the company s key suppliers or customers may experience their own year problems in a way that materially adversely affects the company s ability to do business without interruption or disruption 
as a result of the cumulative impact of these events  the company s business may be materially adversely affected 
the adverse impact of these events occurring can not be quantified at this time 
the company is in the process of developing contingency plans to address issues associated with the reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
the company expects to have such contingency plans substantially completed by the end of june the company will then refine and update its contingency plans for the remainder of the company does not believe that the direct costs associated with the year problem will be material to its business  financial position or results of operations 
litigation and environmental the company s anticipated environmental capital costs and expenses for  including expected costs for voluntary remediation efforts  are approximately million 
a substantial portion of the company s environmental costs are either recoverable through insurance and indemnification provisions or have previously recorded liabilities associated with them 
refer to notes a and b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s pending litigation and environmental matters 
the company believes it has established adequate reserves such that the resolution of pending litigation and environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial position or results of operations 
new business venture with its thermo acquisition see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company obtained its first electric generation assets 
in addition  the company has announced plans to participate in the investment of billion over the next three to five years to build gas fired electric generation plants 
the company plans to obtain a significant amount of non recourse financing and partner with electricity companies to build plants totaling  megawatts of electric generation capacity along its current natural gas pipeline systems 
significant operating variables the company s principal exposure to price variability is with ngls processing margins 
the company attempts to mitigate this exposure by an appropriate mix of percent of proceeds  keep whole and fee based processing agreements and by the use of financial hedging instruments see risk management  elsewhere herein 
under current agreements with producers  a one cent change in average processing margins affects pre tax operating income by approximately million 
the company also has exposure to variation in natural gas prices and basis differentials  which can affect gross margins in its midstream sales  transportation and storage and downstream retail and marketing businesses 
basis differential is a term that refers to the difference in natural gas prices between two locations or two points in time 
these price differences can be affected by  among other things  natural gas supply and demand  available transportation capacity  storage inventories and deliverability  prices of alternative fuels and weather conditions 
in december  the northern border pipeline began operations on its million cubic feet per day cfd expansion project from canadian supply areas into the chicago market area  which is the terminus of ngpl s main pipeline system 
in addition  the alliance pipeline  a joint venture of several energy companies  is currently planning a billion cfd pipeline to transport natural gas from canada into the chicago market area 
the in service date for the alliance pipeline is uncertain but may be between late and in addition  various pipelines have proposed projects to take gas out of the chicago area to market areas in the northeast united states 
it is currently unknown what impact  if any  this additional pipeline capacity will have on gas prices and basis differentials for delivery points in the upper midwest
