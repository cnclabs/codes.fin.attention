item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that reflect the company s current views with respect to future matters such as gross profit  gross margins  spending levels  international operations  restructuring benefits and capital needs 
actual results may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include without limitation those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview the company  which commenced operations in  develops  markets and supports virtual machine technology which enables software applications and operating systems to be run on various computer platforms 
in january  the company announced its intention to launch a new product line 
this product line  called jeode  is based on the company s evm technology 
jeode is the company s implementation of sun s java technology developed specifically for embedded systems 
the jeode platform is enabled by the company s evm and is designed to enable software developers to create reliable  efficient and predictable embedded products 
in november  the company delivered beta versions of the jeode platform 
the product is available for sale and is expected to be the principal product line in and the foreseeable future 
in december  the company introduced its windows product line  softwindows  which enables windows applications to run on apple macintosh computers and most unix workstations 
the softwindows product line has accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenue 
however  revenue generated by softwindows has been diminishing since and future substantial revenues are not expected 
the following table lists the softwindows product releases from through year product name emulation software for softwindows macintosh and unix softwindows macintosh and unix softwindows power macintosh softwindows power macintosh softwindows power macintosh and unix realpc power macintosh softwindows power macintosh softwindows power macintosh in december  the company introduced and started shipping ntrigue  a windows compatibility client server product that supports multiple x terminals  workstation clients  macintosh computers  pcs and network computers from a windows nt based server 
in february  the company disposed of its ntrigue technology 
the company s operations outside of the united states are primarily in the united kingdom  where the majority of the company s research and development operations and its european sales activities are located 
the company distributes its softwindows product through independent distributors 
the company s revenues from customers outside the united states are derived primarily from europe and asia and are generally affected by the same factors as its revenues from customers in the united states 
the operating expenses of the company s operations outside the united states are mostly incurred in europe and relate to its research and development and european sales activities 
such expenses consist primarily of ongoing fixed costs and consequently do not fluctuate in direct proportion to revenues 
the company s revenues and expenses outside the united states can fluctuate from period to period based on movements in currency exchange rates 
historically  movements in currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on the company s revenues 
the company operates with the united states dollar as its functional currency  with a majority of revenues and operating expenses denominated in dollars 
although the company engages in short term currency option and forward exchange contracts in order to hedge short term pound sterling net cash flows  pound sterling exchange rate fluctuations against the dollar can cause european revenues and united kingdom expenses  which are translated into dollars for financial statement reporting purposes  to vary from period to period 
disposal of ntrigue technology on february  the company completed the disposal of its ntrigue technology to citrix for million 
as part of the disposal  the company transferred employees to citrix  of which were development engineers 
under the terms of the disposal agreement million was paid to the company in cash on february   and the remainder is being held in escrow for the sole purpose of satisfying any obligations to citrix arising from or in connection with an event against which the company would be required to indemnify citrix 
of this amount  citrix released million to the company in february in january the company received an indemnity claim from citrix for an amount estimated by citrix to not exceed million 
the claim is based on a declaratory relief action that citrix filed against graphon corp 
graphon in november in the united states district court  southern district of florida 
citrix action against graphon seeks a declaratory judgement that citrix does not infringe any graphon proprietary rights and that citrix has not misappropriated any trade secrets or breached an agreement to which graphon is a party 
citrix filed the action in response to and to resolve unsubstantiated assertions first made by graphon  and disclosed to citrix in january  that the company used graphon confidential information to develop certain of the company s products  possibly including products the company sold to citrix in february graphon has not filed an action against either the company or citrix relating to its assertions and the company believes such assertions by graphon are without merit or basis 
accordingly  the company intends to contest citrix indemnity claim 
revenues in thousands license revenue    service revenue    total revenues    the company derives its revenues from the sale of packaged software products and annual maintenance contracts  and in and  from royalties received from bundling agreements with oems and customer funded engineering activities under oem contracts 
revenues from the sale of packaged products and royalties received from oems are classified as license revenue  while revenues from customer funded engineering activities and annual maintenance contracts are classified as service revenue 
in  the company shipped two principal product lines softwindows and ntrigue 
total revenues and license revenues declined and  respectively in compared to in  total revenues from softwindows for macintosh declined compared to primarily as a result of increased competition and resulting price reductions of the product and declining market share for apple macintosh compatible computers 
in  and  license revenue from the sale of the company s products for macintosh computers accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively 
the company expects its jeode product line to generate revenue in revenue from the jeode product line will initially be derived from three main sources the sale of a development license  the sale of annual maintenance and support  and a commercial use royalty based on shipments of products that include jeode technology 
unix total revenues declined in compared to as a result of a decline in the number of large oem transactions 
in  and total revenues from the company s product for unix computers accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively 
total ntrigue revenues declined in compared to as a result of the disposal of the product line 
in  and total revenues from the company s ntrigue products accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively 
service revenues in declined compared to  primarily because the company performed fewer customer funded engineering activities than in the previous year 
similarly  in  service revenues declined compared to the company distributes its softwindows and realpc packaged products within the united states and internationally through distributors and resellers and  in and  also through oems 
the company offers certain return privileges to its customers including product exchange privileges and price protection 
the company recognizes revenues from packaged products upon shipment with provisions for estimated future returns  exchanges and price protection being recorded as a reduction of total revenues 
a significant portion of the company s revenue in and was derived from large oem customer transactions  particularly in the unix and nt related product lines 
sales to distributors representing more than of total revenue in each period accounted for the following percentages of total revenue 
ingram micro sun microsystems silicon graphics mitsubishi all distributors less than sales to customers outside the united states  derived mainly from customers in europe and asia  represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
movements in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on total revenues in  or however  there can be no assurance that movements in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future revenues and results of operations 
cost of revenues and gross margin in thousands  except percentages cost of license revenue    gross margin license revenue cost of service revenue    gross margin service revenue total cost of revenues    gross margin total revenues cost of license revenue primarily includes windows  pc dos and winframe royalties paid to microsoft  ibm and citrix  respectively  and costs of documentation  duplication and packaging 
cost of service revenue includes costs associated with customer funded engineering activities and end user support under maintenance contracts 
the company s distribution agreement with microsoft corporation expired on march   but was extended until september  on substantially the same terms 
the company subsequently entered into a new distribution agreement dated october  on substantially the same terms  effective for one year 
termination or expiration without renewal of the microsoft distribution agreement would result in the inability of the company to sell its softwindows products 
the company s gross margin for license revenue is significantly affected by many factors  including pricing of the company s products  royalties paid to third parties  the mix of products licensed  the channels through which the company s products are distributed and product maturity 
the company s gross margin for license revenue can also be affected in particular periods by pricing strategies and return privileges employed in connection with new product introductions and upgrades 
license gross margins in declined to from in as a result of pricing strategies  increased third party royalties  rebate programs  and obsolescence of inventory 
license gross margins in declined to from in as a result of lower prices introduced in mid as a result of increased competition in the softwindows for the macintosh market and fewer high margin oem customer transactions 
the company believes that the significant factors affecting the jeode gross margin will include pricing of the development license  pricing of the unit usage and royalties to third parties such as sun microsystems 
in early  the company signed a five year agreement with sun microsystems under which sun established the company as an authorized virtual machine provider 
under this agreement the company will pay sun a per unit royalty on each jeode enabled embedded product shipped by the company s customers  plus a royalty on all development licenses put in place between the company and its customers 
gross margin for service revenue is impacted by the level of and pricing terms of customer funded engineering activities  which can vary from customer to customer  from contract to contract  the level of maintenance contracts sold and the level of softwindows license revenue earned 
in and  the company earned little revenue from customer funded engineering acitivities  and saw a decline in unix maintenance agreements sold 
this  combined with the high cost of providing support under ntrigue maintenance contracts  resulted in the company achieving service revenue gross margins of in  and in gross margins in for service revenues were service revenue gross margins for are expected to increase due to the required maintenance and upgrade contracts for each jeode product sale 
operating expenses in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing    percentage of total revenues research and development    percentage of total revenues general and administrative    percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional expenses  trade shows  personnel and related overhead costs  and salesperson commissions 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in by as a result of reduced advertising and promotional expenditures  and a reduction in personnel costs 
in  sales and marketing costs decreased by over primarily due to reduced advertising and promotional expenditures  and a reorganization of the sales force resulting in a reduction in personnel costs 
the company anticipates sales and marketing expenses to increase in as the company develops a marketing and direct sales organization for its jeode product line 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  overhead costs relating to occupancy and equipment depreciation 
research and development expenses decreased in by over as a result of reductions in personnel associated with the disposal of the ntrigue product line 
during the last half of  the company invested the majority of its development expense in its jeode technology to accelerate the release of this product 
research and development costs decreased by in over as a result of reductions in personnel 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established  after which any additional costs are capitalized 
in  and  no development expenditures were capitalized 
development costs will increase in as the company further develops its jeode technology 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for finance  information systems  human resources and general management 
general and administrative expenses decreased by in over as a result of reduced headcount  reduced legal fees and reduced facility costs 
general and administrative expenses increased by in over as a result of significant legal expenses incurred in defending certain legal actions taken against the company 
offsetting such fees were personnel cost reductions resulting from the company reorganizing its finance and administrative groups  and reduced facilities costs as a result of the company closing its boston office 
general and administrative costs are not expected to change significantly in compared to restructuring in thousands  except percentages restructuring  percentage of total revenues in  the company completed two restructurings 
in the first restructure  the company reduced headcount by persons and integrated product development  product marketing and the sales organization into two business units 
in the second restructure  the company combined the two sales organizations into one unit  reducing headcount by persons  reorganized the sales force such that direct sales inquiries are now referred to distributors  and reduced the number of facilities it operates from 
restructuring expenses  which represented of total revenues in  consist principally of costs related to terminated employees  including serverance payments and stock option related expenses  and future rents on facilities no longer used by the company 
as a result of the two restructurings  the company saved approximately million in interest income expense  net in thousands  except percentages interest income  net  percentage of total revenues interest income  net increased in over due primarily to increased interest income earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments  which increased from million at december  to million at december  interest income  net decreased in over due primarily to decreased interest income earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments  which declined from million at december  to million at december  other income expense  net in thousands  except percentages other income expense  net  percentage of total revenues less than other income expense  net increased from an expense of  in to income of million in  of which was the net gain on the disposal of the company s ntrigue product line and the majority of the remainder was foreign exchange gains 
over of the company s total revenues and approximately of its operating expenses are denominated in united states dollars 
most of the remaining revenues and expenses of the company are pound sterling denominated and consequently the company is exposed to fluctuations in pound sterling exchange rates 
to hedge against this currency exposure  the company enters into foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts for periods and amounts consistent with the amounts and timing of its anticipated pound sterling denominated operating cash flow requirements 
unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency option contracts are deferred and were not material at december  and december  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company has an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company attempts to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
provision benefit for income taxes in thousands  except percentages provision benefit for income taxes  effective income tax rate n a n a the company recorded a tax provision in reflecting certain non us taxes arising upon the disposal of the company s ntrigue product line  net of offsetting operating losses 
the company recorded a tax benefit in reflecting the utilization of united kingdom operating tax losses against prior year taxes paid 
in the company had a tax provision in spite of its pretax loss  primarily due to foreign withholding taxes related to us royalties from japanese customers 
normally  the company receives a us federal tax credit to offset such foreign withholding taxes but could not do so in due to being in a net operating loss tax position 
a more complete analysis of the differences between the federal statutory rate and the company s effective income tax rates is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets  primarily comprising net operating losses  on the basis that significant uncertainty exists with respect to their realization 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash  cash equivalents and investments    working capital    net cash used in operating activities    the company is in the process of transitioning its product focus from windows emulation and windows compatability products to its jeode product line based on the company s evm technology 
this change in product focus has resulted in a redirection of available resources from the company s historical revenue base towards the development and marketing efforts associated with the jeode platform  which was not released for general availability until march as a result of this change in product strategy and associated redirection of resources to new product development  the company s financial position weakened significantly during at december   the company s working capital totaled million  of which million was restricted and held in escrow  as compared to working capital of million at december  during  cash used in operating activities totaled million and the principle source of cash funding came from the sale in february of the ntrigue product line for million 
million of the ntrigue sales proceeds was received in february  million was received in february and the remaining million is being held in escrow pending resolution of the citrix indemnity claim 
capital additions totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company continues to face significant risks associated with the successful execution of its new product strategy 
these risks include  but are not limited to continued technology and product development  introduction and market acceptance of new products  changes in the marketplace  liquidity  competition from existing and new competitors which may enter the marketplace and retention of key personnel 
due to the generally longer sales cycles expected to be associated with the jeode platform  the company does not currently have accurate visibility of future order rates and demand for its products generally 
there can be no assurance that jeode platform products will achieve market acceptance 
the company believes that additional financing will be necessary before december   as its existing cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to meet the company s operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
the company to date has made no commitments nor agreed to any arrangements to obtain additional financing  but is currently considering various financing alternatives 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such funding when needed  on acceptable terms or at all 
the failure to raise additional funds on a timely basis and on sufficiently favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s liquidity may be adversely affected in the future by factors such as higher interest rates  inability to borrow without collateral  availability of capital financing and continued operating losses 
further  significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results has had and  in the future  may continue to have a negative affect on the company s liquidity 
factors such as price reductions  the introduction and market acceptance of new products and product returns have contributed to this quarterly variability 
moreover  the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future sales levels  and a shortfall in expected sales could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in results of operations 
as such  the results of operations in some future period may be below the expectations of investors  which would likely result in a significant reduction in the market price of the company s shares 
a decline in the market price of the company s shares would have a negative effect on the company s ability to raise needed capital on terms and conditions acceptable to management 
year compliance it is generally anticipated that many organizations will experience operational difficulties at the beginning of the year as a result of the fact that many currently installed computer systems  embedded systems  and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
significant uncertainty exists in the software and other industries concerning the scope and magnitude of problems associated with the century change 
the company s assessment of the impact of this issue has encompassed software held for resale  internally utilized systems  computerized information and software provided by third parties which might be integral to customer usage of the company s products  compliance issues related entirely to the state of readiness by customers and vendors and year cost 
set forth below is the status of each review and the estimated impact  to the extent management can determine at this time 
software held for resale based on the company s assessment to date  the company believes that all versions of jeode  softwindows products  softwindows products  realpc and ntrigue  a product the company no longer ships  are year compliant 
earlier versions of softwindows and all versions of soft pc  a product the company no longer ships  are not year compliant  but all such versions are upgradable to year compliant products 
however  there can be no assurance that all of the company s customers will install the year compliant version of the company s products in a timely manner  which could lead to failure of customer systems and product liability claims against the company 
even if the company s products are year compliant  the company may in the future be subject to claims based on year issues in the products of other companies  or issues arising from the integration of multiple products within a system 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liability of the company for year damages  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
internal systems the company has carried out an assessment of its own internal systems and believes that they are all year compliant 
third party systems the company has reviewed its material third party relationships such as key suppliers and distributors 
the company believes all computerized information and software provided by third parties that might be integral to customer usage of the company s products is year compliant 
although the company believes that its internal critical processes are year ready  the company also recognizes that it is vulnerable  as are most organizations  to the inability of third party external interface suppliers  and utility organizations to achieve year readiness 
the most reasonable worst case scenario could include failure of power and water supplies  major transportation disruptions  and failures of communications and financial systems any one of which could have a major and material effect on the company s ability to produce its products and deliver services to its customers 
while the company has contingency plans in place to address most issues under its control  a problem outside its control could result in a delay in product shipments depending on the nature and severity of the problems 
customers and vendors the company s products are generally used with systems and software involving complicated software products developed by other vendors  which may not be year compliant 
failure of the information systems of the company s customers because of the failure of such noncompliant systems or software or for any other reason  could also affect the perceived performance of the company s products  which could have a negative effect on the company s competitive position 
in addition  the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year cost the total cost associated with preparation for the year has not been  and is not expected to be  material to the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
nevertheless  the company may not timely identify and remediate all significant year problems and remedial efforts may involve significant time and expense 
there can be no assurance that any year compliance problems of the company or its customers or suppliers will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

potential fluctuations in operating results the company s revenues  margins and operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including demand for the company s products  acceptance and demand for java technology in the embedded products market  demand for macintosh computers and unix workstations  product life cycles  the introduction  acceptance and delivery of new products and product enhancements by the company  apple  microsoft  unix workstation vendors or their competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  changes in the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are offered  purchasing patterns of distributors and retailers  quality control of products sold  competitive conditions in the industry and economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas 
although the company s primary functional currency is the united states dollar  a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are incurred by its united kingdom operations and paid in pounds sterling 
the company enters into short term currency option and forward exchange contracts to hedge the short term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on pound sterling net operating cash flows  but there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations in the future 
a relatively high percentage of the company s expenses is fixed over the short term and  as a result  if anticipated revenues in any quarter do not occur or are delayed  expenditure levels could be disproportionately high as a percentage of total revenues and the company s operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected 
the company historically has operated with little backlog because its products are generally shipped as orders are received 
as a result  revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and on sales by distributors and other resellers 
in addition  the company has at times recognized a substantial portion of its revenues from sales booked and shipped in the last month of the quarter such that the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations may not become evident until late in  or at the end of  a particular quarter 
some orders for the company s unix products are significant in size and orders for the company s jeode product are expected to be significant in size 
if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  the company is unlikely to be able to generate revenue from alternate sources in time to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result  and due to the relatively large size of some orders  a lost or delayed sale could have a material adverse effect on the company s quarterly operating results 
moreover  to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than expected  operating results for subsequent quarters may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company intends to make a significant investment in its marketing  sales  customer support and research and development infrastructure to support its jeode product line 
the timing of this expansion and the rate at which jeode generates revenue could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
although historically the company s business has not been subject to seasonal variations  sales of the company s products in certain international markets  such as europe  are typically slower in the summer months 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s adss would likely be materially adversely affected 
future operating results except for the historical information contained in this annual report  the matters discussed herein are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements concern matters which include  but are not limited to  the development of new products  enhancements or technologies  particularly the development of jeode  the timing of the availability of jeode  the jeode product and service offerings  the revenue model and market for jeode  the features  benefits and advantages of jeode  international sales  the availability of licenses to third party proprietary rights  business and sales strategies  matters relating to proprietary rights  competition  year compliance  facilities needs  exchange rate fluctuations and the company s liquidity and capital needs and other statements regarding matters that are not historical are forward looking statements 
these matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
in addition to the factors discussed above  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following the company s ability to deliver on time  and market acceptance of jeode or other new products or upgrades of existing products  the timing of  or delay in  large customer orders  continued availability of technology and intellectual property license rights  product life cycles  the demand for macintosh computers and unix workstations  the introduction  acceptance and delivery of hardware and or operating systems by macintosh and unix vendors  microsoft corporation or their competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  changes in the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are offered  purchasing patterns of distributors and retailers  quality control of products sold  competitive conditions in the industry  economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas  and the risks listed from time to time in the reports that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission 
there can be no assurance that the company will experience growth in revenues and net income in any particular period when compared to prior periods 
any quarterly or annual shortfall in net revenues and or net income from the levels expected by securities analysts and shareholders would result in a substantial decline in the trading price of the company s shares 
restatement of quarterly results the company determined that certain individuals in its us channel sales organization violated company policy by entering into unauthorized agreements with certain distributors and resellers  and by failing to report those agreements to the company s finance department 
in addition  the company discovered that certain individuals in its us channel sales organization did not accurately report to its finance department the amount and status of unsold inventories of the company s products at certain of the company s resellers 
the individuals who were involved in these events were disciplined or are no longer with the company 
at the direction of the audit committee of its board of directors  the company implemented additional accounting and reporting controls to help prevent future breaches of company policies 
upon the discovery of the aforementioned  the company conducted a review of the company s compliance with its revenue recognition policy 
as a result of this review  the company identified certain transactions in which revenue and related expenses were recognized other than in accordance with its accounting policies 
as part of this review  the company also reversed certain sales to a new distributor that had been granted broad rights of return 
accordingly  the company restated its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the first and second quarters of to reflect these adjustments 
all quarterly information presented in this annual report reflect the restated quarterly information for
