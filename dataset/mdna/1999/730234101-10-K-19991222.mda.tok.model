item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s net income is primarily affected by its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities  and investment portfolios  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  including fhlb advances 
the company s net income also is affected by its provisions for losses on loans and investments in real estate  as well as the amount of noninterest income including fees and service charges and gains or losses on sales of loans  and noninterest expense  including salaries and employee benefits  premises and equipment expense  data processing expense  federal deposit insurance premiums and income taxes 
net income of the company also is affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory authorities 
certain statements in this report which relate to the company s plans  objectives or future performance may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation act of such statements are based on management s current expectations 
actual strategies and results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of various risks and uncertainties 
additional discussion of factors affecting the company s business and prospects is contained in periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
market risk analysis general 
it is the objective of the company to minimize  to the degree prudently possible  its exposure to interest rate risk  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
interest rate spread is the difference between the company s yield on its interest earning assets and its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk is generally understood to be the sensitivity of the company s earnings  net asset values  and stockholders equity to changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the company s earnings 
the effect on earnings of changes in interest rates generally depends on how quickly the company s yield on interest earnings assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities react to the changes in market rates of interest 
if the company s cost of deposit accounts reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the yield on the company s mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets  then an increasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the company s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to favorably affect the company s earnings 
on the other hand  if the company s yield on its mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the company s cost of deposit accounts  then an increasing rate environment is likely to favorably affect the company s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the company s earnings 
net portfolio value 
the value of the company s loan and investment portfolio will change as interest rates change 
rising interest rates will generally decrease the company s net portfolio value npv  while falling interest rates will generally increase the value of that portfolio 
the following tables set forth  quantitatively  as of september  and  the ots estimate of the projected changes in npv in the event of a   and basis point instantaneous and permanent increase and decrease in market interest rates change in change in npv interest rates as a percentage of in basis points net portfolio value estimated market rate shock amount change change ratio value of assets dollars in thousands change in change in npv interest rates as a percentage of in basis points net portfolio value estimated market rate shock amount change change ratio value of assets dollars in thousands computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are calculated by the ots from data provided by the company and are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit runoffs  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
management cannot predict future interest rates or their effect on the company s npv in the future 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  which represent the company s primary loan product  have features that restrict changes in interest rates during the initial term and over the remaining life of the asset 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans in the company s portfolio could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity if market rates decrease 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of changes in financial condition general 
the company s total assets increased million  or  from million at september  to million at september  total assets increased million  or  from million at september  to million at september  loans receivable  net 
the company s net loans receivable increased approximately million  or  and million  or  in fiscal years and  respectively from the prior years 
the increases in both periods were due to loan demand within the company s market area 
the increase in was also due to the purchase of a million portfolio of loans 
investment securities 
the investment securities portfolio increased approximately million or from september   to million at september  in accordance with the company s present strategy  the principal paydowns and maturities of investments were used to fund loan growth 
the investment securities portfolio decreased million  or to million at september   compared to million at september  cash surrender value of life insurance 
during the year ended september   the company purchased life insurance on the lives of executive officers and members of the board of directors 
such life insurance had cash surrender value of million and million at september  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was due to earnings on the cash surrender value  net of premiums paid 
other assets 
other assets increased million from september  to september   primarily due to the increase of million in the net deferred tax asset 
deferred income taxes increased mainly as a result of the increase in deferred compensation discussed below 
deposits 
historically  deposits have provided the company with a stable source of relatively low cost funding 
the market for deposits is competitive  which has caused the company to utilize primarily certificate accounts that are more responsive to market interest rates rather than passbook accounts 
the company offers a traditional line of deposit products that currently includes checking  interest bearing checking  savings  certificates of deposit  commercial checking and money market accounts 
the million  or  increase in deposits during the year ended september   was primarily due to core deposit growth in the bank s market areas 
fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements 
the company also relies upon fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements as a source to fund assets 
approximately and of the company s assets were funded with fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements as of september  and  respectively 
at september   fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements totaled million  an increase of million  or  from fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements totaled million at september   a decrease of million  or from  reflecting  in part  the increased deposits resulting from the company s acquisition of branches during and the proceeds from company s second step stock offering 
deferred compensation 
deferred compensation increased approximately million between september  and  mainly due to an agreement entered into with a former executive requiring payments totaling million plus interest 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity decreased million  or  from million to million at september  this was primarily due to stock repurchases of million  dividends paid of million and net income of million 
stockholders equity increased by million or  to million at september  from september  this was primarily due to the second step conversion completed on march  concurrent with the second step conversion  the company sold  additional shares to members of the mutual holding company  employees of the bank and the public at a price of per share 
reorganization and stock offering costs of approximately  resulted in net proceeds from the offering of approximately discussion of results of operations overview 
net income was million for fiscal  compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s average interest earning assets have increased over the three year period ended september   which has resulted in higher levels of interest income 
the company s net interest rate spread increased to for the year ended september   from for the year ended september   and for the year ended september  the increase in net interest rate spread was a result of an increase in average loans outstanding  a decrease in average investments outstanding  a decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds and  in fiscal  an increase in deposits and a decrease in borrowed funds 
net interest income 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest rate spread is impacted by changes in general market interest rates  including changes in the relation between short and long term interest rates the yield curve  and the company s interest rate sensitivity position 
while management seeks to manage its business to limit the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates  different aspects of its business nevertheless remain subject to risk from interest rate changes 
net interest income was million for fiscal compared to million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
the tables below analyze net interest income by component and in terms of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the changes in the related yields and rates 
the company s interest earning assets are primarily comprised of single family mortgage loans and investment securities  which are primarily mortgage backed securities 
interest bearing liabilities primarily include deposits and fhlb advances 
the increases in average interest earning assets during fiscal   and can be attributed to increases in the loan portfolio  funded primarily with deposits and fhlb advances and increases in capital 
see discussion of changes in financial condition for a discussion of the company s asset portfolio and capital resources and liquidity for discussion of borrowings 
increased net interest income resulted from higher average loans outstanding and improved net interest rate spreads during fiscal and the average balance of interest earning assets increased million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the net interest rate spread increased basis points  basis points and basis points in fiscal   and  respectively 
average loans receivable increased to of average total interest earning assets in fiscal from in and in the majority of the company s interest earning assets are comprised of adjustable rate assets 
the company s adjustable rate loans and investment securities are subject to periodic interest rate caps 
periodic caps limit the amount by which the interest rate on a particular mortgage loan may increase at its next interest rate reset date 
in a rising rate environment  the interest rate spread could be negatively impacted when the repricing of interest earning assets is delayed or prohibited  compared to market interest rate movements  as a result of periodic interest rate caps 
fiscal also benefited from the proceeds of the sale of stock which provided approximately million to purchase investment securities or repay borrowings

the average yield on interest earning assets decreased to in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  while the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to from and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the average yield on interest earning assets was largely due to an increase in average loans receivable  net and a decrease in average investments receivable 
the decrease in average cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in average deposits and decrease in average borrowed funds 
the increase in average deposits was primarily due to the acquisition of approximately million of deposits in january of and the acquisition of approximately million of deposits in september  provision for loan losses 
the bank provided for loan losses of  and  respectively  in the fiscal years ended september    and management considered several factors in determining the necessary level of its allowance for loan losses  including but not limited to historical loan losses and current delinquency rates 
as a result of the process  management determined the allowance to be appropriate 
noninterest income 
non interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   and million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase in was primarily due to an increase in fee income due to an increase in demand deposit accounts and a smaller loss on equity trading securities

income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended september   was 
million compared to million for the year ended september   and million for the year ended september  the decrease from to was primarily due to a decrease in income before tax and an increase in tax exempt income 
liquidity and capital resources the bank is required to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which varies from time to time depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the bank adjusts liquidity as appropriate to meet its asset and liability management objectives 
at september   the bank was in compliance with such liquidity requirements 
the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities  fhlb advances  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans  and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a desired deposit balance 
for additional information about cash flows from the bank s operating  financing  and investing activities  see consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at september   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
fdic insurance premiums and assessment in september  congress enacted legislation to recapitalize the saif by a one time assessment on all saif insured deposits held as of march  the assessment was basis points per in deposits  payable on november  for the bank  the assessment amounted to  or  after consideration of tax benefits  based on the bank s saif insured deposits of million 
in addition  beginning january   pursuant to the legislation  interest payments on fico bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation were paid jointly by bif insured institutions and saif insured institutions 
the fico assessment will be basis points per in bif deposits and basis points per in saif deposits 
beginning in january   the fico interest payments will be paid pro rata by banks and thrifts based on deposits approximately basis points per in deposits 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
sfas requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
the company is required to classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of the statement of financial condition 
also in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  establishing standards for the way public enterprises report information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the company adopted sfas and during the year ended september  the adoption of sfas and did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 employer s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
 and sfas 
the statement revises employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
it standardizes the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits to the extent practicable  requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets that will facilitate financial analysis  and eliminates certain disclosures that are no longer as useful as they were when fasb statements no 
 no 
 and no 
were issued 
the statement suggests combined formats for presentation of pension and other postretirement benefit disclosures 
this statement was adopted by the company during the year ended september  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
on july  as permitted by sfas no 
 on july   the company transferred securities previously classified as held to maturity with a carrying value of approximately  and a fair value of approximately  into the available for sale category  where their carrying value became their fair value 
this transfer resulted in a approximately  unrealized gain  net of tax  at july  the other provisions of sfas no 
had no material effect on the company 
year changing from the year to has the potential to cause problems in data processing and other date sensitive systems  a problem known as the year or yk dilemma 
the year date change can affect any system that uses computer software programs or computer chips  including automated equipment and machinery 
for example  many software programs or computer chips store calendar dates as two digits rather than four digit numbers 
these software programs record the year as this approach will work until the year when may be read as instead of regarding the company  computer systems are used to perform financial calculations  track deposits and loan payments  transfer funds and make direct deposits 
the processing of the company s loan and deposit transactions is outsourced to a third party data processing vendor 
computer software and computer chips also are used to run security systems  vaults  communications networks and other essential bank equipment 
because of its reliance on these systems including those used by its third party data processing vendor  the company is following a comprehensive process to ensure that such systems are ready for the year date change 
to become yk compliant  the company is following a five step process suggested by federal bank regulatory agencies 
a description of each of the steps and the status of the company s efforts in completing the steps is as follows step awareness and understanding of the problem 
the company has formed a year team that has investigated the problem and its potential impact on the company s systems 
this phase also includes education of the company s employees and customers about yk issues 
the awareness and understanding phase of this step has been completed 
training and communication has taken place and will continue through step identification of all potentially affected systems 
this step has included a review of all major information technology it and non information technology non it systems to determine how they are impacted by yk issues 
an inventory has been prepared of all vendors who render it and non it services to the company 
this step is considered complete 
step assessment and planning 
the year team has completed its assessment of which systems and equipment are most prone to placing the company at risk if they are not yk compliant 
the project team has developed an inventory of its vendors  an inventory of actions to be taken  identification of the team members responsible for completion of each action  a completion timetable and a project tracking methodology 
significant vendors have been requested to advise the company in writing of their yk readiness  including actions to become compliant if they are not already compliant 
a plan has been developed to repair or replace systems and equipment not currently yk compliant 
this step is considered complete 
step correction and testing 
the company s third party data processing services as well as vendors who provide significant technology related services have modified their systems to become yk compliant 
it has also arranged for repair or replacement of equipment programs affected by yk issues 
the testing and corrections have taken place 
step implementation 
this step includes repair or replacement of systems and computer equipment and the development of contingency plans 
the repair and replacement phase is completed 
contingency plans for how the company would resume business if unanticipated problems arise from non performance by it and non it vendors has been completed and tested 
the company s efforts to become yk compliant are being monitored by its federal banking regulators 
failure to be yk compliant could subject the company to formal supervisory or enforcement actions 
the company s expenses related to yk have not been material 
the company expects to incur additional costs to become yk compliant 
it does not expect such costs to be material to the operating expenses of the company 
some of the costs are not expected to be incremental to the company  but rather represent new equipment and software that would otherwise be purchased in the normal course of the company s business 
the company presently believes the yk issue will not pose significant operating problems for the company 
however  if implementation and testing plans are not completed in a satisfactory and timely manner  in particular by third parties on which the company is dependent  or other unforeseen problems arise  the yk issue could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company
