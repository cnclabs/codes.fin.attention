item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview below  we review our operations for  and  with particular focus on  our first year of commercial operation 
we also discuss some of our current plans for in reading the discussion below  you should keep in mind that it contains forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties that affect our future operating results 
those factors include  but are not limited to  uncertainties related to the fact that pathogenesis began commercial operations only recently  its dependence on tobi  third party reimbursement and product pricing  government regulation  drug development and clinical trials  competition and alternative therapies 
a discussion of some of those factors is included in exhibit of this report 
we began marketing our first drug  tobi r tobramycin solution for inhalation  in the us in january in our first year of operation  our person sales force sold million of tobi in the us in march  we filed for approval to market tobi to cystic fibrosis patients in canada 
that approval was received in february  and we expect to begin marketing tobi in canada in the second quarter of also in february  we received marketing clearance for tobi from regulatory authorities in argentina 
we applied for regulatory approval in the u 
k 
in august  and currently expect clearance in the third quarter of following the u 
k 
approval  we will seek regulatory approvals in other european union countries under the mutual recognition process 
in addition  we applied for regulatory approval of tobi in australia  and have been granted a priority review 
on march   we announced that first quarter sales would be lower than originally expected due to fluctuations in ordering patterns for tobi 
our analysis in late march suggested that in the fourth quarter of  some patients and wholesalers for insurance or business reasons accelerated tobi purchases that might otherwise have occurred in the first quarter of other factors  including those referred to in sales and marketing  also may have affected sales 
in addition  our surveys led us to believe growth had slowed in the number of new patients who began taking tobi in the first quarter 
therefore  we also lowered our expectations of sales in and however  we continue to believe that tobi s sales potential in the u 
s 
cystic fibrosis market remains highly promising  based on our clinical trial data 
in order to further penetrate this market  we have added seven sales people to our person sales force in the first quarter 
this sales force will focus on convincing doctors to prescribe tobi for more patients and on increasing the number of prescriptions written for chronic tobi use days on drug  days off drug as specified in the tobi label 
in preparation for a second quarter launch of tobi in canada  we are establishing sales and marketing capability to be headquartered in montreal 
also beginning in the second quarter  we plan to market tobi in argentina through a distributor 
in addition we have hired four salespeople in the uk in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval in the third quarter of in  we plan to begin enrolling cystic fibrosis patients in a day open label  randomized clinical trial in up to cystic fibrosis centers in the uk and ireland 
this is expected to be the largest study of nebulized antibiotics conducted in europe to date 
while this study is not required for regulatory approval  it will give clinicians in europe hands on experience with tobi 
as of year end  compassionate use programs for tobi had begun in the uk  ireland and germany 
in october  we reported month clinical trial data on tobi at the north american cystic fibrosis conference 
one important finding demonstrated that cystic fibrosis patients continued to maintain improved lung function above baseline values after months of the chronic intermittent tobi treatment regimen 
the data also established that delay of tobi therapy led to irreversible loss of lung function 
we intend to present month data about tobi s efficacy and safety at future scientific meetings 
we conducted the following phase ii clinical trials in 
tobi for bronchiectasis 
rifalazil pa for tuberculosis 
tobi for tuberculosis in progress as of the first quarter of in january  we reported positive results from the bronchiectasis trial 
bacterial levels in the sputum decreased more than on average in the tobi treatment group at days  compared to no change on average in the placebo group 
this difference was statistically significant 
because of the strength of these results  we intend to pursue a phase iii clinical trial on bronchiectasis and additional clinical work in severe chronic bronchitis and ventilator dependent patients 
the phase ii results from the clinical trial of rifalazil showed that the drug was well tolerated 
however  there were an insufficient number of patients in each arm of the trial to provide conclusive indication of efficacy 
we have decided not to pursue additional clinical trials of rifalazil for the treatment of tuberculosis at this time 
we are developing two other inhaled drug candidates for lung infections 
pa polymyxin e 
pa we have a patent for pa  the second entry in our planned portfolio of aerosolized antibiotics to treat chronic lung infections 
in  we received a two year grant totaling million from the cystic fibrosis foundation to help support the development of pa in  we plan to begin a phase i clinical trial of this drug candidate 
in september  we acquired an exclusive worldwide license from bristol myers squibb to develop and market pa  an antibiotic 
we plan to formulate pa for non systemic aerosolized delivery for the treatment or prophylaxis of respiratory tract infectious diseases  consistent with our strategy of developing a portfolio of aerosolized antibiotics 
in may  we acquired all rights of the cystic fibrosis foundation in tobi 
the foundation s rights in tobi were acquired in return for three annual payments to the foundation totaling million 
results of operations years ended december  and we had an operating loss in  primarily due to the licensing of pa from bristol myers squibb 
excluding the million initial license fee for the aerosolized drug candidate  we would have reported income from operations of million for the year 
the operating results reflected a planned increase in operating expenses and costs incurred in manufacturing and marketing tobi  compared to  when the drug was not on the market 
in addition  we continued to engage in research and development of potential new products 
based on our current sales expectations for tobi and planned increased expenditures relating to the launch of tobi in other markets  we anticipate that we will incur a loss in revenues 
revenues in totaled million  including million from tobi sales 
research grants and royalties generated the balance of  revenues for were  which were entirely generated by research grants and royalties 
we now know that sales in the fourth quarter of were not as indicative of first quarter sales as we had anticipated and in fact  first quarter sales will be below our earlier expectations 
to increase tobi sales and further penetrate the us cystic fibrosis market  we are working to convince physicians to prescribe tobi for more patients and to increase the number of prescriptions they write for chronic use days on drug  days off drug 
we also intend to introduce tobi in international markets  such as canada and the u 
k 
however  there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
operating expenses 
we incurred total operating expenses of million in  an increase of million from million in the costs of manufacturing and marketing tobi accounted for the majority of the increase 
the million license fee to bristol myers squibb also represents a significant portion of the increase 
in addition  research and development expenses rose as we continued to develop new drug candidates and pursue regulatory approval of tobi in canada  europe and other markets 
we expect operating expenses to continue to rise in as production and marketing of tobi expand further and research and development efforts progress 
cost of sales was million in we did not incur such costs in because sales did not begin until we expect cost of sales as a percentage of sales to rise in as production volume is adjusted for revised sales expectations and as we introduce tobi in markets outside the u 
s 
our research and development expense for increased by million to million from million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in those expenses primarily reflects the costs associated with supporting our sales and marketing effort  adding administrative staff and developing a sales and marketing program in europe 
net income loss 
we had an operating loss of million in  a decrease of million from the operating loss of million in this decline in operating loss was due to tobi sales revenues in including net other income primarily income from investment securities  our net income for was million  compared to a net loss of million in in  net investment income decreased by million to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower average invested cash balances 
interest expense in totaled  which represents the amortization of the discount on the remaining installments of the obligation to the cystic fibrosis foundation 
we had no interest expense in years ended december  and revenues from grants and royalties were  in  an increase of  from revenues were comprised of income received from a two year competitive grant from the fda and royalties from sales of a proprietary combinatorial chemistry system invented by pathogenesis and bohdan automation  inc research and development expense increased by million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increases in personnel and professional costs relating to clinical development  filing of a new drug application in the us  and costs related to registration of tobi in europe 
general and administrative expense increased by million to million in from million in such increase was due to higher personnel and professional costs relating to marketing and recruiting 
we implemented a sales and marketing program in the second half of investment income  net increased by million to million in from million in this increase was due to higher invested balances 
liquidity and capital resources prior to  we relied principally on equity financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and investment securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million from the balance of million at december  we expect that these funds  in combination with expected revenues from sales of tobi  should be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition  on february   we obtained a million revolving line of credit from harris trust and savings bank 
we expect a net cash inflow from operations of approximately million to million for we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million to million in in addition  the second installment payment of million to the cystic fibrosis foundation will be due in may this cash flow projection does not include the effects of any licensing or collaboration agreements which we may enter into in the primary uses of cash and investments during were to finance our operations and working capital requirements 
accounts receivable and inventories increased by million and million  respectively  in net cash used in operating activities totaled million for  compared to million in the decrease in net cash used resulted principally from cash generated from sales of tobi  which was launched at the beginning of in addition  we made the first installment payment of million for the rights in tobi acquired from the cystic fibrosis foundation  and purchased property and equipment totaling million in at december   our working capital was million and current ratio was to we plan to continue our policy of investing excess funds in government securities and investment grade  interest bearing securities  primarily those with an expected maturity of one and one half years or less 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosure about derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments 
at december   we had tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which will begin to expire in we also have orphan drug credits of approximately million  which will expire beginning in year many computer systems may experience difficulty in processing dates beyond the year and will need to be modified before the year failure to make such modifications could result in system failures or miscalculations  disrupting operations 
most of our information technology purchases were made after january since our systems are relatively new and there were no legacy systems to integrate  and based on the program described below  we believe our internal software and hardware systems will function properly when the year arrives 
therefore  we do not expect our year compliance costs to exceed  in  excluding the costs of technology upgrades made in the ordinary course of business 
our ongoing compliance program includes verification testing of our internal information technology and information systems 
according to the vendors of those systems  all the systems purchased after january are year compliant ie  they support proper processing of date sensitive transactions after 
the existing systems that are not year compliant represent a small percentage of our systems 
we anticipate that almost all noncompliant systems will be replaced as part of normal technology upgrades before january  we will evaluate the remaining systems on an individual basis 
we expect upgrades and replacements to be made by mid  where necessary 
we are in contact with key third parties  such as suppliers  customers and financial institutions  to assure no interruption of our business relationships occur due to year compliance issues 
however  if the needed conversions or modifications to computer or other systems are not made  or are not completed in a timely way by these third parties  the year issue could have a material impact on our operations 
while we believe that our hardware and software applications are or will be year compliant  there can be no assurance that all systems will function adequately when the year arrives  nor can there be any assurance that we will not be adversely affected by the year problems of third parties 
in the case of internal system malfunctions  or in the event our suppliers and vendors are not year compliant  we are developing manual backup procedures to mitigate the risk of loss associated with the year issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt securities included in our investment portfolio 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
we invest in government securities and high quality corporate issuers 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   we owned million in government debt instruments and million in corporate debt securities 
our exposure to losses as a result of interest rate changes is managed through investing in securities predominantly with maturities of one and one half years or less
