approximately of the company s net sales for fiscal were generated in the third quarter 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for quarterly financial data 
year to year comparisons of quarterly results and comparable store net sales can be affected by a variety of factors  including the success and timing of new releases by manufacturers  the timing and duration of the holiday selling seasons and the timing of new store openings and sales promotions 
effect of economic patterns and inflation while the company attempts to pass on increases in costs and expenses from operations  its ability to do so may be limited by competitive factors 
although the company s operations are affected by general economic trends  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of its operations in the last three fiscal years 
year compliance state of readiness 
the company has completed evaluation of its information technology issues relative to computer programs being unable to distinguish between the year and the year as a result of such review  the company has concluded that its point of sale information systems will need to be upgraded 
the company has selected a replacement system  which will be installed beginning in july and anticipates completion before the christmas selling season subsequent to such installation  testing will be conducted of such systems to verify year compliance 
in addition  the company has determined that reprogramming of certain of its other proprietary information systems programs will be required 
such reprogramming has begun and is approximately completed 
it is anticipated that such reprogramming will be completed by august  after which time testing of such reprogrammed systems for year compliance will be conducted 
the company s evaluation of year issues relating to non information technology systems  such as embedded microchips and automatic processors  is substantially completed 
the company has not yet identified any material problems in this area 
the company is dependent upon music suppliers from whom it purchases products 
based upon informal inquiries  the company believes that year issues will not pose material problems with respect to such suppliers continuing to do business with the company on customary terms and conditions 
if such problems arise  the company has no practical alternatives to dealing with its existing suppliers  as the five largest suppliers dominate the music distribution industry 
the company is also dependent on normal telecommunications and banking systems and is relying upon the providers of such services not encountering material difficulties with regard to year compliance 
costs to address year issues 
the costs of the required upgrade of the company s inventory management and point of sale systems is expected to be approximately  per store currently the company operates stores or million 
these costs are expected to be incurred in the first and second quarter of the fiscal year ending march  but will  where appropriate  be capitalized and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable assets 
the company to date has incurred capitalized costs of  the company does not expect to incur material costs in internally reprogramming its other information systems software 
risks of year issues 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario with regard to year matters would relate to the effect that year issues would have upon music suppliers to the company 
if such suppliers were unable to continue to do business with the company on comparable terms as conducted in the past  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
the company s contingency plan 
the company has begun discussions with its suppliers to provide assurance of business continuation in the event of year issues  with a view to developing a plan for continuing the company s access to music product in the event of the suppliers year difficulties 
such a plan  however  has not yet been developed 
we cannot assure you that our efforts will prevent all consequences and there may be undetermined future costs due to business disruption that may be caused by suppliers or unforeseen circumstances
