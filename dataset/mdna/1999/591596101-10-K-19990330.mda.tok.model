item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since inception  the company has devoted significant resources to the development  deployment and commercialization of its wireless network products and services 
historically  a significant portion of the company s revenues have been derived primarily from the development contracts and sales of customer owned networks and related products  known as utilinet  to utility companies 
in recent years  the company has deployed a commercial wireless data network known as ricochet in various metropolitan areas of the united states 
the company currently provides ricochet commercial service in the san francisco bay area  the seattle and washington dc metropolitan areas  parts of los angeles  and in certain airports and corporate and university campuses 
ricochet s customers include individuals  corporations  educational institutions and federal  state and local governments 
as of february   there were approximately  ricochet network subscribers 
in  in conjunction with the company s acquisition of licensed spectrum in the ghz band in the fcc s wcs auctions  the company began the development of a higher speed service known as ricochet ricochet  an upgrade to ricochet  has demonstrated in company tests to provide the same service as ricochet  but at faster downstream speeds of up to kbps 
in conjunction with development of ricochet  the company has continued to pursue right of way and site agreements to enable ricochet deployment in various metropolitan areas 
the company plans to complete development of the ricochet system in and subsequently deploy it in various metropolitan areas in the united states 
the company has incurred cumulative net losses through december  of approximately million 
these losses resulted primarily from expenditures associated with the development  deployment and commercialization of the company s wireless network products and services 
the company expects to incur significant operating losses and to generate negative cash flow from operating activities during the next few years while it continues to develop and deploy its ricochet networks and build its customer base 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operating activities in a timely manner or at all 
the company s future success depends on completing the development of ricochet  acquiring new right of way and site agreements in metropolitan areas  and deploying ricochet in those areas 
completing the development of ricochet will require significant expenditures to engineer  install and test ricochet network equipment and modems prior to widespread deployment 
successful acquisition of right of way and site agreements will require expenditures to identify appropriate sites to locate network infrastructure  and negotiate and formalize agreements to allow for the company s use of such sites 
deployment of ricochet will require the company to incur significant costs to design  install and test network infrastructure in each metropolitan area 
a substantial portion of the development  site acquisition and deployment costs will be incurred before the realization of revenues from such areas 
any inability to execute  or delays in execution of  the development and deployment plans could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of the development and deployment of ricochet this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section of this form k entitled risk factors 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operational data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenues service revenues product revenues total revenues costs and expenses cost of service revenues provision for network replacement cost of product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative provision for overall wireless total costs and expenses loss from operations interest expense interest income  net net loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues consist of service and product revenues 
service revenues are derived from subscriber fees and modem rentals for ricochet and fees for utilinet customer support and are recognized ratably over the service period 
product revenues are derived from the sale of utilinet products and ricochet modems and are recognized upon shipment 
total revenues increased to million in from million in primarily due to increased shipments of ricochet modems 
ricochet product revenues totaled million in compared with million in product revenues in total increased to million in from million in a significant portion of utilinet product revenue was derived from southern california edison sce 
product revenues from sce accounted for and of total product revenues in and  respectively

cost of service revenues is primarily costs incurred to operate ricochet networks  the cost of providing customer support  certain excess capacity costs and manufacturing variances associated with manufacturing the company s network components and depreciation of modems rented to ricochet subscribers 
cost of service revenues also includes the cost to design the ricochet networks and maintain site agreements for the company s infrastructure in the metropolitan areas where commercial service is currently offered 
these costs are expensed as incurred due to the uncertainties regarding the realizability of these costs 
cost of service revenues were million in and million in in comparing cost of service revenues between and  an increase in costs incurred to add ricochet infrastructure and increase performance in commercial service areas was partially offset by reductions in inventory costs associated with a decrease in modems rented to customers in cost of service revenues is expected to increase significantly as a result of the continued operation of ricochet networks and planned future deployment of ricochet networks 
cost of service revenues is expected to be greater than service revenues for the foreseeable future 
cost of product revenues increased to million in from million in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues increased slightly to in from in the increase over is primarily due to a higher proportion of product revenues in derived from the sale of ricochet modems at prices less than their cost to manufacture 
provision for network replacement 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a one time charge of million to write down the carrying value of the ricochet network equipment that is currently in operation in three metropolitan areas 
this charge was recorded as a result of the company s plans to replace this equipment with ricochet equipment in the near future 
see property and equipment in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in approximately two thirds of the increase in was due to development of the high speed ricochet network technology and subscriber devices 
the increase was also due in part to an increase in costs incurred in to obtain right of way and site agreements in metropolitan areas where the company currently plans to offer service 
the company expects research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as the company continues the acquisition of right of way and site agreements as well as the development of ricochet selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to charges of approximately million in severance to employees terminated in the third and fourth quarters of partially offsetting this increase was a reduction of million in costs associated with the company s reduced ricochet sales and marketing efforts in compared with selling  general and administrative costs are expected to increase in the future as a result of the company s planned deployment of ricochet  which is currently in development 
interest income and expense

research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the net decrease in was due to reduced level of activity to obtain site agreements in metropolitan areas where ricochet deployment was planned 
this reduction was partially offset by an increase in development activities on ricochet and ricochet networks and subscriber devices 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to increased selling expense as a result of personnel increases and additional efforts to increase the number of ricochet subscribers 
general and administrative expenses also increased primarily as a result of personnel increases and professional fees associated with addressing regulatory matters  developing strategic relationships and pursuing financing arrangements

the company is currently in discussions with various potential partnership candidates 
management anticipates that such strategic partner will also provide financing for the company s future operations 
in the event that the company does not enter into a strategic partnership by may  management plans to reduce the level of operations of the company and consider other financing alternatives that will enable the company to continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available to the company or that the company will be able to successfully negotiate an agreement with a strategic partner 
the company has financed its operations and capital expenditures primarily through the public and private sale of equity and convertible debt securities

capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company expects that it will continue to have substantial capital requirements in connection with the ongoing development and planned deployment of ricochet the company also expects that  to the extent ricochet is deployed and marketed  increasingly significant capital expenditures will be required to procure ricochet modems 
the company expects to make significant capital expenditures in connection with the development  deployment and marketing of its wireless networks 
the company also expects that to the extent the company s subscriber base grows  significant capital expenditures will be required to procure ricochet and ricochet modems 
the amount and timing of expenditures  however  may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including market acceptance  availability of radios and modems  availability of sufficient financial  management  marketing and technical resources  and technological feasibility 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million

pepdata will contribute up to million in exchange for a ownership interest in metricom dc 
metricom dc will distribute available cash first to pepdata  until pepdata has received cumulative distributions equal to its capital contributions  and second to pepdata and metricom investments in proportion to their respective ownership interests 
as of december   pepdata had contributed million to the joint venture  million of which is reflected as a minority interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
year compliance 
many installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
as the year approaches  these code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from those beginning with dates 
as a result  in the next year  computer systems and or software products used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year yk requirements 
in the third quarter of  the company began a plan to remedy the potential yk problems 
the company is currently in various stages of assessment  testing and remediation of yk compliance  depending on the particular computer systems or software involved 
the company s business and financial systems have recently been upgraded to oracle  a current revision which has been certified by the vendor to be yk compliant 
the company is in the process of assessing its microcellular commercial data networks for yk compliance 
these networks are dependent upon third parties for telecommunications services and power 
if the company s providers of these services are not yk compliant  the usability of the company s microcellular commercial networks could be impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company intends to have its yk assessment  testing  remediation efforts and development of necessary contingency plans complete by the year to date  costs incurred to address yk compliance issues have not been material 
the company estimates that total costs to address yk compliance issues will be approximately  the total cost estimate is subject to change as the company progresses in the execution of its yk plan 
costs related to yk issues continue to be funded through operating cash flows 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete its yk assessment  testing  remediation efforts and development of necessary contingency plans by the year any failure to complete the yk assessment  testing  remediation efforts and development of necessary contingency plans prior to the year could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has begun communicating with its key suppliers to assess yk compliance 
there can be no assurance that the company s key suppliers have or will have information technology systems  non information technology systems and products that are yk compliant 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the company s customers have  or will have information technology systems  non information technology systems and products that are yk compliant 
any yk problem facing the company  its customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that the company s planned actions do not resolve the yk issues  the company is prepared to use backup systems  where possible  that do not rely on computers 
in other critical functions where computer systems are essential  the company intends to develop an alternative contingency plan in the coming months
