item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
forward looking statements when used within this document  the words expects  believes  anticipates  should  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and in section f of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause the actual results and performance of the company to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors include the impact of competition from new and existing self storage and commercial facilities which could impact rents and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  the company s ability to evaluate  finance  and integrate acquired and developed properties into the company s existing operations  the company s ability to effectively compete in the markets that it does business in  the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national  state  and local laws and regulations including  without limitation  those governing real estate investment trusts  the acceptance by consumers of the pickup and delivery concept  the impact of general economic conditions upon rental rates and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  and the availability of permanent capital at attractive rates 
overview the self storage industry is highly fragmented and is composed predominantly of numerous local and regional operators 
competition in the markets in which the company operates is significant and is increasing from additional development of self storage facilities in many markets which may negatively impact occupancy levels and rental rates at the company s self storage facilities 
however  the company believes it possesses several distinguishing characteristics which enable it to compete effectively with other owners and operators 
the company is the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in the united states with ownership interests as of december  in  self storage facilities containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
all of the company s facilities are operated under the public storage brand name  which the company believes is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry 
located in the major metropolitan markets of states  the company s self storage facilities are geographically diverse  giving it national recognition and prominence 
this concentration establishes the company as one of the most significant providers of storage space in each market in which it operates and enables it to use a variety of promotional activities  such as television and radio advertising as well as targeted discounting and referrals  which are generally not economically viable for its competitors 
in addition  the company believes that geographic diversity of the portfolio reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of revenue stability 
commencing in early  the company implemented a national telephone reservation system designed to provide added customer service 
customers calling either the company s toll free telephone referral system  store  or a self storage facility are directed to the national reservation system where a representative discusses with the customer space requirements  price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the company and its subsidiaries 
the national telephone reservation system was not fully operational for most of the company s facilities until the latter part of the fourth quarter of currently  the national telephone reservation system receives approximately  calls per month and has approximately representatives 
the company believes that the national telephone reservation system permits effective marketing for both self storage and portable self storage facilities and is primarily responsible for increasing occupancy levels and realized rental rates experienced at the self storage facilities during the past three years 
the company will continue to focus its growth strategies on i improving the operating performance of its existing portfolio of properties  ii increasing its ownership of self storage facilities through acquisitions of facilities owned by affiliates or third party owners  iii developing new self storage facilities  iv improving the operations of its portable self storage operations  and v to a limited extent through its existing ownership interest  participating in the growth of ps business parks  inc psb  a publicly traded real estate investment trust focusing on the ownership and operation of commercial properties 
on march   the company completed a merger transaction with storage trust realty storage trust  a publicly traded real estate investment trust 
in connection with the merger  the company acquired self storage properties located in states 
the company believes that the merger will benefit the shareholders of both companies by eliminating duplicative general and administrative expenses and creating economies of scale and cost efficiencies through greater critical mass 
in addition  the company believes that its national telephone reservation system will present an opportunity for increased revenues through higher occupancies of the properties acquired

on a diluted basis  net income per common share was per common share based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for  based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for and per common share based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for the increase in net income per share for compared to was principally the result of improved real estate operations  combined with lower operating losses generated by pspud s portable self storage business totaling  or per diluted common share 
the decrease in net income per share for compared to was principally the result of losses generated from pspud s portable self storage business which generated operating losses totaling  or per diluted common share and the effect of the special dividend  discussed below 
net income allocable to common shareholders and net income per common share for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by a special dividend totaling  paid on the company s series cc convertible preferred stock series cc during the first quarter of as a result of this special dividend  the company would not be required to pay another dividend with respect to this stock until the quarter ended march  during the second quarter of  the series cc stock converted into common stock of the company

since that time  the company through acquisition and development activities has increased the number of self storage facilities by facilities  facilities and facilities 
as a result of significant acquisitions of self storage facilities in each of the past three years  year over year comparisons as presented on the company s consolidated statements of income are not meaningful 
in order to enhance the year over year comparisons  the following table summarizes the operating results before depreciation of i the self storage facilities which includes the facilities owned at the end of as well as facilities which were acquired on january  that were reflected in the company s financial statements for the entire three years ended december  the consistent group and ii all other facilities for which operations were not reflected in the company s financial statement for the entire three years ended december  the other facilities self storage operations year ended december  year ended december  percentage percentage change change dollar amounts in thousands  except rents per square foot rental income consistent group     other facilities     cost of operations consistent group     other facilities     net operating income consistent group     other facilities     consistent group data gross margin weighted average occupancy realized annual rent per square foot

consistent group     other facilities     for the consistent group of facilities  year over year improvements in rental income of in and in are the result of increases in realized rent per square foot and weighted average occupancy levels  as reflected in the table above 
the company believes that the improvement in each of these areas is due to i the national telephone reservation system which was implemented during and the first part of  ii increased scheduled rental rates  and iii media advertising and promotional activities 
as indicated above  the company implemented a national telephone reservation system to provide added customer service 
customers calling either the company s toll free telephone referral system  store  or a local public storage facility  are directed to the national reservation system where a trained representative discusses with the customer space requirements  price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the company and its subsidiaries 
total cost of operations includes expenses with respect to the national telephone reservation center totaling  in   in  and  in in the second half of  the company began to increase its scheduled rents charged to new customers prior to promotional discounts and to existing tenants where warranted 
as a result  for fiscal  scheduled rents per square foot increased compared to in connection with the national telephone reservation system  the company experimented with pricing and promotional discounts designed to increase rental activity

due to the company s limited ownership interest and control of these entities  the company does not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes  and accounts for such investments using the equity method 
equity in earnings of real estate entities for the year ended december  consists of the company s pro rata share of the unconsolidated entities based upon the company s ownership interest for the period 
similar to the company  the unconsolidated entities generate substantially all of their income from their ownership of self storage facilities which are managed by the company

the increase in earnings compared to is principally the result of the deconsolidation of psb whereby the accounts of psb  effective april   were no longer consolidated with the company s and the company began to account for its investment in psb using the equity method 
this increase is partially offset by the impact of certain business combinations occurring in and whereby the company acquired a controlling interest in certain affiliated entities and began to include the accounts of such entities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
prior to the inclusion of these entities in the company s consolidated financial statements  the company used the equity method to report its share of the entities earnings 
likewise  the decrease in earnings compared to is principally the result of the company acquiring during a controlling interest in certain entities and beginning to include the accounts of such entities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
prior to the inclusion of these entities in the company s consolidated financial statements  the company used the equity method to report its share of these entities earnings 
psb is a publicly traded real estate investment trust organized by the company on january  during  the company and certain partnerships in which the company has a controlling interest contributed substantially all of their commercial properties to psb in exchange for equity interests 
at december   psb owned properties located in states 
psb also manages the commercial properties owned by the company and affiliated entities 
as of december   the company and certain partnerships in which the company has a controlling interest owned approximately of the equity interest of psb 
during  a significant portion of the company s self storage development activities have been conducted within the development joint venture  a partnership created in april between the company and an institutional investor to fund the development of approximately million of self storage facilities 
the development joint venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from the company and from the institutional investor 
the company s investment in the development joint venture was million at december  since inception through december   the development joint venture has developed and opened self storage facilities approximately  square feet and at december  had six facilities under development approximately  square feet 
generally the construction period takes nine to months followed by a to month fill up process until the newly constructed facility reaches a stabilized occupancy level of approximately 
for fiscal and  substantially all of the completed facilities were in the fill up process and had not reached a stabilized occupancy level 
the company expects that its earnings with respect to its investment in the development joint venture will continue to increase in as compared to as the existing properties continue to fill up and newly completed properties are opened for business 
portable self storage operations in august  pspud  a subsidiary of the company  made its initial entry into the portable self storage business through its acquisition of a single facility operator located in irvine  california 
at december   pspud operated facilities in states 
the facilities are located in major markets in which the company has significant market presence with respect to its traditional self storage facilities 
due to the start up nature of the business  pspud incurred operating losses totaling approximately million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  summarized as follows 
portable self storage year ended december  year ended december  dollar dollar change change dollar amounts in thousand rental and other income      cost of operations direct operating costs       marketing and advertising      depreciation      general and administrative      operating losses     the company believes that the quarterly losses from the pspud operations peaked during the third quarter of pspud s operating losses were approximately million for the third quarter of  million for the fourth quarter of  million for the first quarter of  million for the second quarter of  million for the third quarter of  and million in the fourth quarter of the company believes this trend of decreasing operating losses will continue with increases in pspud s revenues 
five of the facilities opened in were developed by and are owned by pspud  while the remaining facilities are operated in buildings which are leased from third parties 
included in direct operating cost is building lease expense of million  million and  during  and  respectively 
a typical facility generally has six employees a manager  a warehouseman  and truck drivers  two trucks  and a corresponding number of forklifts 
substantially all the equipment is leased 
direct operating costs principally includes payroll  facility and equipment truck and forklift lease expense 
pspud believes that marketing and advertising activities positively impact move in activity 
commencing in the third quarter of  pspud began to advertise the portable self storage product on television in selected markets 
television advertising was curtailed in the second half of customers are directed to call the national reservation system where representatives discuss the customers storage needs and are able to schedule delivery of containers to customers locations 
during  approximately million and million was incurred in television and yellow page advertising  respectively  compared to approximately million and million in television and yellow page advertising  respectively  incurred during marketing and advertising activities have not been consistently implemented in all markets 
during and  pspud incurred significant general and administrative costs related to recruiting and training personnel  equipment  computer software and professional fees in organizing this business 
pspud will continue to expend funds during in connection with these activities 
however  the amounts are expected to be less than in the company has not determined the number of new store openings in  however  the company expects that future openings will predominantly be in existing markets in which pspud currently operates 
by opening in existing markets  pspud will seek to gain benefits from economies of scale 
as of december   pspud is developing six facilities and has identified one additional site for development 
all of these development projects are located in existing markets with expected opening dates commencing during and will predominantly replace existing pspud facilities which are currently being leased from third parties 
until the pspud facilities are operating profitably  pspud s operations are expected to continue to adversely impact the company s earnings and cash flow 
pspud believes that its business is likely to be more successful in certain markets than in others 
there can be no assurances as to the level of pspud s expansion  level of gross rentals  level of move outs or profitability 
property management operations at december   the company managed self storage facilities owned by unconsolidated entities and owned by third parties pursuant to property management contracts 
the property management contracts generally provide for compensation equal to of gross revenues of the facilities managed 
under the supervision of the property owners  the company coordinates rental policies  rent collections  marketing activities  the purchase of equipment and supplies  maintenance activity  and the selection and engagement of vendors  suppliers and independent contractors 
in addition  the company assists and advises the property owners in establishing policies for the hire  discharge and supervision of employees for the operation of these facilities  including resident managers  assistant managers  relief managers and billing and maintenance personnel

accordingly  property management operations with respect to self storage facilities has continuously decreased during the three year period ended december  since the company has acquired in the past  and may continue to seek to acquire in the future  real estate facilities owned by the unconsolidated entities  the company s facility management income and related cost of operations should decrease in compared to the decrease in property management operations with respect to commercial properties for as compared to is due to the deconsolidation of psb  which eliminated commercial properties management fee income and cost of operations after april  other income and expense items interest and other income in an effort to attract a wider variety of customers  to further differentiate the company from its competition and to generate new sources of revenues  additional businesses are being developed through the company s subsidiaries that complement the company s self storage business 
these products include the sale of locks  boxes and packing supplies and the rental of trucks and other moving equipment through the implementation of a retail expansion program and truck rental program 
the net results of these businesses are presented along with interest and other income  as interest and other income

retail stores will be retrofitted to existing self storage facility rental offices or built in as part of the development of new self storage facilities  both in high traffic  high visibility locations 
the increases in revenues and cost of operations reflect the opening of additional stores  as well as increases at the company s existing stores 
interest and other income is primarily attributable to interest income on cash balances and interest income from mortgage notes receivable 
interest income from mortgage notes receivable was    in  and  respectively 
the company canceled mortgage notes receivable of approximately  in and  in in connection with the acquisition of the real estate facilities securing such notes 
the company also acquired notes receivable of  in from affiliated parties 
the other increases in interest income are primarily attributable to fluctuations in the level of invested cash balances  which are caused by the timing of investing equity offering proceeds in real estate assets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  in   in and  in these increases are principally due to the acquisition of additional real estate facilities in each period

the company capitalized interest expense of  in   in and  in in connection with the company s development activities 
interest expense before the capitalization of interest was  in   in and  in the decrease in interest expense in as compared to principally is due to the retirement of debt in of approximately million 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared to also includes the impact of the retirement of debt in of approximately million 
minority interest in income minority interest in income represents the income allocable to equity interests in consolidated entities which are not owned by the company 
since  the company has acquired portions of these equity interests through its acquisition of limited and general partnership interests in the consolidated entities 
these acquisitions have resulted in reductions to the minority interest in income from what it would otherwise have been in the absence of such acquisitions  and accordingly  have increased the company s share of the consolidated entities income 
however  offsetting the reduction in minority interest in and caused by the acquisition of additional equity interests are the inclusion of additional partnerships in the company s consolidated financial statements as well as improved property operations 
during and  the company acquired sufficient ownership interest and control in three and twelve partnerships  respectively  and commenced including the accounts of these partnerships in the company s consolidated financial statements which resulted in an increase in minority interest in income of approximately  in and  in minority interest for the year ended december  also reflects additional minority interests with respect to psb prior to april  in determining income allocable to the minority interest for  and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively  was allocated to the minority interest 
the changes in depreciation allocated to the minority interest were principally the result of the factors denoted above with respect to minority interest in income

realized rent per square foot as presented throughout this report represents the actual revenue earned per occupied square foot 
management believes this is a more relevant measure than the scheduled rental rates  since scheduled rates can be discounted through the use of promotions 
as indicated above  in early  the company implemented a national telephone reservation system designed to provide added customer service for all the self storage facilities under management by the company 
the company believes that the improved operating results  as indicated in the above table  in large part are due to the success of the national telephone reservation system 
however  the national telephone reservation system was not fully operational for most of the self storage facilities until the latter part of the fourth quarter of rental income for the same store facilities included promotional discounts totaling  in compared to  in and  in the significant increase in was principally due to experimentation with pricing and promotional discounts designed to increase rental activity  such promotional activities continued in the self storage facilities experience minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months 
the company believes that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activities during the summer

number of facilities liquidity and capital resources the company believes that its internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable it to meet its operating expenses  capital improvements  debt service requirements and distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
operating as a real estate investment trust reit  the company s ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted 
in order for the company to maintain its reit status  a substantial portion of its operating cash flow must be used to make distributions to its shareholders see reit status below 
however  despite the significant distribution requirements  the company has been able to retain a significant amount of its operating cash flow 
the following table summarizes the company s ability to pay the minority interests distributions  its dividends to the preferred shareholders and capital improvements to maintain the facilities through the use of cash provided by operating activities

the company intends to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facility from undistributed operating cash flow or  as market conditions permit and are determined to be advantageous  from the public or private placement of equity securities 
the company believes that its size and financial flexibility enables it to access capital for growth when appropriate 
the company s financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization  increasing net income  increasing cash flow from operations  and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common stock 
the company s credit ratings on its senior preferred stock by each of the three major credit agencies are baa by moody s and bbb by standard and poor s and duff phelps 
the company s portfolio of real estate facilities remains substantially unencumbered 
at december   the company had mortgage debt outstanding of million and had consolidated real estate facilities with a book value of billion 
the company has been reluctant to finance its acquisitions with debt and generally will only increase its mortgage borrowing through the assumption of pre existing debt on acquired real estate facilities 
over the past three years the company has funded substantially all of its acquisitions with permanent capital both common and preferred stock 
the company has elected to use preferred stock despite the fact that the dividend rates of its preferred stock exceeds current interest rates on conventional debt 
the company has chosen this method of financing for the following reasons i the company s perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirement  or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  ii preferred stock allows the company to leverage the common stock without the attendant interest rate or refinancing risks of debt  and iii like interest payments  dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to the company s reit distributions requirements  which have helped the company to maintain a low common stock dividend payout ratio and retain cash flow 
on january   the company issued million depositary shares each representing  of a share of its preferred stock  series k  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
on march   the company issued million depositary shares each representing  of a share of its preferred stock  series l  raising net proceeds of approximately million

distribution requirements the company s conservative distribution policy has been the principal reason for the company s ability to retain significant operating cash flows which have been used to make additional investments and reduce debt 
during  and  the company distributed to common shareholders approximately  and of its cash available from operations allocable to common shareholders  respectively 
during  the company paid dividends totaling  to the holders of the company s senior preferred stock   to the holders of the convertible preferred stock which converted to common stock during the third quarter of and  to the holders of common stock 
the company estimates the regular distribution requirements for fiscal with respect to senior preferred stock outstanding at december  to be approximately million 
with respect to the preferred stock issued in january and march  the annual distribution requirement is approximately million 
distributions with respect to the common stock will be determined based upon the company s reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the company s preferred shareholders 
the company expects to make a special cash distribution to common shareholders in assuming a continuation of its increasing level of taxable income 
capital improvement requirements during  the company has budgeted approximately million for capital improvements million for its self storage facilities and million for its commercial space 
the minority interests share of the budgeted capital improvements is approximately million 
the significant increase in capital improvements in for the self storage facilities as reflected in the table above is due primarily to the acquisition of new facilities in and debt service requirements the company does not believe it has any significant refinancing risks with respect to its mortgage debt  all of which is fixed rate 
at december   the company had total outstanding notes payable of approximately  see note to the consolidated financial statements for approximate principal maturities of such borrowings 
in connection with the march merger with storage trust  the company assumed million of notes payable 
approximately million in principal payments with respect to these notes are due in  with the remainder due after growth strategies during  the company intends to continue to expand its asset and capital base principally through the i acquisition of real estate assets and interests in real estate assets from both unaffiliated and affiliated parties through direct purchases  mergers  tender offers or other transactions  ii development of additional self storage facilities and iii the continued funding of the operations of pspud s portable self storage business 
in addition to wholly owned self storage facilities  the company operates  on behalf of approximately ownership entities  self storage facilities under the public storage name in which the company has a partial equity interest 
from time to time  some of these self storage facilities or interests in them are available for purchase  providing the company with a source of additional acquisition opportunities 
merger with storage trust on march   the company and storage trust  a public reit  completed a merger 
as a result of the merger  the company acquired self storage facilities located in states totaling approximately million net rentable square feet and  units

reit status the company believes that it has operated  and intends to continue to operate  in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  but no assurance can be given that it will at all times so qualify 
to the extent that the company continues to qualify as a reit  it will not be taxed  with certain limited exceptions  on the taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders  provided that at least of its taxable income is so distributed prior to filing of the company s tax return 
the company has satisfied the reit distribution requirement since the company expects to continue its present conservative distribution policy after the merger

funds from operations total funds from operations or ffo increased to  for the year ended compared to  in and  in ffo available to common shareholders after deducting preferred stock dividends increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  in and  in ffo means net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles before i gain loss on early extinguishment of debt  ii minority interest in income and iii gain loss on disposition of real estate  adjusted as follows i plus depreciation and amortization including the company s pro rata share of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated equity interests and amortization of assets acquired in a merger  including property management agreements and goodwill  and ii less ffo attributable to minority interest 
ffo is a supplemental performance measure for equity reits as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
the nareit definition does not specifically address the treatment of minority interest in the determination of ffo or the treatment of the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
in the case of the company  ffo represents amounts attributable to its shareholders after deducting amounts attributable to the minority interests and before deductions for the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
ffo is presented because management  as well as many industry analysts  consider ffo to be one measure of the performance of the company and it is used in establishing the terms of the class b common stock 
ffo does not take into consideration capital improvements  scheduled principal payments on debt  distributions and other obligations of the company 
accordingly  ffo is not a substitute for the company s cash flow or net income as discussed above as a measure of the company s liquidity or operating performance 
ffo is not comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define it exactly as the company defines it 
impact of year the company has completed an assessment of all of its hardware and software applications to identify susceptibility to what is commonly referred to as the yk issue whereby certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware with the yk issue that have date sensitive applications or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  resulting in miscalculations or system failure causing disruptions of operations 
the company has two phases in its process with respect to each of its systems  i assessment  whereby the company evaluates whether the system is yk compliant and identifies the plan of action with respect to remediating any yk issues identified and ii implementation  whereby the company completes the plan of action prepared in the assessment phase and verifies that yk compliance has been achieved 
many of the company s critical applications  relative to the direct management of properties  have recently been replaced and the company believes they are already year compliant 
the company has an implementation in process on the remaining critical applications  including its general ledger and related systems  that are believed to have yk issues 
the company expects the implementation to be complete by june contingency plans have been developed for use in case the company s implementations are not completed on a timely basis 
while the company presently believes that the impact of the yk issue on its systems can be mitigated  if the company s plan for ensuring year compliance and the related contingency plans were to fail  be insufficient  or not be implemented on a timely basis  company operations could be materially impacted 
certain of the company s other non computer related systems that may be impacted by the yk issue  such as security systems  are currently being evaluated  and the company expects the evaluation to be complete by june the company expects the implementation of any required solutions to be complete in advance of december  the company has not fully evaluated the impact of lack of year compliance on these systems  but has no reason to believe that lack of compliance would materially impact the company s operations 
the company exchanges electronic data with certain outside vendors in the banking and payroll processing areas 
the company has been advised by these vendors that their systems are or will be year compliant  but has requested a year compliance certification from these entities 
the company is not aware of any other vendors  suppliers  or other external agents with a yk issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year compliant  and there can be no assurance that the company has identified all such external agents 
the inability of external agents to complete their year compliance process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
the cost of the the company s year compliance activities which primarily consists of the costs of new systems is estimated at approximately million  of which approximately million has been incurred to date 
these costs are capitalized 
the company s year compliance efforts have not resulted in any significant deferrals in other information system projects 
the costs of the projects and the date on which the company expect to achieve year compliance are based upon management s best estimates  and were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
there can be no assurance that the company has identified all potential yk issues either within the company or at external agents 
in addition  the impact of the yk issue on governmental entities and utility providers and the resultant impact on the company  as well as disruptions in the general economy  may be material but cannot be reasonably determined or quantified
