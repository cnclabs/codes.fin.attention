liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   the company s operations generated million of cash compared with million in this increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects an increase in net income adjusted for noncash items  coupled with an increase in cash flows from changes in working capital 
the net increase in cash flows from changes in working capital is due to changes in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities partially offset by changes in inventories 
the payables and accruals change is primarily due to the timing of accounts payable payments  reduced payments of accrued compensation and increased accrued interest as a result of the transaction

the company s operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventories less accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease is primarily due to decreases in receivables and increases in payables and accruals

the increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are principally attributable to the timing of payments  accrued interest associated with the new debt resulting from the transaction and accruals recorded as part of the restructuring plan 
excluding the effect  if any  of future acquisitions and anticipated temporarily higher levels of inventory as the company stocks up in anticipation of higher demand related to year see below and as it completes the consolidation and relocation of certain of its logistical facilities in north america  the company s working capital requirements are not anticipated to increase in during the year ended december   the company used million for investing activities compared with million for the same period in the increase in cash used for investing activities is primarily attributable to acquisitions

the acquisitions were funded with cash flow from operations and million of net proceeds from new debt issued in november during the years ended december  and  the company made capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
the increase is due to the company s continued investments in logistical facilities in north america and global computer systems 
the decrease in proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment is due to the receipt of proceeds in from the sale of non core fixed assets 
capital expenditures in are expected to be at a similar level as as the company continues its consolidation and relocation of logistical facilities in north america 
the company s capital expenditures were primarily funded by the company s cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared with cash used in financing activities of million in this change is primarily due to an increase of million in net long term debt proceeds  including proceeds from a receivables securitization  attributable to the transaction and the november notes offering

environmental matters some of fisher s operations involve and have involved the handling  manufacture or use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws 
consequently  some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products of fisher  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses  and there can be no assurance that material damage will not occur or be discovered to have occurred or be determined to be material in the future 
the company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation relative to environmental protection matters 
the company s fair lawn and somerville  new jersey  facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders  issued pursuant to new jersey s environmental clean up and responsibility act ecra now called the industrial site recovery act isra  in connection with prior transfers of a controlling interest in the company  which require that certain remediation and other activities be undertaken at these sites 
the fair lawn facility is also part of a site listed on the superfund national priority list under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla 
fisher has also been notified that it is among the potentially responsible parties under cercla or similar state laws for the costs of investigating and or remediating contamination caused by hazardous materials at certain other sites 
the company s non superfund liabilities for environmental matters are principally related to compliance with ecra isra administrative consent orders and other environmental regulatory requirements such as the clean air act  the clean water act and other generally applicable requirements 
the potential costs related to environmental matters and the possible impact on future operations are difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup  the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility 
however  such costs could be material 
accruals for environmental liabilities are recorded  based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
estimates are established based upon reports prepared by environmental specialists  management s knowledge to date and its experience with the foregoing environmental matters  and include potential costs for investigation  remediation  operation and maintenance of cleanup sites and related capital expenditures 
accrued liabilities for environmental matters were million and million at december  and  respectively 
although these amounts do not include third party recoveries  certain sites may be subject to indemnification 
the company has accounted for environmental liabilities in accordance with accounting standards statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities  which addresses accounting and reporting for environmental remediation liabilities 
management believes this accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities expected to be incurred and  as a result  believes that the ultimate liability incurred with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements or results of operations 
however  future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations  changes in agency direction or enforcement policies  or changes in the conduct of fisher s operations  may give rise to additional compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
dividends on january   in connection with the transaction  the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement which restricts the company s ability to pay future dividends 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock at any time in the future 
financial condition at december   current assets decreased million from december   with reductions in accounts receivable of million offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily due to the sale of certain of the company s accounts receivables under a receivables securitization 
increased cash and cash equivalents at december  was a result of excess proceeds from the million notes issued in november  million of which was used for acquisitions in january current liabilities increased by million from december  primarily due to an increase of million in accounts payable and an increase of million in accrued and other current liabilities related to the timing of accounts payable payments  increased accrued interest relating to the additional indebtedness associated with the transaction and additional accruals recorded as part of the restructuring plan 
long term debt increased by million due to additional indebtedness as a result of the transaction and the notes issued in november stockholders equity at december  is a deficit of million as a result of the transaction 
european economic and monetary union the company conducts business in many of the countries which have agreed to join the european economic and monetary union the emu and  among other things  adopt a single currency called the euro 
on january   a three year transition period for the euro began and the conversion rates between the euro and the national currencies were fixed 
business enterprises have the option of switching to the single currency at any time prior to january  in connection with the upgrade of its management information systems  the company is incorporating the necessary changes to allow it to conduct business in euros and the national currencies during the transition period and entirely in euros thereafter 
the company is not able to estimate or segregate the costs relating to the conversion to the euro  but management does not believe that such costs are material 
the company does not anticipate that the conversion to the euro will have a material impact on its future results of operations

sop requires the capitalization of certain costs related to the development of software for internal use  and sop requires entities to expense  as incurred  costs associated with start up activities 
both standards will be effective for the company during fiscal year the company is essentially complying with these new standards and therefore does not expect their implementation in to have a material effect on the company s financial statements

the implementation of sop during did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
dependence on information systems  systems conversion  year issue the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of year information and readiness disclosure act 
the company s business is dependent in large part on its information systems 
these systems play an integral role in tracking product offerings including pricing and availability  processing and shipping more than  items per day  warehouse operations  purchasing from more than  vendors  inventory management  financial reporting  and other operational functions 
year issues exist when dates in computer systems are recorded using two digits rather than four and are then used for arithmetic operations  comparisons or sorting 
a two digit date recording may recognize a date using as rather than  which could cause the company s computer systems to perform inaccurate computations 
the company s year issues relate not only to its own systems but also to those of its customers and suppliers 
based upon assessments of each of the company s business units and the information systems supporting those operations  the company has begun implementing a program having the following major elements and a target completion date no later than december  first  the applications and other software supporting each business unit has been inventoried and analyzed and then planned for either a confirmation as year compliant  b upgrade to a year compliant version  c remediation to become year compliant or d replacement by other software which provides year compliance and other benefits 
for example  certain of the financial applications supporting the us distribution business have been replaced by oracle software  most of the remaining software including all remaining essential core software applications supporting the us distribution businesses have been remediated  tested by software professionals and end users  and implemented in regular business operations 
a limited number of other software applications are scheduled for upgrade or replacement prior to june  the primary methods of assuring year compliance for core business systems are a remediation for the us  canadian and us distribution systems  b replacement by new year and euro compliant software for the other european businesses  c upgrade to year versions for certain manufacturing businesses and d replacement by new year software for the remaining manufacturing businesses and overseas distribution businesses 
second  the company has initiated programs to assure year compliance for the equipment and software licenses that it currently markets to customers and to obtain and transmit to customers information about the equipment and software licenses which customers may have purchased in the past 
various units of the company are also assisting customers in developing plans to replace or upgrade any non compliant equipment or software  especially in laboratories  whether or not the products were acquired from the company 
third  the company has initiated programs to identify those suppliers whose own systems could lead to delays or interruptions in supply  either because of year non compliance or because of the necessity of extensive systems upgrades or replacements to avoid year issues 
the company is addressing such system changes by suppliers  where appropriate  by adjusting inventory levels and order lead times to ameliorate any delays or interruptions of product supply to the company s customers and is developing similar contingency plans  on a supplier specific basis to assure availability of products from suppliers making future systems changes or not providing adequate assurances of readiness to fill orders at the beginning of and in order to prevent or reduce any adverse effect on fill rates to the company s customers 
fourth  with particular regard to electronic data interchange edi  the company has developed plans to work with trading partners  including both suppliers and customers  to either work around the requirement for six digit date fields in the prior edi standards or to migrate  with the trading partner  to ansi version  which employs eight digit date fields 
the company has begun exchanging ansi version transactions with customers and has identified many of the customers who plan to migrate to version and many of the customers who plan to remain on earlier levels  windowing the transmitted six digit date at both ends and recognizing the correct year 
the company is scheduling test sessions with customers requesting either migration to version or testing of year compliance of such windowing 
the company will schedule similar testings of suppliers during the second and third quarters 
fifth  the company is implementing a project involving testing  with available test software  personal computers and associated software at various company locations  followed by upgrade or replacement where appropriate 
in addition  the company is implementing projects which include inventory  identification  assessment through vendor contacts  testing or both  planning  implementation replacement  repair or upgrade and testing of manufacturing equipment  environmental control equipment  elevators  security systems  telecommunications software  and equipment and similar purchased equipment  software  and systems 
while this portion of the overall program is targeted for completion by june   it is currently anticipated that a limited amount of this activity of certain of the company s sites would remain incomplete until a date no later than september contingency plans may be developed to work around these sites not fully compliant by june  with regard to financial cost  implementation of the program has resulted in and will continue to result in significant time expenditure by company personnel and outside software and equipment providers and some expenditures for equipment and software upgrades and replacements 
because many of these efforts have been designed to achieve other functional or systems improvements  in addition to year compliance  and are being carried out by operational personnel within each business unit  it is difficult to allocate particular funding levels solely to the year compliance activities 
in general  however  the company has spent million in operating expenses and million in capital expenditures on year activities to date and estimates incurring an additional million in operating expenses and million in capital expenditures to complete its year programs 
although the company believes that its present remediation and replacement programs will adequately address the year issues with respect to its internal systems  there can be no assurance that the company s belief is correct or that its present assessment is in fact accurate 
there can be no assurance that the remediation and replacement programs will be completed prior to the year or that if completed prior to the year that disruption will not occur 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s vendors  suppliers and the myriad of other financial  transportation  utility and other service providers will successfully resolve their own year issues in a manner which avoids significant impact to the company 
the company has received written assurances from many of its suppliers and other providers acknowledging the year issues and stating their present intention to be compliant 
the company has not received assurances from all of its suppliers and other providers and there is no guarantee that one or more key suppliers and other providers will not fail to become compliant in time to avoid a disruption to the company s business which  in spite of the company s contingency plans  would have a significant adverse impact on the company 
because of the complexity of the company s systems  the number of transactions processed and the number of third parties with whom the company interacts  certain failures of the company or its suppliers  vendors and other service providers to completely overcome the year issue could result in substantial and material impact on the company s business  operations and financial results 
the company s forecasted costs and timing for completion of its year programs are based on its best estimates  which in turn are based on numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability and cost of necessary personnel and other resources  third party modification plans  and other factors 
however  the company cannot be certain that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the preceding year readiness disclosure contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and the section a securities act of these forward looking statements represent the company s beliefs or expectations regarding future events 
when used in the year readiness disclosure  the words believes  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  the company s expectations as to when it will complete the modification and testing phases of its year project plan as well as its year contingency plans  its estimated cost of achieving year readiness  and the company s belief that its internal systems will be year compliant in a timely manner 
all forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results
