year compliance the company has assessed the year compliance problem and has determined that it has potential for exposure regarding year compliance in three areas of its internal and external business activities 
these areas include its own internal hardware  software systems  and the telecommunications systems which are utilized to process and provide the company s accounting  operational information  and communications  the vulnerability of the company to the failure of other companies to be year compliant  and the year compliance efforts of the environmental protection agency epa  a significant client of the company  on its daily tracking billing system 
the following discusses management s assessment and solutions of those risks and the steps that are being taken to minimize them 
internal hardware  software and telecommunications 
during the past months  the company has been and is replacing or adding new equipment to its inventory of network and systems computers 
the company has committed approximately  for this hardware software replacement  which has been financed with its cash resources and with lease financing 
the hardware includes the company s organization wide network systems and servers  telephone systems  and personal computer equipment 
the company will test year compliance on this new hardware software as it is accepted 
in addition  the company has contracted for the replacement of its organization wide accounting  costing  and management information computer software 
this new software will operate the company s accounting and operational information systems and will be functional for use by all of its regional locations 
the vendor has warranted that the software is year compliant 
customization of the software is scheduled  and the staff training will begin nd quarter it is estimated that the system will be installed and functional in the rd quarter the cost of this system is expected to be approximately  including software  hardware and implementation  and training expenses 
the primary purpose of acquiring this system is to provide improved functionality in the area of consolidated financial reporting  financial project controls  year compliance  timely cost capturing  and management reporting 
in addition  the company has reviewed its telecommunications systems  analyzed various options  and purchased a new central telecommunication system that will provide increased functionality associated with multiple office communication requirements 
the new system is year compliant  and installation is scheduled to be complete by june  the estimated costs associated with a new telecommunications system are  in addition to the above activities  the company is in the final process of completing a full inventory and assessment of its computer hardware  software  and equipment with embedded devices 
it is anticipated that this process will be completed by september management intends to identify any remaining remedial efforts that may be required to ensure its internal hardware and software systems are year complaint 
year compliance of other companies 
although the company expects its internal systems to be year compliant  the failure of any of its significant vendors or clients to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in certain normal business activities and operations 
to date  the company has received various inquires from its clients and significant vendors to provide information on year compliance or to inform the company of their year compliance 
the company has been responding to these requests and notices 
management is not aware of any claims by any client to provide remedial services under any warranty agreement stated or implied for systems it may have provided  nor is it aware of any system that may have been provided that may be in violation of any year compliance 
to the extent any such claims may be made  the company intends to address these issues on a case by case basis 
the year problem is not limited to computer hardware and software 
it can affect a multitude of other day to day business activities 
any type of equipment with a microchip that stores and processes dates can be affected 
the company is diligently identifying and addressing these issues so that its ability to conduct business as usual is not compromised as it moves into the st century 
the company is identifying mission critical business functions that rely upon date sensitive equipment  software  or hardware 
the company is requesting year verification in these areas by performance testing or certifications that use various types of testing for compliance  ie  century byte  hardware clock rollover  hardware clock leap year  bios rollover  bios leap year  power on rollover  and power on leap year 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  the company at this time is unable to completely determine if any adverse impact will be experienced by the company from other companies year failures 
epa year compliance 
the company has been working with the epa on their efforts to bring their daily tracking billing system rcms to year compliance 
the epa has been developing a windows based rcms  year compliant system to be issued to its contractors by july their efforts are currently in the design testing stage 
the company expects some amount of problems that are inherent to conforming to a new windows based system 
given the current assurances from the epa of their compliance  the company is only anticipating the normal conversion problems 
ie  dos based vs 
windows based interaction 
while the company may be vulnerable to other companies year compliance failures  the company is well positioned to minimize the yk impact 
the company believes that with the implementation of its new hardware  software  up grades to our office equipment  and completion of its assessment of vendors and clients  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations has been greatly reduced
