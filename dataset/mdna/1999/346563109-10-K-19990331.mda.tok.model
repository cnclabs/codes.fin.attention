the renewal rate was for this renewal rate is not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of the company s revenue base

year disclosure the company s state of readiness 
the company is implementing a broad based remediation effort to address the year problem 
this effort consists of the following three stages i survey and assess the company s operations for year compliance  ii execute the necessary software and hardware remedial changes  and iii test the remediation efforts to ensure year compliance 
there can be no assurance that the company s survey will identify all year problems in these areas or that the necessary corrective actions will be completed in a timely manner 
the first stage of the effort  a survey and assessment of the company s operations for year compliance  has been completed 
the company identified three areas of operations where the year problem could arise external product delivery systems 
this includes the company s three main platforms for electronic product delivery forrester s web site  ftp site  and lotus notes system 
internal information technology systems 
this includes the company s mis functions  customer service applications  and production systems 
third party vendors and service providers 
this includes a review of the company s third party vendor and service providers to establish their readiness for the year problem and assess any risks to the company 
material third party vendor and service providers include printers  mailing houses  and cd rom duplicators 
this survey included a review of the year compliance of the company s amsterdam office 
the company s external product delivery systems  internal information technology systems  and a number of third party vendors and service providers are also utilized by the amsterdam office 
the company continues to monitor and review non it facilities and third party vendors that are used exclusively by the european research center 
the company is currently implementing the second stage  executing the software and hardware changes necessary to remediate potential year problems identified in the survey 
the year compliance of the company s external product delivery systems and internal information technology systems ultimately depends upon the delivery of year compliant systems from the company s vendors 
the company is working closely with these vendors to ensure the timely delivery of year compliant systems 
the company s lotus notes system is fully year compliant  and the company has updated its web site and ftp site to bring these external delivery systems into year compliance 
the company s mis systems are fully compliant and vendor supplied upgrades for the company s customer service applications and production systems have been delivered and will be installed during the second quarter of the company s survey of non it facilities technology  which included a review of the elevator  hvac  security  and energy management systems  indicated that these systems are currently year compliant due to the absence of date sensitive microcontrollers 
during this second stage the company is also assessing its vulnerability to year problems of third party vendors and service providers 
the company relies on third party suppliers primarily to deliver printing services  mailing services  internet and web hosting services  and cd rom duplication 
the company intends to continuously identify and prioritize critical service providers and vendors and communicate with them about their plans and progress in addressing the year problem 
the final stage of the company s year efforts  the internal testing of all systems  is also currently underway 
in the fourth quarter of the company completed a successful test of its internal it systems and intends to continue to test these systems during the company anticipates that all testing for year compliance will be complete by mid the company s year risk 
based on the efforts described above  the company currently believes that its systems will be year compliant by mid however  there can be no assurance that all year problems will be successfully identified  or that the necessary corrective actions will be completed in a timely manner 
in addition  the survey has indicated that the company s compliance will require the delivery of upgrades by various vendors  and any failure to deliver these upgrades in a timely manner will adversely affect the company s readiness for the year problem 
the company relies on the internet for its external distribution systems  and any failure of the internet due to year issues could adversely affect the company 
the company s contingency plans 
the company is designing a contingency plan for year problems 
this contingency plan will be in place by mid and will be designed to mitigate the effects of third parties failures to remediate their year issues and for unexpected failures in its own systems 
pursuant to the contingency plan  the company has made arrangements for some alternate suppliers  such as internet service providers  and will continue to identify potential alternate suppliers 
if it becomes necessary for the company to take these corrective actions  it is uncertain whether this would result in significant interruptions in service or delays in business operations or whether it would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flow 
costs of year remediation 
as of december   the company has not incurred material costs related to the year problem 
in the future  the company may incur small incremental costs in connection with the upgrades of its external delivery systems and internal information technology systems 
the company has not deferred other information technology projects due to year expenses and does not expect to defer such projects in the future 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
need to attract and retain professional staff 
the company s future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of its senior management team  research analysts  and experienced sales personnel 
accordingly  future operating results will be largely dependent upon the company s ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional qualified personnel from a limited pool of qualified candidates 
the company experiences intense competition in hiring and retaining professional personnel from  among others  producers of information technology products  other research firms  management consulting firms  print and electronic publishing companies  and financial services companies 
many of these firms have substantially greater financial resources than the company to attract and compensate qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of key management and professional personnel or the inability to attract such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
management of growth 
the company s growth has placed significant demands on its management and other resources 
the company s revenues increased approximately to million in from million in the company s staff increased from full time employees on december  to full time employees on december  the company s ability to manage growth  if any  effectively will require it to continue to develop and improve its operational  financial  and other internal systems  as well as its business development capabilities  and to train  motivate  and manage its employees 
in addition  the company may acquire complementary businesses  products  or technologies  although it currently has no commitments or agreements to do so 
the company s management has limited experience integrating acquisitions 
if the company is unable to manage its growth effectively  such inability could have a material adverse effect on the quality of the company s products and services  its ability to retain key personnel and its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
variability of quarterly operating results  possible volatility of stock price 
the company s revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors including the timing and size of new and renewal memberships from clients  the timing of revenue generating events sponsored by the company  the utilization of its advisory services  the introduction and marketing of new products and services by the company and its competitors  the hiring and training of new analysts and sales personnel  changes in demand for the company s research  and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company s operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could have a material adverse effect on the market price for the company s common stock 
factors such as announcements of new services or offices or strategic alliances by the company or its competitors  as well as market conditions in the information technology services industry  may have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock 
the market price for the company s common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general 
dependence on renewals of membership based research services 
the company s success depends in part upon renewals of memberships for its core research products 
approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively  were derived from the company s membership based core research products 
a significant decline in renewal rates for the company s core research products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees 
the loss of key personnel  in particular george f 
colony  the company s founder and chairman of the board of directors  president  and chief executive officer  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in october  the company entered into a registration rights and non competition agreement with mr 
colony  which provides that if mr 
colony s employment with the company is terminated he will not compete with the company for the one year period following his termination 
risks associated with anticipating market trends 
the company s success depends in part upon its ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt its core research to meet the changing information needs of the company s clients 
the technology sectors that the company analyzes undergo frequent and often dramatic changes  including the introduction of new products and obsolescence of others  shifting strategies and market positions of major industry participants  paradigm shifts with respect to system architectures  and changing objectives and expectations of users of technology 
the environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to the company s ability to provide its clients with current and timely analysis  strategies  and advice on issues of importance to them 
meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources  and any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments  technologies  and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
new products and services 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to offer new products and services that successfully gain market acceptance by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors  changes in client requirements  and changes in the technology industry 
the process of internally researching  developing  launching  and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service  or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service  is inherently risky and costly 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to introduce new  or assimilate acquired  products or services will be successful 
competition 
the company competes in the market for research products and services with other independent providers of similar services 
several of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  information gathering  and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  the company s indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of the company s current and prospective clients  as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies  survey based general market research firms  and general business consulting firms 
the company s indirect competitors may choose to compete directly against the company in the future 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into the company s market and new competitors could readily seek to compete against the company in one or more market segments addressed by the company s products and services 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate obligations  federal agency obligations  state and municipal bonds  and us treasury notes with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
the following table provides information about the company s investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in us dollars in thousands  except interest rates are fair value at fy and december  fy fy thereafter cash equivalents   weighted average interest rate investments    weighted average interest rate total portfolio    weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically  the company s primary exposures have been related to non dollar denominated operating expenses in europe  canada  and asia where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union has taken place in the company s fiscal year the company has not determined what impact  if any  the euro will have on foreign exchange exposure 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in the euro if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the assets and liabilities related to non dollar denominated currencies was approximately million
