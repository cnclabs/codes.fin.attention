this resulted in a decrease in revenues that otherwise would have been recognized in the fourth quarter since only a portion of the revenues related to annual lease agreements was recognized 
the revenue reduction was  compared to the amount of revenue that would have been recognized under sop this revenue will be recognized ratably over primarily the first three quarters of the effect of this change for the fourth quarter of and subsequent periods is outlined in the following table cy q cy q cy q cy q cy q beyond revenues the americas       europe       asia pacific       consolidated       future quarters will also reflect the deferral of revenue associated with non cancelable and prepaid annual lease arrangements entered into in those quarters under sop because sop does not permit restatements of prior periods and because there are annual license renewals in every month of the year  the entire effect of this change in revenue recognition will not be fully recognized in reported revenue on a quarterly basis until the fourth quarter of the year will be the first reported year that will reflect a full twelve months of revenue under this method of revenue recognition for annual licenses

 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
capitalized software costs are then amortized over a period of time expected useful life that is estimated to equate to the term during which meaningful revenue from the related product is expected to be recognized 
previously capitalized product development costs and projected revenues are reviewed quarterly to determine if any impairment in value has occurred that would require an adjustment in the carrying value or change in expected useful lives under the guidelines established in sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company recognizes impairment losses on long lived assets when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts

on february  the company announced a new organizational structure following a re evaluation of its business strategy 
the company will now emphasize the expansion of the software business into new markets and value added integration services 
the new structure is designed to better serve the existing customer base and at the same time address expanding growth opportunities 
the reorganization plan provides for a reduction in the company s worldwide workforce which is approximately positions  and the consolidation of field offices 
these changes will result in pre tax charges of approximately  in the first quarter of the charges consist of severance costs of  costs related to facility consolidations of  and other charges of  the company anticipates these charges will provide a reduction in its annual operating costs

acquisition in late december  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of knowledge revolution kr 
kr is the world s leading developer and distributor of d and d motion simulation software for design engineers and analysts 
this acquisition has allowed the company to increase its product offerings to deliver tools and expertise to the mid range and desktop markets 
the company acquired kr for approximately  in cash and the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the total purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities of kr based on their approximate fair market value 
a significant portion of the purchase price was identified in an independent appraisal  using proven valuation procedures and techniques  as intangible assets 
the appraisal of the acquired business included  of purchased in process research and development ipr d 
this acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  it was written off at the time of the acquisition 
the remaining purchase price was allocated as follows  to net tangible assets   to developed technology   to their value added reseller network   to their assembled work force  and  to goodwill 
goodwill and identified intangibles are being amortized between three and ten years 
on the date of its acquisition  kr s technology was classified between core or developed technology and ipr d 
four kr products  one released and the others under development  were identified and their reliance on the developed technology and ipr d was determined 
the reliance on ipr d ranged from to on these products 
ipr d was further segmented into classifications of completed and to be completed based on three criteria the estimated time required to complete the development  the estimated cost to complete and the complexity involved in overcoming technological obstacles that must be resolved during development 
the completion of development at the time of acquisition ranged from to 
management estimates the cost to complete this development effort to be approximately  and the release of these products during the second and third quarters of these r d valuations represent the five year after tax cash flow of this technology using a discount rate of for developed technology and for ipr d respectively 
the discount rate is based upon the acquiring company s weighted average cost of capital wacc of 
this wacc was derived by considering various factors to quantify the risk above a risk free rate of return of approximately 
the discount rate selected for the ipr d was determined to be significantly higher than the wacc due to the fact that the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition 
in valuing both the developed technology and ipr d  the initial focus was on the revenue contribution generated by each of the products 
revenue estimates were based on the following aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  individual product revenues  growth rates for related products  anticipated product development and introduction schedules  product sales cycles and the estimated useful life of a product s underlying technology 
the aggregate product revenue amounts were estimated and segregated between the developed technology and ipr d 
operating expenses were deducted from the revenue estimates to arrive at operating income 
operating expenses included cost of revenue  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses but no non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization 
certain adjustments were made to operating income to derive the after tax cash flow 
these adjustments included the calculation of an applicable tax expense and an appropriate charge for the use of contributory assets necessary to generate revenue and operating income associated with the subject intangible assets 
management believes that the company is positioned to complete development of these kr products and expand the company s market share in the growing mid range and desktop markets 
however  there is risk associated with the completion  marketing and ultimate sale of these products 
there is no assurance that any product will meet with either technological or commercial success 
the substantial delay or outright failure of these products could adversely impact the company s financial condition

operating pattern the change in year end to december and the adoption of sop in the fourth quarter of both have a significant effect on the operating pattern of the company 
the month of january has historically been the largest revenue month of the year with the highest volume of renewals 
under sop the company will be recognizing its software lease revenue on a monthly basis over the term of the licenses 
this change will reduce the volatility of the revenue stream for interim accounting periods of the company 
in addition  because the sop does not permit restatements of prior periods and because there are annual license renewals in every month of the year  the entire effect of this change in revenue recognition will not be fully recognized in reported revenue on a quarterly basis until the fourth quarter of the year will be the first reported year that will reflect a full twelve months of revenue under this method of revenue recognition for annual licenses 
the company anticipates that revenue for will also be affected by having a full year of operations of the working knowledge division  which was created in december effective january  the company has changed the estimated useful life of its capitalized software assets from three and four years to two and three years 
the company has always estimated the expected life of these assets based on the release cycle of its products 
the company believes that as software production cycles decrease  amortization periods should also decrease in order to coincide with a version s revenue stream 
the company is making this change prospectively 
due to the continual change in the product development process there can be no assurance that the level of development capitalized in future periods will be comparable to current capitalized levels

the exercise price is equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of issuance of the warrants 
the warrants are non transferable  have a five year term and become exercisable two years after the date of issuance 
the arrangement also provides kstc with marketing rights to a specific technology being developed 
for the year ended december   the company has recorded  of service revenue related to the development effort and marketing rights provided under the arrangement and issued warrants to kstc valued at  to purchase  shares of the company s common stock

the company sold its electromagnetic business unit ebu to ansoft corporation for  in july  which did not result in a material effect on earnings 
the sale of the unit did not materially affect net income compared to prior years because of the relatively small size compared to the company s overall operations 
however  the sale did significantly improve both the company s cash position and its cash used in investing activities  compared to prior years 
during the middle of  the company eliminated its quarterly dividend in order to reinvest more of its earnings into its operations 
dividend payments were made on the company s common stock in the aggregate amounts of  in the year ended december  the company does not plan to reinstate the payment of dividends in the foreseeable future 
impact of year the company has determined that the purchased software applications and internally developed software applications that are used internally are year compliant 
the company has initiated formal communications with all its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s internal applications and other interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company has assessed that potential problems associated with embedded technology do not represent a significant area of risk relative to year readiness due to the nature of company s operations and its use of non information technology systems ie embedded technology such as microcontrollers 
the company s operations do not include capital intensive equipment with embedded microcontrollers 
however  there is no guarantee that other systems or equipment of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company expects to complete its contingency planning for the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios by august depending on the systems affected  these plans could include accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  short to medium term use of back up equipment and software  increased work hours for company personnel or use of contract personnel to correct on an accelerated schedule any year issues which arise or to provide manual workarounds for information systems or other similar approaches 
if the company is required to implement any of these contingency plans  such plans could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
during  the company made significant progress in its year compliance testing on the software that is sold to customers 
the tests certify that our currently supported products will operate and correctly process dates over a supported date range which extends from before january  and encompasses a time period reasonably suitable for the intended use of the product 
substantially all of the company s products licensed after january  are year compliant 
compliance letters for each product containing year compliance details are posted at the company s web site at url http www 
mscsoftware 
com 
the company s policy  in accordance with gaap  is to expense as incurred the cost of maintenance and modification to existing systems  and to capitalize the cost of any new software or hardware and amortize that cost over the assets estimated useful lives 
the incremental cost of the modifications to achieve compliance was immaterial to operating results 
finally  the company is also subject to external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as utility or manufacturing company year compliance failures and related service and production interruptions 
furthermore  the purchasing patterns of analysts and designers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct their current systems for year compliance 
the company does not currently have any information about the year status of its customers 
however  these expenditures may result in constant or reduced revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
based on the actions taken to date as discussed above  the company is reasonably certain that it has or will identify all year issues that could materially adversely affect its business and operations 
the cost of this study has been immaterial

the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between january  and january  during this transition period  public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis whereby recipients must accept euros or the legacy currency as offered by the payer 
a currency translation process known as triangulation dictates how legacy currencies are converted to the euro and other legacy currencies 
beginning january   the participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills and coins and replace the legacy currencies as legal tender in cash transactions by july  because the company conducts a significant portion of its business in europe through its wholly owned german subsidiary  its business and operations will be affected by the euro conversion 
management is addressing the euro conversion  but its impact on future operating results is uncertain 
management expects the conversion to decrease pressure for pricing in legacy currencies in the participating countries 
however  the company also does business in many non participating countries including the united kingdom 
this could lead to an increase in cross border competition  which could affect its allocation of resources within europe  and eventually the company s labor cost 
the company is implementing an upgrade to its management information system which includes the ability to simultaneously record transactions in euros  perform the prescribed currency conversion computations and convert legacy currency amounts to euro 
the impact of the conversion on the company s currency risk and taxable income is not expected to be significant 
in regard to contracts denominated in legacy currencies  management has not identified any third party or customer contracts whose performance might be considered unenforceable due to a currency substitution 
software lease and maintenance contracts are typically renewed on an annual basis 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company 
inflation inflation in recent years has not had a significant effect on the company s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes 
foreign currency risk as discussed above  international revenues are of the company s total revenues 
international sales are made mostly from the company s two foreign sales subsidiaries in germany and japan and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which cash from sales of the company s foreign subsidiaries costs are transferred back to the united states 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in was not material 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated repayments of its inter company debt with its foreign subsidiaries 
the forward exchange contracts do not qualify as a hedge for financial reporting purposes and  accordingly  unrealized gains or losses based on the current forward foreign exchange rates are reflected directly in income 
at december   the company had two forward exchange contracts maturing in january and february to exchange a total of  deutsche marks for us dollars in the amount of approximately  at december   the company had two forward exchange contracts maturing in january and february to exchange a total of  deutsche marks for us dollars in the amount of approximately  the unrealized gains were immaterial at december  and interest rate risk the company s exposure to market rate risks for changes in interest rates relate to both the company s investment portfolio and its outstanding borrowings under its line of credit 
refer to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash primarily in debt instruments of us municipalities and other high quality issuers and  by policy  limits amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
the following table is a summary of available for sale securities fair market value fair market value rate rate of december  of return december  return dollars in thousands municipal securities   other debt securities investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the company s line of credit is available at the variable interest rate of prime  with an option to fix the rate at libor plus for a period of days 
as of december   the company s balance was
