management believes that the company has adequate resources and liquidity to meet its borrowing obligations  fund all required capital expenditures  and pursue its business strategy for existing operations through the end of this fiscal year 
however  the company will require additional funding in order to pursue significant acquisition opportunities 
future acquisitions may be financed by bank borrowings  public offerings  or private placements of equity or debt securities  or a combination of the foregoing 
such financings may require the consent of the company s existing lenders 
subsequent event on june   the company entered into an amendment and waiver to the credit agreement the amendment 
in general  the amendment increases the interest rates paid by the company  shortens the maturities of the term loans  grants certain warrants to the lenders  creates a new borrowing base reserve and revises the financial covenants  all as described in more detail below 
the amendment provides for the following changes to the revolver  tranche a term loan and tranche b term loan

in addition  the company is now required to meet a quarterly senior fixed charge ratio and quarterly targets of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
seasonality the sale of products by the company is seasonal 
sales generally increase during the warmer months beginning in april and peak in the months of june  july  and august 
inflation the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the sales or operating results of the company 
however  inflation in the future could affect the company s operating costs 
price changes from suppliers have historically been consistent with inflation and have had little impact on the company s profitability 
the company has been able to pass supplier price increases to its customers or  in a case where the company meets resistance from its customers on a price increase  the company has been successful in working with certain suppliers to reduce acquisition costs in order to maintain a reasonable margin on its sales 
year the company utilizes computer systems and software that are affected by the year issue 
many computer programs were originally designed to utilize two digits instead of four to define the applicable year 
as a result  a computer program might recognize a date using as the year rather than which could cause system failures or miscalculations 
the company s operations could be adversely affected by year issues 
the company has separated its year project into four phases 
during phase i  millennium impact analysis  the company reviewed all its business segments for year issues 
the company categorized all of its hardware  software  and other equipment as either compliant  non compliant  or as requiring research 
the company also contacted its largest customers and most critical suppliers 
to date  of such customers and of the critical suppliers have responded 
the company is in the process of contacting the non respondents to determine the level of risk 
as a part of phase ii  project tactical planning  a project budget and work plan for achieving year compliance were developed 
the majority of the work plan was devoted to replacing the non compliant supply chain and financial management systems 
replacing non compliant point of sale pos systems and telephone systems was also identified as a major task 
currently  the company is in the midst of phase iii  conversion and system training 
since the company has successfully implemented its new enterprise software  it is now compliant 
to be fully compliant  the company must replace its telephone systems and pos equipment in some of its branches 
since this process is approximately complete  the company believes that it will complete this phase by september in the final phase  phase iv  year simulation and deployment  the company will perform simulation testing to confirm that all systems are compliant 
during this phase  the company will age its database and model its business applications as if it were january  the company intends to conduct this testing in september the company has completed the replacement and upgrade of its supply chain and financial management systems and software that enable it to respond more efficiently to the needs of its customers 
the company believes that the new system is year compliant 
the company has also targeted non compliant pos hardware and software for replacement 
for the company s operations to continue uninterrupted  certain key third parties  such as banks  customers  and vendors  must resolve all the year issues affecting them 
previously  the company mailed surveys to these key third parties 
as of this date  all responses have indicated that these parties will be year compliant 
the company will continue to solicit surveys from unresponsive parties  as well as continue to monitor the status of key third parties 
since the company chose to replace its main operating system primarily to improve customer service  the costs associated with this implementation are not considered year related costs 
the company has budgeted  for the replacement and upgrading of pos hardware and software 
to date  the company has expended approximately  for this portion of the project 
the company anticipates spending an additional  to complete the project 
the company has budgeted an additional  to replace non compliant telephone systems  security systems  and office equipment 
the company anticipates these replacements will be completed by november the costs for the replacement of these systems will be funded through the working capital facility 
the company is expecting to capitalize these costs as they are incurred 
the company has not materially deferred any other projects in order to achieve year compliance 
in the worst case scenario  several of the company s branches could be without basic utility services for an extended period of time 
the company could also suffer unanticipated hardware or software failures 
as a result  the company may not be able to timely provide reliable data to management 
the company is also concerned that a number of its key suppliers might not be in compliance with year requirements as of january  if any one of the financial institutions with whom the company transacts business was non compliant  the company s ability to borrow funds  process customer receipts and vendor payments  and successfully complete other transactions may be adversely affected 
the company is in the process of developing a contingency plan that would allow it to continue its operations even if such a disruption to vital services were to occur although the specifics of such plan are not expected to be finalized until the fall of in particular  the company is in the process of developing procedures to process transactions manually in the event of the loss of power at any of its locations 
as other potential risk areas become apparent  the company intends to develop alternative solutions 
however  if the company  its vendors  or its customers  are unable to resolve their significant year issues  it could result in a material financial risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates due to the company s variable rate debt 
based on the company s debt profile at february   a increase in market interest rates would increase interest expense and decrease income before income taxes by  these amounts were determined by calculating the effect of the hypothetical interest rate on the company s floating debt rate  after giving consideration to the company s interest rate swap agreements and other risk management instruments 
these amounts do not include the effects of certain potential results of increased interest rates  such as a reduced level of overall economic activity or other actions management may take to mitigate this risk 
furthermore  this sensitivity analysis does not assume changes in the company s financial structure that could occur if interest rates were higher
