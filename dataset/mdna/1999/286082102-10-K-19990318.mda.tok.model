item legal proceedings on december   a shareholder class action lawsuit  entitled steele  et al 
v 
electronics for imaging  inc  et al  no 
cv  was filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors in the california superior court  san mateo county the san mateo superior court 
five virtually identical class action complaints were subsequently filed in the san mateo superior court 
on december   a putative shareholder class action entitled smith v 
electronics for imaging  inc  et al  no 
c was filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the state court class actions allege that the company made false and misleading statements concerning its business during a putative class period of april  through december  and allege violations of california corporations code sections and and civil code sections and the federal court class action complaint makes the same factual allegations  but alleges violations of certain united states federal securities laws 
the complaints do not specify the damages sought 
the company believes that these lawsuits are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously  but there can be no assurance that if damages are ultimately awarded against the company  the litigation will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company is involved from time to time in litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of its business 
the company believes that the ultimate resolution of such claims will not materially affect the company s business or financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
all assumptions  anticipations  expectations and forecasts con tained herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
for a discussion of the factors that could impact the company s results  readers are referred to the section below entitled factors that could adversely affect performance 
results of operations the following tables set forth items in the company s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenue for  and  and the year to year percentage change from over and from over  respectively 
these operating results are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
years ended december  change over over revenue cost of revenue gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative in process research and development n a n a operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenue revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in  which yielded a increase in as compared to and a increase in as compared to the corresponding unit volume increased by in over and by in over the increase in revenue was primarily due to significant increases in unit volumes  positive market acceptance of new product introductions and the impact of new customers  partially offset by price reductions on older product lines early in the year in anticipation of new product introductions 
the company s revenue for was principally derived from three major categories 
the first category was made up of stand alone servers which connect digital color copiers with computer networks 
this category includes the fiery xj  x and zx products and accounted for a majority of the company s revenue prior to the second category was made up of embedded desktop controllers  bundled color solutions and chipsets primarily for the office market 
the third category is made up of controllers for digital black and white products 
the following is a break down of categories by revenue  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total 
also shown is volume as a percentage of total units shipped 
revenue revenue revenue in thousands revenue stand alone servers connecting to digital color copiers    embedded desktop controllers  bundled color solutions chipset solutions    controllers for digital black and white solutions  spares  licensing other misc 
sources    total revenue    volume volume volume volume stand alone servers connecting to digital color copiers embedded desktop controllers  bundled color solutions chipset solutions controllers for digital black and white solutions spares  licensing other misc 
sources total volume growth in primarily took place in the category of embedded desktop controllers  bundled color solutions and chipset solutions 
this reflects the bifurcation of the market moving from mid range to high end and desktop products 
the desktop product category made up of total revenue and of total unit volume in whereas  it made up of total revenue and of total unit volume in and of total revenue and of total unit volume in these products  except for the chipset solutions  are generally characterized by much higher unit volumes but lower unit prices and associated margins than the company has experienced in its more traditional stand alone server line of products 
the chipset solutions can be characterized by lower unit prices and higher per unit margins compared to the traditional stand alone server line of products 
the company anticipates further growth in the desktop category as a percentage of total revenue 
to the extent this category does not grow over time in absolute terms  or if the company is not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the company believes that stand alone server products have not experienced year over year revenue growth in due largely to price reductions on the company s older generations of product 
the company believes these products are being effectively replaced by newer products as its oem customers continue to qualify the new products and begin to order in increasing volumes 
in addition  low end products which previously shipped as stand alone products have begun to ship in as embedded products 
there can be no assurance that the new products for will be qualified by all the oems  or that they will successfully compete  or be accepted by the market  or otherwise be able to effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from the older products 
the company also believes that in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for all of its products may affect revenues in the future 
the company has made and may in the future make price reductions for its products 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for the company s products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions may have an adverse impact on the company s revenues and profits 
if the company is not able to compensate for lower gross margins that may result from price reductions with an increased volume of sales  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if the company s revenue in the future depends more upon sales of products with relatively lower gross margins excluding chipset solutions than the company obtained in such as embedded controllers for printers  embedded controllers for color and black and white copiers  and stand alone controllers for black and white copiers  results of operations may be adversely affected 
shipments by geographic area for the years ended  and were as follows years ended december  change over over north america europe japan rest of world in the middle of the second quarter of  one of the company s major customers began having its products for the european market shipped directly to europe rather than through the united states 
the company does not know the dollar amount of the corresponding shipments that went through north america to europe for the periods prior to the second quarter of therefore shipments to north america in and early are slightly overstated and shipments that went to europe in the same period are slightly understated when compared to consequently the above indicated revenue information and the increases and decreases from over and from over for north america and europe should be read with caution 
whereas shipments to north america  europe and japan increased in compared to and in compared to  the rest of world region experienced a decrease in over although export sales to japan increased sequentially  the future results might be impaired by the economic turmoil in that region 
the rest of world is predominantly represented by the southeast asian region  and the decrease in export sales in compared to is a reflection of the challenging economic situation in that region 
although such conditions are difficult to predict  the company does not assume that there will be a significant improvement in economic conditions in asia in  and limited demand from asia may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
as shipments to some of the company s oem partners are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations which in turn sell through to other locations  the company believes that export sales of its products into each region may differ from what is reported  though accurate data is difficult to obtain 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue 
substantially all of the revenue for the last three years was attributable to sales of products through the company s oem channels with such partners as canon  epson  fuji xerox  ibm  hewlett packard  kodak danka business systems  konica  minolta  oce  ricoh  sharp  xerox and others 
during  the company has continued to work on both increasing the number of oem partners  and expanding the size of existing relationships with oem partners 
the company relied on three oem customers  canon  xerox and ricoh in aggregate for  and of it s revenue for  and  respectively 
in the event that any of these oem relationships are scaled back or discontinued  the company may experience a significant negative impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the company s relationships with these oem partners will continue 
on october   the company announced that it has provided hewlett packard with embedded fiery xe technology for the new hp color laserjet printer which is hp s first a tabloid color laser printer for the corporate workgroup market 
hewlett packard is the market leader among computer printer manufacturers for the desktop market 
the project calls for the company to provide chipsets and embedded software to hp which will have a lower per unit revenue but a much higher per unit margin as a percentage of revenues than the company s traditional products have had 
the hp chipset solution is classified in the embedded  desktop and bundled category 
the company continues to work on the development of products utilizing both the fiery architecture and other products and intends to continue to introduce new generations of fiery products and other new product lines in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of new  current or future products will be successful 
it is also possible that revenues in the future may be affected if individuals with responsibility for purchasing the company s fiery products  such as information technology professionals  choose to devote available discretionary resources to other perceived needs  such as technology expenses associated with year preparation 
at this time  the company cannot determine how much impact  if any  this factor may have 
cost of revenue historically  a majority of the company s cost of revenue has been attributable to the sale of fiery color servers 
fiery color servers as well as embedded desktop controllers and digital black and white products are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
the company sources directly processors  memory  certain asics  and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which the company licenses from adobe systems  inc gross margins the company s gross margin was  and for  and respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in from was due to a combination of factors  including a higher mix of low end products with relatively lower margins and a different mix of oem partners purchasing a different mix of products during as compared to the company also initiated price reductions on older products as of january  in light of pending introductions of newer generations of products 
the company expects that sales of products with relatively lower margins may further increase as a percentage of revenue 
such products include older products for which prices are reduced during product transitions  embedded products for both desktop printers and copiers  and stand alone servers and embedded controllers for black and white copiers 
if such sales increase as a percentage of the company s revenue  gross margins may further decline 
the increase in gross margin in as compared to was due to the fact that the company benefited in from lower component prices used in the company s products in addition to lower manufacturing costs due to economies of scale 
the company s ability to maintain current gross margins may not continue 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  the company expects to be subject to pressures to reduce prices  and as a result  gross margins for all of its products may be lower 
in general  the company believes that gross margin will continue to be impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors include the market prices that can be achieved on the company s current and future products  the availability and pricing of key components including dram and postscript interpreter software  third party manufacturing costs  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of the company s product transitions and new products  competition  and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
consequently  the company anticipates gross margins will fluctuate from period to period 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by in over and by in over operating expenses as a percentage of revenue amounted to  and for  and  respectively 
increases in operating expenses in absolute dollars of million in compared to  and million in compared to  were primarily caused by costs associated with the development and introduction of new products and the hiring of additional full time employees to support the growing business a net increase of people at december  over december  and a net increase of people at december  over december  
the company has hired additional employees to support product development as well as to support expanded operations 
the increase in operating expenses in compared to includes a million charge for in process technology that was expensed in as part of the acquisition of pipeline associates  inc and pipeline asia  inc 
the pipeline acquisition  a leading software developer specializing in postscript  html and pcl interpreter technologies 
excluding the million charge in  the increase in operating expenses in over would have been or million and in over would have been or million 
the lower percentage increase in operating expenses in over compared to over is the result of the company s successful spending control 
the company anticipates that operating expenses will continue to grow and may increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
in addition  the company anticipates additional non recurring operating expenses beginning in the first quarter of  and possibly for one or two quarters thereafter  related to the company s pending move to a new central facility in foster city  california 
the components of operating expenses are detailed below 
research and development expenses for research and development consist primarily of personnel expenses and  to a lesser extent  consulting  depreciation and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the year over year increase in research and development expenses was mainly due to an increase in research and development projects 
the majority of the increase of research and development expenses in compared to was due to headcount related costs as well as a significant increase in costs of prototype materials used for pre production units on projects under development 
the increase of research and development expenses in over was primarily due to an growth in engineering headcount in compared to the company believes that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to its continued success  and intends to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development efforts 
accordingly  the company expects that its research and development expenses may continue to increase in absolute dollars and also as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel expenses  costs for trade shows  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation  and costs associated with sales offices in the united states  europe  japan and other locations around the world 
sales and marketing expenses for were million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in sales and marketing expenses increased steadily as a percentage of revenue and in absolute dollars over the past three years 
contributing to this increase is a and increase in headcount in and  respectively 
in addition  costs required for the introduction  promotion and support of a broader range of current products with both existing and new oem relationships as well as technology alliance partners have also increased 
the company has also developed strategic relationships with well known print for pay companies  including kinko s  alphagraphics  the copymax operations of office products superstore officemax  the american speedy group of franchised printing centers including allegra print and imaging  american speedy  speedy printer  zippy print and quik print and the sampa corporation  franchiser of signal graphics printing centers 
although these relationships increase the demand for fiery products they also increase the sales and marketing expenses 
the company expects that its sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue as it continues to actively promote its products  launch new products and continue to build its sales and marketing organization  particularly in europe and asia pacific  including japan 
this increase might not proportionally increase with increases in volume  if the company s sales continue to gravitate toward desktop and embedded products which require less support from the company as the oem partners take over this role 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and  to a lesser extent  depreciation and facility costs  professional fees and other costs associated with public companies 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in while general and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue over the three year period ended  these expenses have increased in absolute dollars 
the increases in over and in over were primarily due to the increase in headcount to support the needs of the growing company s operations  including the use of outside consultants 
the company expects that its general and administrative expenses may continue to increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue in order to support the company s efforts to grow its business 
acquisition in october of  the company acquired pipeline associates  inc and pipeline asia  inc the pipeline acquisition for million  net of cash received 
the pipeline acquisition was intended to expand the company s core technologies and thereby decrease its dependence on software licensed from outside sources 
the pipeline acquisition allows the company to offer the industry s only hewlett packard approved pcl interpreter not produced by hewlett packard 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the company recorded a charge of million for in process research and development 
other income other income relates mainly to interest income and expense  and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
other income of million in decreased by from million in other income of million in increased by from million in the decrease in from is mainly due to approximately million in losses suffered on asian currency denominated transactions in the first half of although to date  the company s exposure to currency fluctuations has been relatively minor  in response to recent currency fluctuations in asia  the  company began to implement a hedging program in june in addition  the company has been earning less on interest in compared to due to a decline in market interest rates 
the increase in compared to is mainly due to an increase of the average investment balance 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in and in and  respectively 
in each of these years  the company benefited from increased tax exempt interest income  increases in foreign sales and the utilization of research and development credits in achieving a consolidated effective tax rate lower than that prescribed by the respective federal and state taxing authorities 
the company anticipates that the tax rate for will increase to reflect the fact that the federal r d credit is scheduled to expire mid year liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million to million as of december   from million as of december  working capital increased by million to million as of december   up from million as of december  these increases are primarily the result of net income  changes of balance sheet components and the exercise of employee stock options 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to a reduction in inventory levels  a reduction of receivables from subcontractors and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by  an increase in accounts receivable due to the increased volume of revenue  and a decrease in net income in from the company has continued to invest cash in short term investments  mainly municipal securities 
purchases in excess of sales of short term investments were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s capital expenditures generally consist of investments in computers and related peripheral equipment and office furniture for use in the company s operations 
the company purchased approximately million  million and million of such equipment and furniture during  and  respectively 
during  the company invested million  net of cash received  in the pipeline acquisition 
also in  the company began development of a corporate campus on a acre parcel of land in foster city  california 
during the company spent approximately million on land improvement costs and during the company spent approximately million on the land and associated improvement costs 
in addition to purchasing the land  the company entered into an agreement to lease a ten story  square foot building to be constructed in and the lessor of the building has committed to fund up to a maximum of million for the construction to be directed by the company 
rent payments for the building will commence upon completion of construction and bear a direct relationship to the carrying cost of the amount drawn on the commitment 
the initial term of the lease is years with options to purchase at any time 
as of december   the company has drawn million on the commitment 
the building construction is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of also in conjunction with the lease  the company has entered into a separate ground lease with the lessor of the building for approximately years 
the company has guaranteed a residual value associated with the building to the lessor of approximately of the lessor s funding 
if the company defaults on the lease  does not renew the lease  does not purchase the building or does not arrange for a third party purchase of the building at the end of the lease term  it may be liable to the lessor for the amount of the residual guarantee 
as part of the lease agreement the company must maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
in addition  the company has pledged certain marketable securities million at december  to be held in proportion to the amount drawn in order to secure a more favorable lease rate and avoid other covenant restrictions 
the company may use these funds at any time  but their conversion would also result in an increase to the lease rate and the imposition of additional financial covenant restrictions 
net cash provided by financing activities of million  million and million in  and  respectively  were primarily the result of exercises of common stock options and the tax benefits to the company associated with those exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities in and includes approximately million and million of repayment of bonds assumed as part of the foster city  california land acquisition 
the company s inventory consists primarily of memory subsystems  processors and asics  which are consigned to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing substantially all of the company s products 
should the company decide to purchase components and do its own manufacturing  or should it become necessary for the company to purchase and consign components other than the processors  asics or memory subsystems for its contract manufacturers  inventory balances would increase significantly  thereby reducing the company s available cash resources 
further  these contract manufacturers produce substantially all of the company s products 
the company believes that  should the services of any of these contract manufacturers become unavailable  a significant negative impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations could result 
the company is also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations if such supply were reduced or not available 
the company  along with its directors and certain officers and employees  have been named in class action lawsuits filed in both the san mateo county superior court and the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the lawsuits are all related to the precipitous decline in the trading price of the company s stock that occurred in december the company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously  but there can be no assurance that if damages are ultimately awarded against the company  the litigation will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with cash generated from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund its operations and meet capital requirements through at least year status although the company has not completed a formal contingency plan for potential year related problems  management has taken steps and continues to assess the possible effects and potential solutions for a year problem 
the company has updated substantially all of its computer system infrastructure over the last few years  thus management believes that all critical pieces of hardware and software have been represented to be year compliant by their manufacturers 
in some cases this compliance is expected to be met by releases of software updates from the manufacturers that are currently scheduled to be released in the first half of for software that is currently available and represented to be compliant  the company has performed limited tests on the manufacturer s representations 
in addition  because the company is moving into a new building during the first half of and has a relatively new computer system  the company has spent a comparatively small amount of time to date on testing 
incremental costs incurred to date related to the year problem have been less than million 
however  the company currently anticipates spending approximately million over the next fiscal year on internal resources and consultants to implement software updates  assist with testing  analyze risks associated with third parties and further develop contingency plans and capabilities 
although the company continues to review and test  based on the reviews to date  the company currently believes that year issues will not materially affect its internal mis systems 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will have identified or procured all of the resources necessary to address all critical year deficient hardware and software systems on a timely basis and the company may need to spend additional amounts to identify  modify or repair internal systems 
also  the company has tested its products to determine if the products will successfully rollover from the years to and to  and if the products will correctly recognize the date february  products first released after november  have passed internal tests for these criteria  and future products will be required to pass the same internal tests before shipping 
because the company cannot control other companies products used in conjunction with the company s products such as other companies software  the company does not intend to assure its customers that its products will meet the above referenced criteria when used in conjunction with any other software or hardware not manufactured by the company 
to date the company has not reviewed year plans and preparations of its manufacturers  suppliers  customers and other third parties with whom it does business 
the company is currently in the process of identifying and contacting these critical third parties 
the company hopes to complete this process by the end of june the company has also begun to work on contingency plans and currently believes that internal problems encountered in handling transactions could be processed manually for a short period of time 
the contingency plans will be more fully developed by the third quarter of the company continues to assess the effects and costs associated with possible year problems  however  the total effects and costs are unknown to the company at this time  and there can be no assurance that such effects and costs will not have a materially adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  or results of operations 
euro assessment eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union have established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro and have adopted the euro as a common currency as of january  the euro is trading on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the company as the company predominantly invoices in us dollars 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the reporting requirements in the respective countries and the related system  legal and taxation requirements 
the company expects that required modifications will be made on a timely basis and that such modifications will not have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance  however  the company will be able to complete such modifications to comply with euro requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
factors that could adversely affect performance the following factors may adversely impact the company s future performance and financial results reliance on oem resellers  risks associated with significant oem group concentration the company s strategy of selling principally to oems anticipates that the company will be relying on high sales volumes to a relatively small number of customers 
although there can be no assurance that the company s major customers will continue to utilize the company s products at current levels  if at all  the company expects to continue to depend upon such customers for a significant percentage of its revenues 
a decline in demand for color and black and white copiers or laser printers  or other factors affecting the computer industry in general  or major customers in particular  may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company relies upon the ability of its oems to develop new products  applications and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
the ability of these oems to meet changing customer needs and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes is essential to the company s continued success 
there is no assurance that the company s oems will effectively meet these technological challenges 
these oems  who are not within the control of the company  may incorporate into their products the technologies of other companies in addition to  or instead of the company s products  and with the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations  are not obligated to purchase products from the company 
there can be no assurance that any oem will continue to carry the company s products  and the loss of important oems  or an inability to recruit additional oems  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company s sales have been and will continue to be heavily influenced by order quantities and timing of delivery to its oems 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully maintain sales of its products in any oem channel 
the company s sales may be adversely affected if an oem introduces or supports additional products that compete with the company s products  fails to effectively market the company s products  modifies its color and black and white copiers or printers such that the company s products are no longer compatible  introduces new copiers or printers that are incompatible with the company s products  or does not allow the company s products to support all of the features available on its new copiers or printers 
although the company is pursuing  and will continue to pursue  the business of additional copier and printer oems  customer concentration will continue to be a risk due to the limited number of oems producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive to the company 
product transitions although the company plans to introduce new products  delays in the launch or availability of these products could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
product transitions also carry the risk that customers will delay or cancel orders for existing products 
if the company is not able to successfully manage product transitions or cannot guarantee the availability of products once they have been introduced  its results of operations may be adversely affected 
product diversification and coordination of development with customers the company s customers have historically requested a broader range of products with different and unique features  and the company believes that this trend may continue 
if the company cannot successfully manage the effort and risks associated with a broader range of products  its results of operations may be adversely affected 
the company s customers work closely with the company to develop products that are specific to each customer 
many of the products the company is developing require the company and its customers to coordinate development  quality testing  marketing and other tasks 
the company cannot control other companies efforts  and such coordination may result in delays that the company cannot manage by itself 
if the company cannot successfully manage the effort and risks associated with coordination  its results of operations may be adversely affected 
reliance on continued demand for the company s products that enable color printing of digital data and the effects of a potential decrease although the company has expanded its product line in recent years  and continues to explore opportunities to further diversify its business  the company s business has been focused heavily on sales of products that enable the color printing of digital data 
should conditions arise that reduce the demand for this service  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected 
the company believes that purchases of the company s products may be affected by a variety of economic conditions and considerations  and there can be no assurance that demand for the company s products will continue at current levels 
for example  although such conditions are difficult to predict  the company is not assuming that there will be significant improvement in economic conditions in asia  including japan  during the company believes that continued economic distress in japan and elsewhere in asia might limit demand in these regions for the company s products 
economic distress in other parts of the world such as brazil may also limit demand for the company s products 
the move to a single european currency  the euro  and the resulting central bank management of interest rates to maintain fixed currency exchange rates among the member nations may lead to economic conditions which adversely impact the sale of the company s products 
in addition  it is possible that individuals with responsibility for purchasing the company s products  such as information technology professionals  may choose to devote available discretionary resources to other perceived needs  such as technology expenses associated with year preparation and or euro currency conversion projects 
new product introductions the company continues to explore opportunities to develop product lines distinct from its fiery color servers 
such new products may require the investment of capital for the development of new distribution and marketing channels at an unknown cost to the company 
there can be no guarantee that the company would be successful in the development of such channels or that any new products would gain market acceptance 
if the company is not able to successfully manage the introduction of new products  its results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition to these risks  if the company is successful in introducing new products  there can be no assurance that such product introductions including more powerful products sold at a lower price will not adversely impact gross margins or sales of existing products 
competition the company has seen competition in the market from companies and products that provide similar functionality to the company s products and believes that such competition will continue and may intensify 
it is also possible that the company s customers may themselves internally develop and supply products presently sold by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully compete against other companies product offerings or their financial and other resources 
in addition to competition among suppliers of the company s products  the company believes that competition among the company s customers and potential customers  including competition over price  may increase 
such competition may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
managing growth the company continues to increase its headcount  and is working to build relationships with oems and other customers 
as a result  the number and complexity of relationships the company must manage  including relationships with customers  manufacturers  and suppliers  has increased and may increase further 
if the company cannot successfully manage growth  its results of operations may be adversely affected 
hiring and retention of employees the company depends upon skilled employees  such as software and hardware engineers  quality assurance engineers  marketing and sales professionals  and persons in administrative and managerial positions 
demand for such employees in northern california  where the company s main offices are located  is high 
to assure that the company can adequately support its business  the company undertakes a number of efforts to hire and retain qualified employees 
if the company cannot successfully hire and retain employees  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in operating results operating results may fluctuate due to factors such as demand for the company s products  success and timing of the new product introductions  price reductions by the company and its competitors  delay  cancellation or rescheduling of orders  product performance  or availability of key components 
operating results may also fluctuate due to seasonal purchasing patterns of its oem partners or the status of the company s relationships with its oem partners as well as performance of third party manufacturers or the status of the company s relationships with its key suppliers 
the company s results have followed a seasonal pattern reflecting the buying patterns of its large oem customers 
in the past  that pattern has indicated the company s fiscal fourth quarter results may be adversely affected by a desire on the part of some or all of its oem customers to slow down  or otherwise delay fourth quarter orders in an effort to minimize their inventory investment at the end of their fiscal year 
additionally  the first fiscal quarter is also a traditionally weaker quarter as the company s oem partners focus on training of their sales forces 
moreover  the company s ability to develop and market new products  the timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures  and the general demand for what are discretionary purchase items color copiers  digital black and white copiers  and color laser printers and general global economic conditions will also effect operating results 
interest rate risk the company has an investment portfolio of mainly fixed income securities classified as available for sale securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company attempts to limit these exposures by investing primarily in short term securities 
limited backlog the company typically does not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from its customers  and a substantial portion of the company s backlog is scheduled for delivery within days or less 
customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times without penalty 
sales and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of the backlog as well as bookings received 
significant portions of the company s operating expenses are fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs 
if sales do not meet the company s expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall 
volatility of stock price due to various factors  including those noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price might be subject to significant volatility 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility for the company s common stock price 
risks associated with the company s ownership of real property and transition to new facilities in early  the company anticipates moving into a new leased headquarters in foster city  california on land that the company owns 
if the company cannot successfully manage the transition  disruption to the company s business and delays in sales or development of new products could arise  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
international operations and currency fluctuations approximately  and  respectively  of the company s product revenue for the years ended  and  respectively  were attributable to sales outside north america  primarily to europe and japan 
the company expects that sales to international destinations will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue 
the company is subject to certain risks associated with international operations  including tariff regulations and requirements for export licenses  particularly with respect to the export of certain technologies  which may on occasion be delayed or difficult to obtain 
given the significance of export sales to the company  the company faces a continuing risk in that the strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  the euro and other major european currencies  and numerous southeast asian currencies could adversely impact the company s revenues and gross margin 
although the company typically invoices in us dollars  these adverse impacts could occur through lower unit demand and the necessity to lower average selling prices to compensate for the reduced strength of local currencies 
where the company does invoice in local currency  the company s cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company attempts to limit these exposures through operational strategies and where appropriate the use of hedge oriented financial market instruments 
to date the company has primarily utilized forward contracts to mitigate its exposure in these markets 
proprietary information the company relies on a combination of copyright  patent and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements  and licensing and cross licensing arrangements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that any patents that may be issued to the company  or which the company may license from third parties  or that any other proprietary rights of the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted thereunder would provide proprietary protection to the company 
infringement and potential litigation the company may receive in the future  communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that any of these claims will not result in protracted and costly litigation 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more of its products or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all

to date  the company has successfully obtained licenses to use adobe s postscript tm software for products that it offers 
however  there can be no assurance that adobe will continue to grant future licenses to adobe postscript tm software on reasonable terms  in a timely manner  or at all  or that adobe will continue to give quality assurance approvals 
such actions by adobe may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
if adobe does not grant the company such licenses or approvals  if the adobe license agreements are terminated  or if the company s relationship with adobe is otherwise impaired  the company s operations may be adversely affected 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results have historically been subject to quarterly fluctuations due  for example  to the following factors economic situations in various geographic locations around the world  acceptance of new products by oem partners and their customers  demand of the company s oem partners  which is in turn subject to fluctuations because of customer demand and inventory levels  timing of training and product releases by the company s oem partners and the company s timing of expenses which could affect one quarter significantly more than another for example  the pipeline acquisition which was consummated during the fourth quarter of and expenditures in connection with the move to the new corporate headquarters 
the company anticipates that future operating results might be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including the changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
foreign exchange contracts as of mid  the company started to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the transactions hedged were intercompany accounts receivable and payable between the company and its japanese subsidiary 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the reporting periods of the hedged transactions 
foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances and the offsetting losses and gains on forward foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the income statement 
as of december   the company had one outstanding forward foreign exchange contract to sell yen equivalent to approximately million with an expiration date of january  the estimated fair value of the foreign currency contract represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices 
as of december   the difference between the fair value of the outstanding contract and the contract amount was immaterial 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase of the amount of yen to purchase one us dollar 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate for this currency would change the fair value by approximately million 
however  since the contract hedges foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contract would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged 
interest rate risk the fair value of the company s cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from an instantaneous hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment portfolio 
as of december   the company s cash and short term investment portfolio includes debt securities of million  subject to interest rate risk 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of fair value of approximately million 
the fair value of the company s long term debt  including current maturities was estimated to be million as of december   and equaled the carrying value 
the company s long term debt requires interest payments based on a variable rate and therefore is subject to interest rate risk 
a fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the outstanding long term debt of the company as of december
