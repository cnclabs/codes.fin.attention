year and euro 
the year issue arises as a result of computer programs having been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  among other problems 
any information technology it systems that have time sensitive software might recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations and system failures 
the problem also extends to many non it systems  that is  operating and control systems that rely on embedded chip systems 
in addition  the company is at risk from year failures on the part of third party suppliers and governmental agencies with which the company interacts 
the company uses a significant number of computer software programs and embedded operating systems that are essential to its operations 
for this reason  the company implemented a year project in late so that the company s computer systems would function properly in the year and thereafter 
the company s year project involves the review of a number of internal and third party systems 
each system is subjected to the project s five phases which consist of systems inventory  evaluation and analysis  modification implementation  user testing and integration compliance 
the systems are currently in various stages of completion 
the company anticipates completing its review of systems in the second quarter of and believes that  with modifications to its existing software and systems and or conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the company has also initiated communications and on site visits with its significant suppliers  vendors and governmental agencies with which its systems interface and exchange data or upon which its business depends 
the company is coordinating efforts with these parties to minimize the extent to which its business may be vulnerable to their failure to remediate their own year problems 
the company s business is dependent upon certain domestic and foreign governmental organizations or entities such as the federal aviation administration faa that provide essential aviation industry infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that the systems of such third parties on which the company s business relies including those of the faa will be modified on a timely basis 
the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of its equipment or systems or those operated by other parties to operate properly beyond although the company currently has day to day operational contingency plans  management is in the process of updating these plans for possible year specific operational requirements 
the company anticipates completing the revision of current contingency plans and the creation of additional contingency plans by september in addition  the company will continue to monitor third party including governmental readiness and will modify its contingency plans accordingly 
while the company does not currently expect any significant modification of its operations in response to the year issue  in a worst case scenario the company could be required to alter its operations significantly 
the total cost of the company s year project excluding internal payroll is currently estimated at million and has been and will be funded through cash from operations 
as of december   the company had incurred and expensed approximately million relating to its year project 
the cost of the year project is limited by the substantial outsourcing of the company s systems and the significant implementation of new systems following the company s emergence from bankruptcy 
the costs of the company s year project and the date on which the company believes it will be completed are based on management s best estimates and include assumptions regarding third party modification plans 
however  in particular due to the potential impact of third party modification plans  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated

continental has commenced the expansion of its facilities at its hopkins international airport hub in cleveland  which expansion is expected to be completed in the third quarter of the expansion  which will include a new jet concourse for the regional jet service offered by express  as well as other facility improvements  is expected to cost approximately million and is being funded principally by a combination of tax exempt special facilities revenue bonds issued in march and general airport revenue bonds issued in december by the city of cleveland 
in connection therewith  continental has entered into a long term lease with the city of cleveland under which rental payments will be sufficient to service the related bonds

as a result of the decline of the yen against the dollar  a weak japanese economy and increased fuel costs  cmi s operating earnings declined during and although cmi s results in asia have declined significantly in recent years  the company successfully redeployed cmi capacity into the stronger domestic markets and cmi s most recent results have improved 
in addition  the company has entered into petroleum call option contracts  petroleum swap contracts and jet fuel purchase commitments to provide some short term protection generally three to six months against a sharp increase in jet fuel prices  and has entered into forward contracts and purchased foreign currency average rate option contracts to hedge a portion of its japanese yen denominated ticket sales against a significant depreciation in the value of the yen versus the united states dollar 
during  continental began block space arrangements whereby it is committed to purchase capacity on other carriers at an aggregate cost of approximately million per year 
these arrangements are for years 
pursuant to other block space arrangements  other carriers are committed to purchase capacity at a cost of approximately million on continental 
management believes that the company s costs are likely to be affected in the future by i higher aircraft rental expense as new aircraft are delivered  ii higher wages  salaries and related costs as the company compensates its employees comparable to industry average  iii changes in the costs of materials and services in particular  the cost of fuel  which can fluctuate significantly in response to global market conditions  iv changes in governmental regulations and taxes affecting air transportation and the costs charged for airport access  including new security requirements  v changes in the company s fleet and related capacity and vi the company s continuing efforts to reduce costs throughout its operations  including reduced maintenance costs for new aircraft  reduced distribution expense from using continental s electronic ticket product  e ticket and the internet for bookings  and reduced interest expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions the company is subject to certain market risks  including commodity price risk ie  aircraft fuel prices  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and price changes related to investments in equity securities 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
aircraft fuel 
the company s results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
during  aircraft fuel accounted for of the company s operating expenses excluding fleet disposition impairment loss 
based on the company s projected fuel consumption  a one cent change in the average annual price per gallon of aircraft fuel would impact the company s annual aircraft fuel expense by approximately million  after the effect of hedging instruments and jet fuel purchase commitments in place as of december  in order to provide short term protection generally three to six months  the company has entered into petroleum call options  petroleum swap contracts and jet fuel purchase commitments 
the company s fuel hedging strategy could result in the company not fully benefiting from certain fuel price declines 
as of december   the company had hedged approximately of its projected fuel requirements  including related to the first quarter and related to the second quarter using petroleum swap contracts 
the company estimates that at december   a ten percent change in the price per gallon of aircraft fuel would have changed the fair value of the existing petroleum swap contracts by million 
foreign currency 
the company is exposed to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenue and expenses 
the company s largest exposure comes from the japanese yen 
the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december  levels relative to the yen would result in an estimated decrease in operating income of approximately million for  after the effect of hedging instruments in place 
however  the company is attempting to mitigate the effect of certain potential foreign currency losses by purchasing foreign currency average rate option contracts and entering into forward contracts that effectively enable it to sell japanese yen expected to be received from yen denominated ticket sales over the next nine to twelve months at specified dollar amounts 
as of december   the company had purchased average rate options and entered into forward contracts to hedge approximately of its first and second quarter projected net yen denominated cash flows and of its third quarter projected net yen denominated cash flows 
the company estimates that at december   a strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the yen would have increased the fair value of the existing average rate options and forward contracts by million 
interest rates 
the company s results of operations are affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg  interest expense on debt and interest income earned on short term investments 
the company had approximately million of variable rate debt as of december  the company has mitigated its exposure on certain variable rate debt by entering into an interest rate cap notional amount of million as of december  which expires in july the interest rate cap limits the amount of potential increase in the libor rate component of the floating rate to a maximum of over the term of the contract 
if average interest rates increased by during as compared to  the company s projected interest expense would increase by approximately million 
the interest rate cap does not mitigate this increase in interest expense materially 
as of december   the fair value of billion carrying value of the company s fixed rate debt was estimated to be billion  based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december  the fair value of the remaining fixed rate debt with a carrying value of million and primarily relating to aircraft modification notes and various loans with immaterial balances was not practicable to estimate due to the large number and small dollar amounts of these notes 
if average short term interest rates decreased by over average rates  the company s projected interest income from short term investments would decrease by approximately million during investments in equity securities 
continental s investment in america west holdings at december   which was recorded at its fair value of million and includes unrealized gains of million  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges and amounts to less than million 
the company also has a investment in amadeus global travel distribution sa amadeus and a equity investment in compania panamena de aviacion  sa copa which are also subject to price risk 
however  since a readily determinable market value does not exist for either amadeus or copa each is privately held  the company is unable to quantify the amount of price risk sensitivity inherent in these investments 
at december   the carrying value of these investments was million and million  respectively 
at december   the carrying value of amadeus was million
