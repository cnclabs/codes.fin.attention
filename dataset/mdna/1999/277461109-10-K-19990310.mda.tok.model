year in  the company established a formal global program office to assess the impact of the year issue on the software and hardware utilized in the company s internal operations and included in its product offerings to customers 
the assessment addresses software applications  systems software  information technology it infrastructure  embedded manufacturing control technology  and products and services 
representatives of the global program office and operating divisions meet monthly with the chief financial officer to monitor program status and address issues 
in june  an independent third party completed a comprehensive review of the company s overall year program 
in october and december and february  senior line management presented status reports to the board of directors 
the project phases include inventorying affected technology and assessing the impact of the year issue  developing solution plans  modification  testing and certification  implementation  and developing contingency plans 
all components of software and hardware of the company are presently in various phases 
the company expects to have its mission critical it systems and server infrastructure tested and compliant by the end of the first quarter of  and manufacturing control systems year compliant by mid year the company also expects that actively supported products and services  which are presently in the first five phases  will be compliant by the end of august the product commercialization process has been modified so that it will produce compliant products 
during the fourth quarter of  the project team continued to increase its global mission critical it compliance  used mainframe test facilities to simulate remaining mission critical formal applications  completed assessment and solution plans for the company s us server network and allocated resources to support the workplan 
the project team drove advances in remediation of products and services  and in compliance of operating divisions and third parties 
the company relies on third party suppliers for many systems  products and services including telecommunications and data center support 
the company will be adversely impacted if these suppliers do not make necessary changes to their own systems and products successfully and in a timely manner 
the company has a formalized comprehensive supplier compliance program in place 
as a third party supplier to other companies  the company has posted its own product compliance plan on its internet web site www 
kodak 
com go year  which was enhanced during the third quarter of to support customer and business partner inquiries 
costs of software and hardware remediation were million in  million in  and are estimated to be million and million in and  respectively 
these remediation efforts  almost entirely for software  will not materially increase the company s spending on information technology because some normal development and maintenance work has been postponed 
furthermore  some non compliant systems will be eliminated in as the company installs year compliant globally deployed erp sap software in connection with its enterprise resource planning project 
a charge for the total cost of customer product modification of million was accrued in at december   the company had a reserve of million to cover remaining product modifications 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
however  since it is not possible to anticipate all possible future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there could be worst case scenarios in which the company would be unable to take customer orders  manufacture and ship products  invoice customers or collect payments 
in addition  the company could be subject to litigation for year related product failure  including equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business or medical records  and for health  environmental and safety issues relating to its facilities 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated 
the company has contingency plans for some mission critical applications and is working on plans for others 
for example  plans for the us payroll system have been in place since january  while detailed plans for sensitized goods manufacturing will be completed by mid year an executive steering committee is closely monitoring the progress of enterprise and business process contingency plans involving  among other actions  manual workarounds  increased inventories and extra staffing 
the euro the treaty on european union provided that an economic and monetary union emu be established in europe whereby a single european currency  the euro  replaces the currencies of participating member states 
the euro was introduced on january   at which time the value of participating member state currencies was irrevocably fixed against the euro and the european currency unit ecu was replaced at the rate of one euro to one ecu 
for the three year transitional period ending december   the national currencies of member states will continue to circulate but be sub units of the euro 
new public debt will be issued in euro and existing debt may be redominated into euro 
at the end of the transitional period  euro banknotes and coins will be issued  and the national currencies of the member states will cease to be legal tender no later than june  the countries which adopted the euro on january  are austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal  and spain 
other countries are expected to follow later 
the company has operations in all of these countries 
as a result of the euro conversion  it is probable that selling prices of the company s products and services will experience downward pressure  as current price variations among countries are reduced due to easy comparability of euro prices across countries 
prices will tend to harmonize  although value added taxes and transportation costs will still justify price differentials 
adoption of the euro will probably accelerate existing market and pricing trends including pan european buying and general price erosion 
on the other hand  currency exchange and hedging costs will be significantly reduced  lower prices and pan european buying will benefit the company in its purchasing endeavors  the number of banks and suppliers needed will be reduced  there will be less variation in payment terms  and it will be easier for the company to expand into new marketing channels such as mail order and internet marketing 
the company is in the process of making changes in areas such as marketing and pricing  purchasing  contracts  payroll  taxes  cash management and treasury operations 
billing systems will be modified so that  in  the company will be able to show total gross  value added tax  and net in euros on national currency invoices  to enable customers to pay in the new euro currency if they wish to do so 
systems for pricing  payroll and expense reimbursements will continue to use national currencies until year end the functional currencies of the company s operations in affected countries will remain the national currencies until approximately year end  when they will change to the euro 
the systems costs of adopting the euro are estimated to be less than million since many non euro compliant systems will be eliminated as the company installs erp sap software in connection with its enterprise resource planning project 
the company plans to be at least minimally euro compliant when necessary  and is preparing contingency plans to address potential delays in systems implementation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and interest rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
see note  financial instruments  for further discussion of the company s policy for managing such exposures 
the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in australian  british  french  german  irish and spanish currencies 
the magnitude and nature of such hedging activities are explained further in note  financial instruments 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and increased  the company would incur a million and million loss on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  and  respectively 
such losses would be substantially offset by gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged 
increased foreign currency exchange rate risk from december  is caused by a higher notional value of contracts to buy french francs offset by a lower notional value of contracts to sell british pounds 
the company has used silver option and forward contracts to minimize almost all of its exposure to increases in silver prices in and will continue to do so in as of december   the company had open forward contracts hedging the majority of its planned silver requirements for based on broker quoted termination values  if the price of silver decreased from and per troy ounce at december  and  respectively  the fair value of silver forward contracts would be reduced by million and million  respectively 
increased silver price risk from december  is caused by a higher notional amount of silver hedging contracts outstanding at december  such losses in fair value  if realized  would be offset by lower costs of manufacturing silver containing products 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities and less so through investments in marketable securities 
the company utilizes us dollar denominated commercial paper and borrowings as well as foreign currency denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of short term and long term borrowings and marketable securities are in fixed rate instruments 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings and marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
using a yield to maturity analysis  if december  interest rates increased about basis points with the december  level of short term and long term borrowings  there would be decreases in fair value of short term and long term borrowings of million and million  respectively 
if december  interest rates increased about basis points with the december  level of debt and marketable securities  there would be decreases in fair value of marketable securities  short term and long term borrowings of million  million and million  respectively
