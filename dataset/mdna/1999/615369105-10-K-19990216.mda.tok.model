recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designated specifically as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction a cash flow hedge  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the company currently hedges foreign currency denominated transactions and will comply with the requirements of sfas no 
when adopted 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company expects to adopt sfas no 
beginning january  the effect of adopting sfas no 
is not expected to be material 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
among other provisions  sop requires that entities capitalize certain internal use software costs once certain criteria are met 
under sop  overhead  general and administrative  and training costs are not to be capitalized 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   therefore  the company will adopt the provisions as of january  during  the company capitalized approximately million of costs incurred in developing internal use software  which would not be capitalized in the future 
market risk sensitive instruments because the company operates in countries  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates  which could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates  the company sometimes uses forward foreign exchange contracts and in the past has used interest rate swap agreements 
these derivative financial instruments are viewed by the company as risk management tools that are entered into for hedging purposes only 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company also has investments in fixed income marketable securities 
consequently  the company is exposed to fluctuations in rates on these marketable securities 
market risk associated with investments in marketable securities is immaterial and has been excluded from the sensitivity discussions 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements on pages of this form k 
the following analysis presents the sensitivity of the fair value of the company s market risk sensitive instruments to changes in market rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk through its commercial paper program  where it borrows at prevailing short term commercial paper rates 
at december   the company had million of commercial paper outstanding and as such the market risk is immaterial when calculated utilizing estimates of the termination value based upon a increase or decrease in interest rates from their december  levels 
the company has in the past entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps have allowed the company to raise funds at floating rates and effectively swap them into fixed rates that are lower than those available to it if fixed rate borrowings were to be made directly 
during  in connection with the distribution and repayment of outstanding notes payable  old d b canceled all of its interest rate swap agreements 
the company has not entered into any interest rate swap agreements since the distribution and therefore is not subject to interest rate risk on interest rate swaps 
foreign exchange risk the company s non us operations generated approximately of total revenues in as of december   approximately of the company s assets were located outside the us  and no single country had a significant concentration of cash 
the company follows a policy of hedging substantially all cross border intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of its various subsidiaries 
the company only uses forward foreign exchange contracts to implement its hedging strategy 
typically  these contracts have maturities of six months or less 
these forward contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in british pounds sterling  german marks and swedish krona 
the fair value of foreign currency risk is calculated by using estimates of the cost of closing out all outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts  given a increase or decrease in forward rates from their december   levels 
at december   the company had approximately million in forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding  with various expiration dates through march see note to the company s consolidated financial statements on pages of this form k 
at december   net unrealized gains related to the company s forward contracts were 
million 
if forward rates were to increase by from december   levels  the unrealized loss on these contracts would be million 
if forward rates were to decrease by from december   levels  the unrealized gain on these contracts would be million 
however  the estimated potential gain or loss on forward contracts is expected to be offset by changes in the underlying transactions 
therefore  the impact of a movement in foreign exchange rates would be immaterial 
liquidity and financial position the company generates significant cash flows from its business operations 
management believes that these cash flows are sufficient to fund its operating needs  service debt and pay dividends  and will continue to be sufficient in the future 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  an increase from million in net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations decreased by million to million in this decrease is largely attributable to the impact on the timing of cash flows resulting from the change to the d b business model implemented effective january   whereby customers now have the option of choosing to purchase credit products and services on a monthly or annual contract plan  offset by an increase in income from continuing operations 
previously  credit products and services were generally sold under annual contracts  most of which required payment in full up front 
net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations decreased by million to million in  as only six months of operations were included in historically  donnelley generated most of its cash flows in the second half of the year 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  compared with million in cash used in investing activities in was offset by cash provided by discontinued operations of million  which included the proceeds from the sale of p east of million  partially offset by capital expenditures 
this compared to net cash used by investing activities of discontinued operations in of million 
cash flows included proceeds from the sale of fis of million 
in  spending for capital expenditures  computer software and other intangibles by continuing operations totaled million  compared to million in this increase is largely due to investment in new computer hardware and software 
currently  the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
in june  the company arranged million of bank commitments under two credit facilities 
each facility permits borrowings up to million  with one maturing in june and one maturing in june under these facilities  the company has the ability to borrow at prevailing short term interest rates 
as of december   the company did not have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
the company had commercial paper borrowings of million at december  in connection with the distribution  during june  rh donnelley inc borrowed million under the rh donnelley inc credit facility and issued million of senior subordinated notes under the rh donnelley inc indenture 
the proceeds of these borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness commercial paper and other short term borrowings of old d b in the amount of million at the time of the distribution  the company used the excess proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the payment of reorganization costs 
the million of debt became an obligation of donnelley upon the distribution 
in connection with the distribution and repayment of existing indebtedness  old d b canceled all of its interest rate swap agreements and recorded into income the previously unrecognized fair value loss at the time of termination 
at the time of the cancellation  the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a loss of million  of which million 
million in the first quarter of and million in had been recognized in income relating to swaps which did not qualify for settlement accounting 
the previously unrecognized loss of million was recorded during the second quarter of and included in reorganization costs 
on april   old d b completed a million minority interest financing 
funds raised by this financing were used to repay a portion of the outstanding short term debt in april also during the second quarter of  old d b reentered the commercial paper market and used the proceeds to repay the additional amounts outstanding on the short term debt facility 
the obligation related to the minority interest financing became an obligation of the company upon the distribution 
at december   the company had million of minority interest financing outstanding 
on june   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of common shares from time to time over the next three years in the open market or in negotiated purchases 
in addition  the board authorized the company to repurchase shares as needed to offset awards under the company s incentive plans 
as of december   the company purchased million shares under the repurchase program for a total of million 
in addition  during  the company purchased million shares to offset awards made under incentive plans for approximately million 
the company received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million during the company enters into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business 
the internal revenue service irs is currently reviewing the utilization of certain capital losses during and  and the company expects that the irs will challenge the company s treatment of certain of these losses 
if an assessment is made and should the irs prevail  the total cash obligation to the irs would approximate million for taxes and accrued interest as of december  pursuant to a series of agreements  ims health incorporated ims and nielsen media research nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay one half  and the company the other half  of any payments for taxes and accrued interest arising from this matter and certain other potential tax liabilities after the company pays the first million 
if assessed  the company will consider available alternatives to vigorously defend its position 
certain alternatives would require making a payment to the irs for its share of the taxes and accrued interest approximately million  of which million represents tax deductible interest  which would be repaid to the company if it prevails in its position 
the funds that would be needed to make the company s share of such payment are expected to come from external borrowings 
year general the company relies on computer hardware  software and related information technology it systems 
it systems are used in the creation and delivery of the company s products and services  and also are used in the company s internal operations  such as billing and accounting 
it systems include systems that use information provided by third party data suppliers to update the company s databases 
the company also relies on other systems  such as elevators  and on utilities  such as telecommunications and power utilities  to operate non it systems 
the company has recognized the potential impact of the year on its business since  when it began actively addressing the information technology related components of the year issue in its european and us operations 
in  the company created a corporate year program office to manage overall risks and to facilitate activities across the company 
the corporate year program office reports directly to the company s year executive committee comprised of the company s chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief technology officer and chief legal counsel  which sets overall priorities and monitors progress 
since  each operating unit has had business and technology executives and project teams in place to plan and carry out all year efforts within their units 
the company has used the services of outside consultants and subject area specialists working with the corporate year program office to assess the progress of its year program 
the most important areas of focus of the company s year program are the company s products and services including its databases  software that manipulates these databases and software provided to customers  billing  ordering and tracking systems  technical infrastructure such as lans  mail systems and web sites  desktop computers  suppliers  business operation support systems such as payroll  and facilities and equipment 
state of readiness the company has focused its efforts on becoming year ready 
the company defines this term to mean that a process will continue to run in the same manner when dealing with dates on or after january   as it did before january  with respect to it systems  the company s year program includes the following phases inventory  assessment  remediation  year ready testing and transaction based testing 
year ready testing involves two major tests 
a system test checks the system s functions in a year test environment that uses simulated or forward dated system clocks and a variety of other simulated forward dated data or systems interfaces as required 
a production integration test confirms that the system will continue to perform its current date processes when put into production 
transaction based testing further tests the company s most critical work flows at regional and global levels 
early in its year program  the company categorized its it systems in terms of criticality to allow the work to be performed consistent with its importance to the company 
criticality systems are defined as those systems that are most critical to the company s business and revenue 
criticality systems are defined as those systems that are very important to the company and would have a severe impact on business and revenue if not made year ready 
criticality systems are not essential but would have some impact on business and revenue if not made year ready 
criticality systems have little or no impact on business and revenue and are scheduled to be decommissioned prior to the year as of december   the company had completed more than of the steps required to achieve year readiness of the company s approximately  criticality and criticality it systems 
the company s current target is for substantially all criticality and criticality it systems to be year ready by march  transaction based testing of the company s most critical work flows  work on criticality it systems and decommissioning of criticality it systems have begun and will continue through the corporate year program office and operating unit year teams are also addressing year readiness issues regarding the company s non it systems 
as part of its year program  the company has categorized its suppliers in terms of criticality 
criticality suppliers are those whose products and services are most critical to the company 
criticality suppliers are those whose products and services are very important to the company but for whom workarounds can be established and operable by june   if the products and services that the company obtains from such suppliers are not year ready 
criticality suppliers are those who could be replaced easily and reasonably inexpensively 
in  the company began its assessment of its criticality and criticality suppliers  and its current target is to substantially complete such assessment by march  such assessment involves the identification of those suppliers who will be sufficiently year ready  identification of those who will not be sufficiently ready  requiring the company to switch to an alternate supplier or product  identification of those suppliers who have some issues but with whom it is most prudent for the company to continue its relationship  and identification of those suppliers for whom testing will be necessary 
in instances where such testing is not possible for example  it may not be possible for the company to test the operational ability of its telecommunications  electricity or gas service suppliers in a year environment and alternate sources of supply are not feasible  the company may have to rely on the assurances of the supplier 
costs external and internal costs associated with modifying software for year readiness are expensed as incurred and are funded through operating cash flow 
it is currently estimated that the aggregate cost of the company s year program will be approximately million 
the increase from the prior estimate of million to million is attributable to the refinement of estimates associated with contingency planning 
through december   the company had incurred approximately million million in and million in and expects to incur approximately million in and million in these estimates do not include the costs of software and systems that are being replaced or upgraded in the normal course of business 
risks and contingency plans the company believes that it will substantially complete the implementation of its year program prior to january  if the company does not complete its year program prior to the commencement of the year  if it fails to identify and remediate all critical year problems  or if major suppliers or customers experience material year problems  the company s results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected 
contingency planning is under way in all of the company s businesses 
in addition to supplier related activities  high level plans have been developed for facilities and equipment  telecommunications infrastructure  product development and fulfillment  and internal administrative processes 
these plans take into account human resources and communications issues that relate to the company s employees 
by the end of june  the company expects to have detailed contingency plans in place to address the most likely remaining effects on the company from external risks 
as more information emerges about companies upon which the company is critically reliant  these plans will be adjusted accordingly 
new european currency on january   eleven of the countries in the european union began a three year transition to a single european currency euro to replace the national currency of each participating country 
the company intends to phase in the transition to the euro over the next three years 
the company has established a task force to address issues related to the euro 
the company believes that the euro conversion may have a material impact on its operations and financial condition if it fails to successfully address such issues 
the task force has prepared a project plan and is proceeding with the implementation of that plan 
the company s project plan includes the following ensuring that the company s information technology systems that process data for inclusion in the company s products and services can appropriately handle amounts denominated in euro contained in data provided to the company by third party data suppliers  modification of the company s products and services to deal with euro related issues  and modification of the company s internal systems such as payroll  accounting and financial reporting to deal with euro related issues 
the company does not believe that the cost of such modifications will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there is no guarantee that all problems will be foreseen and corrected  or that no material disruption of the company s business will occur 
the conversion to the euro may have competitive implications for the company s pricing and marketing strategies  which could be material in nature  however  any such impact is not known at this time 
dividends the company paid a quarterly dividend of 
per share for the third and fourth quarters of old d b paid quarterly dividends of 
per share during the first half of and the full year of  resulting in a full year dividend per share paid of
