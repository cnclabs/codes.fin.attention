in the event that the company is unable to obtain such additional capital or is unable to obtain such additional capital on acceptable terms  it may be required to reduce the scope of its expansion  which could adversely affect its business prospects and its ability to compete 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise equity capital  obtain capital lease or bank financing or incur other borrowings on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  to fund any such expansion or otherwise 
year general 
primus is reviewing its network elements  computer systems  software applications and other business systems in order to determine if any of these systems will not properly reflect or recognize the year because many computer and computer applications define dates by the last two digits of the year  could be interpreted to mean the year  rather than the year this error could result in miscalculations or system failures 
year issues may also affect the systems and applications of primus customers  vendors or resellers 
compliance program 
beginning in  primus began a comprehensive inventory and year assessment of its principal computer systems  network elements  software applications and other business systems 
primus expects to complete its inventory and assessment and begin repairing or replacing the most critical network elements and significant management systems that are determined not to be year compliant during the first quarter of primus expects to complete the repair  replacement  testing and certification of substantially all non compliant network elements by september  primus is using both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its systems for year compliance 
suppliers 
primus is also contacting third party suppliers of major equipment  software  systems and services used by the company to identify and  to the extent possible  to resolve issues involving year compliance 
however  the company has limited or no control over the actions of these third party suppliers 
consequently  while primus expects that it will be able to resolve any significant year issues with regard to its systems and services  there can be no assurance that its suppliers will resolve any or all year issues before the occurrence of a material disruption to the business of the company or any of its customers 
costs 
primus expects to incur approximately to million in expenditures in to complete its year compliance program 
the costs of modifying the company s network elements  software and systems for year compliance are being funded from existing cash resources and are being charged to expense as incurred 
risks 
primus believes that it will complete the implementation of its year program prior to december  consequently  the company does not believe that year issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  cash flows  or results of operations 
however  if the company does not achieve compliance prior to december   if it fails to identify and remedy all critical year problems or if major suppliers or customers experience material year problems  the company s results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
primus has determined that non compliant network elements may result in improperly routed traffic and that non compliant  non network systems may result in errors in customer billing and accounting records 
contingency plans 
primus has begun to develop appropriate contingency plans to mitigate  to the extent possible  any significant year noncompliance 
the company expects to complete its contingency plans by september  if primus is required to implement its contingency plans  the cost of year compliance may be greater than the amount referenced above and there can be no assurance that these plans will be adequate 
special note regarding forward looking statements statements in this annual report on form k  including those concerning the company s expectations of future sales  net revenue  gross profit  net income  network development  traffic development  capital expenditures  selling  general and administrative expenses  service introductions and cash requirements include certain forward looking statements 
as such  actual results may vary materially from such expectations 
factors  which could cause results to differ from expectations  include risks associated with limited operating history  entry into developing markets 
the company was founded in february  began generating revenue in march and acquired its most significant operating subsidiaries  primus australia formerly axicorp and trescom  in march and june  respectively 
the company intends to enter markets where it has limited or no operating experience 
the company s prospects should be considered in light of risks  expenses  problems and delays inherent in establishing a new business in a rapidly changing industry 
managing rapid growth 
the company s strategy of rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company 
in order to manage its growth effectively  the company must continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and controls  purchase and utilize additional transmission facilities  and expand  train and manage its employees  all within a rapidly changing regulatory environment 
inaccuracies in the company s forecast of traffic could result in insufficient or excessive transmission facilities and disproportionate fixed expenses 
substantial indebtedness  liquidity 
the company currently has substantial indebtedness and anticipates that it and its subsidiaries will incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of the company s indebtedness i could make it more difficult for it to make payments of interest on its outstanding debt  ii could limit the ability of the company to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  iii requires that a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations  if any  be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and other obligations and  accordingly  will not be available for use in its business  iv could limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business  v results in the company being more highly leveraged than some of its competitors  which may place it at a competitive disadvantage  and vi will make it more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business 
historical and future operating losses  negative ebitda  net losses 
since inception  primus had cumulative negative cash flow from operating activities and cumulative negative ebitda 
in addition  primus incurred net losses in   and and has an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  the company expects to continue to incur additional operating losses and negative cash flow as it expands its operations and continues to build out and upgrade its network 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenue will grow or be sustained in future periods or that it will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operations in any future period 
acquisition and strategic investment risks 
acquisitions  a key element in the company s growth strategy  involve operational risks  including the possibility that an acquisition does not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by management  while the company continues to incur operating expenses to provide the services formerly provided by the acquired company  and financial risks including the incurrence of indebtedness by the company in order to affect the acquisition and the consequent need to service that indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates  completing and financing additional acquisitions on favorable terms  or integrating the acquired business or assets into its own 
intense competition 
the long distance telecommunications industry is intensely competitive and is significantly influenced by the marketing and pricing decisions of the larger industry participants 
competition in all of the company s markets is likely to increase and  as deregulatory influences are experienced in markets outside the united states  competition in non united states markets is likely to become similar to the intense competition in the united states 
many of the company s competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources and larger networks than the company  a broader portfolio of service offerings  greater control over transmission lines  stronger name recognition and customer loyalty  as well as long standing relationships with the company s target customers 
in addition  many of the company s competitors enjoy economies of scale that result in a lower cost structure for transmission and related costs which could cause significant pricing pressures within the industry 
dependence on transmission facilities based carriers 
the company s ability to maintain and expand its business is dependent upon whether the company continues to maintain favorable relationships with the transmission facilities based carriers to carry the company s traffic 
international operations 
in many international markets  the existing carrier will control access to the local networks  enjoy better brand recognition and brand and customer loyalty  and have significant operational economies  including a larger backbone network and correspondent agreements 
moreover  the existing carrier may take many months to allow competitors  including the company  to interconnect to its switches within its territory 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the permits and operating licenses required for it to operate  obtain access to local transmission facilities or to market services in international markets 
in addition  operating in international markets generally involves additional risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political risks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  foreign exchange controls which restrict repatriation of funds  technology export and import restrictions  seasonal reductions in business activity 
dependence on effective information systems 
the company s management information systems must grow as the company s business expands and are expected to change as new technological developments occur 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter delays or cost overruns or suffer adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year and are vulnerable to the year problem which could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement upgrades to its systems to correct any year problem 
a failure of the company s computer systems  or the failure of the company s vendors or customers to effectively upgrade their software and systems for transition to the year  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition or results of operations 
industry changes 
the international telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation  privatization  technological improvements  expansion of infrastructure and the globalization of the world s economies 
in order to compete effectively  the company must adjust its contemplated plan of development to meet changing market conditions 
the telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements 
the company s profitability will depend on its ability to anticipate  assess and adapt to rapid technological changes and its ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  services that meet evolving industry standards 
network development  migration of traffic 
the long term success of the company is dependent upon its ability to design  implement  operate  manage and maintain the network 
the company could experience delays or cost overruns in the implementation of the network  or its ability to migrate traffic onto its network  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on key personnel 
the loss of the services of k 
paul singh  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  or the services of its other key personnel  or the inability of the company to attract and retain additional key management  technical and sales personnel for which competition is intense in the telecommunications industry  could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
government regulation 
the company s operations are subject to constantly changing regulation 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company  or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to the company s compliance or non compliance with applicable regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency as noted above  although the company s functional currency is the united states dollar  a significant portion of the company s net revenue is derived from its sales and operations outside the united states 
in the future  the company expects to continue to derive a significant portion of its net revenue and incur a significant portion of its operating costs outside the united states  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in foreign countries have been funded with investments and other advances 
due to the long term nature of such investments and advances  the company accounts for any adjustments resulting from translation as a charge or credit to accumulated other comprehensive loss within the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
the company historically has not engaged in hedging transactions 
interest rates the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates are its senior notes  and its senior notes
