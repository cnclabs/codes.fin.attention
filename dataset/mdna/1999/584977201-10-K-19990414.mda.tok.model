impact of year the year issue arises from the fact that many computer systems rely on a two digit date code to identify the year eg to represent and thus may not be able to differentiate between the year and the year if not corrected  systems processing date dependent information may fail or create erroneous results  causing disruptions of operations  including  but not limited to  a temporary inability to process transactions  report results  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activity 
the company has completed its assessment of its internal computer systems and has determined that modification to some portion of its software is required so that its computer systems function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company presently believes that with modification to existing software and conversion to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the company has initiated formal communication with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties ability to resolve their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be timely converted or that a failure to convert or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s system would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
supplier response is not yet complete and the company is continuing to work to conclude this area of its year assessment 
the company anticipates completing the year project prior to any adverse impact on its computer operating system  however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company continues to assess its readiness relative to year issues and will develop a contingency plan for all items not resolved at the end of the first quarter 
the cost of the year project is not expected to be material 
changes required to internally supported software are minor compared to the modifications performed in the normal course of business and the company plans to use internal resources and delay other projects to complete these year modifications 
updates to externally supported software are covered under existing service contracts or are not anticipated to have costs material in nature 
the assessment of the impact  cost  and completion of the year project is based on management s best estimates 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by factors including  but not limited to  the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans  and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes
