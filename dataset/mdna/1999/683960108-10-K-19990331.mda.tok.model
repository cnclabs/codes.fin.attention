the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including product mix  the company s ability to obtain or maintain design wins  market conditions generally and in the personal computer and semiconductor industries  product development schedules  competition and other matters 
readers are encouraged to refer to factors affecting earnings and stock price found below 
opti was founded in and is an independent volume supplier of semiconductor products to the personal computer market 
during  the company shipped more than four million core logic  peripheral products such as usb controllers and docking stations  and audio chipsets to over pc and motherboard manufacturers and add on board manufacturers located primarily in asia and the us the past year was one of continued transition for the company as it continued to experience a significant reduction in revenue and continued its initiative to develop technologies for future product applications to substitute for declining revenues in the core logic market 
compared to net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  
this decrease in sales was attributable to decreased sales of chipsets supporting the company s mobile core logic products and decreased sales from audio products after the company sold its audio assets to creative technology in november in the company shipped approximately million chipsets and peripheral products as compared to approximately million in revenue from core logic products were approximately of net sales for as compared to approximately in the remaining of revenue in was from peripheral products usb controller  audio and graphics 
the mix of revenues within the company shifted in the second half of to a higher percentage of peripheral products  specifically the usb product  and a lower percentage of core logic products 
the company expects that it will continue to experience ongoing shifts in its revenue mix  as sales of core logic chipsets continue to decline 
no assurances can be given that future revenues will reflect this product mix trend 
gross margin for increased to approximately of net sales as compared to approximately in this increase in gross margin for as compared to was primarily attributable to a change in the company s product mix from core logic to peripheral products 
in the majority of non core logic products was from audio products which carried a lower gross margin than the usb controller which was the majority of non core logic products in the company was also sucessful in in obtaining a reduction in costs of wafers used in its core logic products and a reduction in the cost of assembling its core logic products 
the company is likely to face potential inventory risks and adjustments if anticipated sales and shipments do not occur when expected 
the markets for the company s products are also subject to severe price competition and price declines 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in reducing its product costs rapidly enough to maintain its gross margin level or that further substantial reductions in chipset prices will not result in future losses 
research and development r d expenses for decreased approximately to million  compared with million for the decrease in research and development expenses from to is primarily related to the company s shift in market focus over the last year 
the company focused more heavily on notebook directed technologies in  reducing research and development spending in other areas resulting in a net reduction in spending 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for decreased approximately to million  compared with million in this decrease in sg a expenses from to was primarily attributable to decreased net sales 
net interest and other income for was million as compared to million for interest and other income consists primarily of interest income and has increased primarily due to higher average interst rates during versus the company s effective tax rate was for and for the company s effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate in due primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and the limitations controlling the timing for recognition of deferred tax assets established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for income taxes which will prevent a tax benefit for potential operating losses 
compared to net sales for decreased to million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  
this decrease in sales was attributable to decreased sales of chipsets supporting the company s desktop core logic business segment and decreased sales from the company s audio line 
in the company shipped approximately million chipsets as compared to approximately million chipsets in revenue from core logic products were approximately of net sales for as compared to approximately in the remaining of revenue in was from peripheral products audio and graphics 
the mix of revenues within the core logic area shifted to notebook core logic products in and continued in as the company had no major product wins in for desktop products 
gross margin for increased to approximately of net sales as compared to approximately in this increase in gross margin for as compared to was primarily attributable to inventory write downs taken on some of the company s pentium class desktop core logic products and reductions in selling prices for the company s pentium class desktop core logic products during fiscal r d expenses for decreased approximately to million  compared with million for the decrease in research and development expenses from to is primarily related to the company s shift in market focus over the last year as the company has focused more heavily on notebook directed technologies and has reduced the associated research and development headcount related expenses accordingly 
sg a expenses for decreased approximately to million  compared with million in this decrease in sg a expenses from to was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales expenses relating to decreased net sales 
restructuring and other expenses for were million as compared to zero for during the second quarter of the company initiated a restructuring program as a result of decisions by its chief executive officer and board of directors to adjust the company s organizational structure in order to align resources with a revised business model and to lower the company s cost structure 
the restructuring actions resulted in reducing headcount  vacating leased facilities  reducing the value of certain assets as the company moves forward with its revised business model  and other activities 
net interest and other income for was million as compared to million for interest and other income consists primarily of interest income and has increased primarily due to higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in versus in november  the company sold some of the assets associated with its audio line  substantially under the terms of the asset purchase agreement dated november   to creative technology ltd 
creative  a singapore corporation 
creative paid the company cash of million and delivered a warrant to purchase  shares of opti s common stock at a price of per share and expiring in the company s effective tax rate was provision for and a benefit for the company s effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate in due to a million increase in the company s reserve against deferred tax assets at december  the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate in due to primarily to state income taxes and an increase in the company s reserve against deferred tax assets at december  liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations through cash generated from operations and an initial public offering of equity in in  the company generated cash from operating activities of million primarily due to reductions in accounts receivable and inventories 
this was partially offset by a decrease in accrued payable and a net loss for the year 
all of these changes were a result of the company s decrease in sales in as compared with in  the company generated cash from operations of million primarily due to reductions in accounts receivable due to lower sales and an increase in accounts payable partially offset by the company s net loss for the year 
the company s investing activities provided cash of approximately million in the cash provided by investing activities was attributable to a net sale of its short term investments of approximately million  offset  in part  by purchases of property and equipment 
the company s investing activities provided cash of million in fiscal this cash generated during was primarily due to proceeds of million from the sale of the company s audio line  partially offset by  a net investment into short term investments of approximately million and a payment of approximately million to united microelectronics corporation umc under terms of the february and joint venture agreement that the company signed with umc 
as of december  the company has no further obligations under this agreement 
financing activities used cash of approximately million in this use in cash for fiscal was primarily due to the company repurchasing approximately million of its common stock based on a repurchase program announced in june and principal payments on capital leases offset  in part  by proceeds from the sale of the company s common stock 
financing activities in provided cash of approximately million 
the cash generated in was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of stock  offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations 
under the umc agreement  the company entered into a joint venture arrangement with umc  together with other us semiconductor companies  to build a separate semiconductor manufacturing facility located in taiwan at an estimated cost of billion 
the company has completed its investment commitment of million in the joint venture 
under the terms of the umc agreement  the company received an approximate equity ownership in the joint venture company and certain capacity rights 
the facility was expected to open during  but fires during construction have delayed the opening 
umc has stated that it expects insurance will cover its fire losses 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with umc to sell umc approximately million shares of stock in the joint venture wafer fabrication plant for a purchase price of approximately million 
the company received the cash on march  following the sale  the company holds no shares of stock of the joint venture 
the company s manufacturing plans and expenditure levels are based primarily upon sales forecasts 
typically  the company orders products from foundries pursuant to non cancelable purchase orders on a rolling twelve week basis while its customers generally place product orders approximately four weeks prior to delivery  which orders may be canceled without significant penalty 
the company anticipates that the rate of new orders will vary significantly from month to month 
as a result  backlog can fluctuate significantly 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments do not occur when expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million and working capital of million 
the company believes that the existing sources of liquidity as well as its million line of credit will satisfy the company s projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the end of year readiness the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company considers a product to be in year compliance if the product s performance and functionality are unaffected by processing of dates prior to  during and after the year  but only if all products for example hardware  software and firmware used with the product properly exchange accurate date data with it 
the company has a program to assess the capability of its products to determine whether or not they are in year compliance 
although the company believes its semiconductor products are in year compliance  the company has determined that certain of its products are not and will not be year compliant 
the products that will not be year compliant should not adversely effect the company 
however  the assessment of whether a complete system will operate correctly depends on the bios capability and software design and integration  and for many end users this will include bios andsoftware and components provided by companies other than opti 
the company does not believe it is legally responsible for costs incurred by customers related to ensuring such customers or end users year capability 
in addition  the company has contacted its major customers to determine whether their products into which the company s products have been and will be integrated are year compliant 
the company has received assurances of year compliance from a number of those customers and the customers are under no contractual obligation to provide such information to the company 
the company anticipates that substantial litigation may be brought against vendors  including the company  of all component products of systems that are unable to properly manage data related to the year the company s agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s liability for such claims 
it is possible  however  that these measures will not provide protection from liability claims  as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
any such claims  with or without merit  could result in a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  including increased warranty costs  customer satisfaction issues and potential lawsuits 
the company has initiated a comprehensive program to address year readiness in its internal systems and with its customers and suppliers 
the company s program has been designed to address its most critical internal systems first and to gather information regarding the year compliance of products supplied to it and into which the company s products are integrated 
assessment and remediation are proceeding in tandem  and the company intends to have its critical internal systems in year compliance by the end of the third fiscal quarter of these activities are intended to encompass all major categories of systems in use by the company  including manufacturing  engineering  sales  finance and human resources 
the costs incurred to date related to these programs have not been material 
the company currently expects that the total cost of its year readiness programs  excluding redeployed resources  will not exceed  over the next fiscal year 
the total cost estimate does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims or the costs of internal software or hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
the total cost estimate is based on the current assessment of the company s year readiness needs and is subject to change as the projects proceed 
the company has also initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and financial institutions to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issue 
to date the company has contacted its significant suppliers and financial institutions and has received assurances of year compliance from several of those contacted 
most of the suppliers with the company are under no contractual obligation to provide such information to the company 
the company is taking steps with respect to new supplier agreements to ensure that the suppliers products and internal systems are year compliant 
while the company currently expects that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems  delays in the implementation of new information systems  or a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the company s systems and in the systems of its suppliers  customers and financial institutions could have material adverse consequences  including delays in the delivery or sale of products 
therefore  the company is developing contingency plans for continuing operations in the event such problems arise 
the company expects to have a contingency plan developed by september item a
