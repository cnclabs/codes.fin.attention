the following table summarizes market price fluctuations on the primary raw materials used by the company in manufacturing its products market price ranges per pound year ended december  cobalt grade to to nickel to to copper to to the company generally passes through to its customers increases and decreases in raw material prices by increasing and decreasing  respectively  the prices of its products 
cobalt market prices per pound dropped from approximately at september   to by december   and have since rebounded to approximately during the first quarter of when raw material prices decrease precipitously  the company s lifo inventory value may exceed the value at which the inventory can be sold ie  lifo inventory costs may exceed market 
consequently  the company evaluates its inventory carrying value to state it at the lower of cost or market 
at december   no adjustment to carrying value was needed  as the market value of the inventory exceeded lifo cost 
pounds of product sold by the company were million pounds during compared to million pounds in the increase in carboxylate products sold was primarily the result of the acquisition of dussek campbell limited dussek and increases in sales of cobalt carboxylates and pvc additives 
in the salts category  the increase was due to the acquisition of fidelity as overall nickel salt volumes  excluding fidelity  declined due primarily to a decrease in the sales of lower margin nickel sulfate products 
the increase in physical volume of powder products reflects the introduction of tungsten powders during and overall growth in cobalt extra fine powders  which offset a decrease in copper powder volumes related to slowness in the aerospace and agricultural equipment business areas 
gross profit increased to million in  a increase from the improvement in gross profit was primarily the result of the acquisitions of fidelity and dussek  an increased contribution from higher value added products  and higher physical volume excluding the decrease in lower margin nickel sulfate products 
cost of products sold decreased to of net sales for the year ended from of net sales in primarily because of lower cobalt  nickel and copper market prices  which declined more rapidly than selling prices  improved product mix and the acquisitions of fidelity and dussek 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in from of net sales in  due to the acquisition of fidelity and its relatively higher selling  administrative  and research expenses per dollar of sales  and to the decline in net sales resulting from lower cobalt  nickel and copper prices

net income for was million  an increase of million from  primarily due to the aforementioned factors 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company s net working capital increased by approximately million 
this increase was primarily the result of provisional payments made on zambia consolidated copper mines limited cobalt copper concentrate  purchased in the fourth quarter  see note h and approximately million in acquisition working capital 
capital expenditures increased in  primarily due to expansion at various plant facilities and the smelter construction project in lumbumbashi  democratic republic of congo 
these increased cash needs were funded through additional borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility  an equity offering and cash generated by operations 
in july   the company sold  shares of common stock in a public offering 
a portion of the net proceeds of the offering  in the amount of million  was used to pay down a portion of the debt incurred in connection with the acquisitions 
in january   the company s revolving credit facility was revised to increase available credit to million to finance the purchase of cobalt copper concentrate  and to expand its sources of capital by adding three new institutions 
subject to several limitations in its credit facilities  the company may incur additional borrowings under this facility to finance working capital and certain capital expenditures  including  without limitation  the purchase of additional raw materials 
the company believes that it will have sufficient cash generated by operations and through its credit facility to provide for its future working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to pay quarterly dividends on its common stock  subject to the board s discretion 
in february   the board of directors authorized an increase in quarterly dividends to 
per share 
the company has ongoing capital expenditure programs to improve its processing technology and plant and equipment  and to expand capacity to accommodate future growth 
the company anticipates that capital spending  exclusive of acquisitions or joint ventures  will approximate million for although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are transacted in us dollars  liabilities for us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in currency prices will affect the company s operating results and net income see page international operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities 
the primary raw materials used by the company in manufacturing its products are cobalt  nickel and copper 
while nickel and copper are worldwide commodities and generally available  cobalt availability can be more uncertain 
the company s supply of cobalt has historically been sourced primarily from the democratic republic of congo  australia  finland and zambia 
although the company has never experienced a material shortage of cobalt  production problems and political and civil instability in certain supplier countries may affect the supply and market price of cobalt 
if a substantial interruption should occur in supply from a primary source  there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain as much cobalt from other sources as would be necessary to satisfy the company s requirements at prices comparable to its current arrangements 
the company attempts to mitigate changes in prices and availability by maintaining adequate inventories and long term supply relationships with a variety of producers 
the cost of raw materials fluctuates due to both actual and perceived changes in supply and demand 
generally  the company is able to pass through to its customers increases and decreases in raw material prices by increasing or decreasing  respectively  the prices of its products 
the degree of profitability of the company principally depends on the company s ability to maintain the differential between its product prices and product costs 
substantial  sustained reductions in the price of raw materials  particularly cobalt  could also result in the company s inventory being written down to market value see results of operations  compared to 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company predominantly utilizes us dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of the company s borrowings are in variable rate instruments 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the variable rate instruments to fixed rate contracts over typically a three year period 
there is an inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements see note d 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of the company s long term debt 
expected maturity date december  fair thereafter total value thousands of dollars long term debt  including current portion fixed rate    average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate in addition to the united states  the company has manufacturing and other facilities in canada  europe and asia pacific  and markets its products worldwide 
although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are transacted in us dollars  liabilities for us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in currency prices may affect the company s operating results and net income see page international operations 
year based on ongoing reviews of the company s systems  the company presently believes that with modifications to existing computer software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems to its normal business activities 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the following table summarizes the company s progress on these year phases  with respect to the nature and potential effects of the year on information it and non it systems  the status of the company s progress in becoming year ready for both it and non it systems  including estimated timetable for completion of each phase  and third parties and their exposure to the year resolution phases exposure type assessment remediation testing implementation information systems complete at expected completion date apr jun jul sep non information systems production and manufacturing systems complete at expected completion date sep jun jul sep products complete at n a n a n a expected completion date sep third parties system interface complete at n a n a n a expected completion date apr other material exposures complete at n a n a n a expected completion date sep this project will be completed using a combination of existing internal and external resources 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
as of december   approximately million had been incurred 
of the total project cost  approximately 
million is attributable to a new software purchase  which has been capitalized 
the remaining million  which is being expensed as incurred  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of the year program  but does not believe that lack of completion would materially disrupt its operations 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion in april and determine whether such a plan is necessary
