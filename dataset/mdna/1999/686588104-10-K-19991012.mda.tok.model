these expenditures include site preparation  roads  water and sewer lines  impact fees and earthwork  as well as the construction costs of the homes and amenities 
the company s sources of capital include funds derived from operations  sales of assets and various borrowings  most of which are secured 
at june   the company had approximately  available to be drawn under existing secured revolving and construction loans for planned development expenditures 
the company believes that the funds generated from operations and financing commitments from commercial lenders will provide the company with sufficient capital to meet its operating needs through fiscal the company has continued its ongoing land acquisition efforts during fiscal during this period  the company acquired  in its existing markets  seven additional parcels of land totaling approximately residential lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  marketing activities had commenced on a majority of these communities as of june  and the remaining communities will commence marketing activities in fiscal as of june   the company had contracted to purchase fifteen additional parcels of land  in its existing markets  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  these purchase agreements are subject to due diligence review and are contingent upon the receipt of governmental approvals 
the company expects to utilize purchase money mortgages  secured financings and existing capital resources to finance these acquisitions 
the company anticipates completing a majority of these acquisitions during fiscal and overview of operations the tables included in item business summarize the company s revenues  new orders and backlog data for the year ended june  with comparable data for fiscal and new orders for fiscal increased by approximately to  on units compared to  on units during fiscal the increase in new orders can be attributed to adequate available financing for home buyers as a result of the overall favorable economic climate throughout the region in which the company sells homes 
in addition  the company facilitated such growth by the opening of new communities in hunterdon  somerset and burlington counties in new jersey  and bucks and chester counties in pennsylvania 
the average price per unit of new orders increased due to an increase in the number and percentage of highly priced single family homes sold in fiscal compared to fiscal single family homes sold in fiscal accounted for approximately of total unit sales compared with approximately during fiscal in addition  the average unit sales price increased for the majority of communities open during fiscal compared with the same units offered for sale in fiscal the dollar backlog at june  increased approximately to  on homes  as compared to the backlog at june  of  on homes 
the company s continued geographic expansion with its new communities  coupled with favorable economic conditions and consumer sentiment  resulted in the increased backlog level 
the company anticipates delivering substantially all of its backlog units during fiscal inflation inflation can have a significant impact on the company s liquidity 
rising costs of land  materials  labor  interest and administrative costs have generally been recoverable in prior years through increased selling prices 
however  there is no assurance the company will be able to continue to increase prices to cover the effects of inflation in the future 
year the company began assessing its year yk compliance issues at the beginning of fiscal and at that time determined that its primary internal computer hardware and software were not yk compliant 
subsequently  the company determined that it would be more cost efficient to install a new yk compliant software package than to modify the existing software package 
during fiscal  the company contracted to purchase a new software package  including several specific enhancements to modify the software to meet the company s needs 
in addition  during fiscal  the company upgraded its primary computer hardware system and installed the base software package of its new computer system for testing 
the company then began intensive testing of the new base software package 
at the same time  the company began working closely with the software vendor to complete the specifications for its required enhancements to the software 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the enhancements were completed and the company completed its testing of the base software and the modifications 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completely converted to the new enhanced yk compliant software package 
through june   the company has incurred approximately  in connection with yk readiness  of which approximately  has been capitalized in connection with the purchase of new software and hardware and will be amortized over its useful life 
the remainder was expensed as incurred 
cost incurred includes new hardware and software  consulting fees  internal staff costs and other expenses 
the company expects to incur nominal additional expenditures on this project through the end of calendar the company is also investigating the yk compliance status of its vendors  subcontractors and suppliers through the company s own internal vendor compliance effort 
this investigation began in early fiscal and will continue through calendar as the company continues to assess the yk readiness of its vendors  subcontractors and suppliers 
any non response or inadequate response from such business partner may cause the company to re evaluate its relationship with such partner 
since the company does not rely on any individual vendor  subcontractor or supplier for a significant portion of its operations  the potential impact of yk non compliance risks by any individual vendor  subcontractor or supplier is not expected to have any material effect on the company 
while the company believes it is taking all appropriate steps to achieve internal yk compliance  any potential future business interruptions  costs  damages or losses related thereto  are also dependent upon the yk compliance of third parties 
in the event that the company or a combination of the company s vendors  subcontractors or suppliers experience disruptions due to the yk issue  the company s operations could be adversely affected 
the yk issue is universal and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
consequently  no assurance can be given that complete yk compliance can be achieved without significant additional costs 
forward looking statement the company s estimates of completion dates for its yk readiness program represent management s best estimates 
these estimates are based upon many assumptions  including the availability of external resources to assist with systems remediation and replacement efforts  key third party suppliers  vendors and customers being yk compliant 
if any of the assumptions ultimately prove to have been incorrect  the completion dates set forth above could be substantially and adversely affected
