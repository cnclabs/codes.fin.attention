item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s results of operations are affected by numerous external factors  such as general economic and political conditions  competition  and steel pricing and availability  and work stoppages by automotive manufacturers 
the company s and results include the results of the company s southeastern operation southeastern  the net assets of which were acquired effective june  southeastern has historically operated as a metals toll processor  and is located near atlanta  georgia 
additionally  effective june   the company s consolidated balance sheet reflects the acquired net assets of jnt precision machining  inc jnt  a machining center located in mcconnellsburg  pennsylvania 
jnt s results of operations are included in the company s results commencing in the third quarter of olympic sells a broad range of products  many of which have different gross margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross margin 
accordingly  the company s overall gross margin is affected by product mix and the amount of processing performed  as well as volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
the company performs toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by its lafayette steel and southeastern operations 
toll processing generally results in lower selling prices and gross margin dollars per ton but higher gross margin percentages than the company s historical direct sales 
the company s financial statements include the results of its three joint ventures olympic continental resources ocr  a company formed in january to buy  sell and trade ferrous and non ferrous metals and alternate iron products to steel mills and scrap processors  olympic laser processing olp  a company formed in april to process laser welded sheet steel blanks for the automotive industry  and trumark steel processing tsp  a company formed in december  to support the flat rolled steel requirements of the automotive industry as a minority business enterprise mbe 
the company s interest in ocr  interest in olp and interest in tsp are accounted for under the equity method 
the company guarantees portions of outstanding debt under all three of the joint venture companies bank credit facilities 
as of december   olympic guaranteed of ocr s million of outstanding debt on a joint and several basis  and of olp s million and of tsp s million of outstanding debt on a several basis 
ocr generates a significant portion of its revenue from one of its joint venture partners  atlas iron processors  inc atlas or affiliates of atlas 
as a result  ocr maintains significant receivable balances with atlas 
ocr s receivable from atlas totaled approximately million at december   which represented of ocr s total accounts receivable balances at that date 
the company believes that ocr s receivable from atlas is uncollectible  and therefore wrote down its entire million investment in ocr at december  the olp and tsp ventures are still in startup and do not have significant receivables from joint venture partners 
olp has constructed a new facility and has initially equipped it with two laser welding lines 
prototyping has begun on both welding lines and production has begun on one line 
the company expects olp start up costs to continue through  as both welding lines are not expected to be operating at full capacity until the beginning of tsp obtained certification as an mbe from the michigan minority business development council in december  and anticipates ramping up to full production in the second quarter of start up costs for both olp and tsp have been expensed as incurred 
financing costs include interest expense on debt and costs associated with the company s accounts receivable securitization program financing costs 
interest rates paid by the company under its credit agreement are generally based on prime or libor plus a premium the premium determined quarterly  which varies based on the company s operating performance and financial leverage 
receivable securitization costs are based on commercial paper rates calculated on the amount of receivables sold 
the company sells certain products internationally  primarily in mexico and puerto rico 
all international sales and payments are made in united states dollars 
these sales historically involve the company s direct representation of steel producers and may be covered by letters of credit or trade receivable insurance 
typically  international sales are more transactional in nature with lower gross margins than domestic sales 
domestic steel producers generally supply domestic customers before meeting foreign demand  particularly during periods of supply constraints 
four separate collective bargaining units represent approximately of the company s hourly plant personnel at its minneapolis and lafayette steel facilities 
in september  the two collective bargaining agreements at lafayette were renewed to july and july  respectively  and the agreement covering personnel at the minneapolis coil facility was renewed to september  the minneapolis plate processing facility agreement expires on march  the company has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its relationship with its employees is good 
because the company conducts its operations generally on the basis of short term orders  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses before asset writedown asset write down operating income loss interest and receivable securitization expense income loss before taxes income taxes net income loss compared to tons sold decreased to  thousand in from  thousand in tons sold in include  thousand from direct sales and thousand from toll processing  compared with  thousand from direct sales and thousand from toll processing in the increase in tolling tons is attributable to southeastern  offset by a reduction at lafayette attributable to the impact of the general motors gm strike in the strike 
the decrease in direct tons is primarily attributable to lafayette  again impacted by the strike  and a decrease in international sales to mexico 
net sales decreased by million  or  to million from million in average selling prices declined due to market conditions which resulted in decreased prices for steel  and an increased proportion of tolling sales in international sales declined million in  as a result of declining participation in the mexican market 
the company s sales to gm decreased million  or in  due to the impact of the strike  as well as a continued decline in the company s participation with gm 
the company s sales to suppliers of gm also declined in the second half of due to the strike 
approximately of the company s net sales were made to customers in the automotive industry  compared to approximately in as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased to from last year 
the increase reflects the impact of enhanced margins from the company s non automotive sales  lower international sales  and an increase in the proportion of tolling sales in operating expenses totaled million in  and included a one time asset write down charge of million 
the charge consisted of million to write off goodwill and write down certain fixed assets at lafayette  and million to write down the company s investment in ocr 
the lafayette charge was taken in accordance with accounting regulations which require long lived assets such as goodwill and fixed assets to be written down to fair market value when circumstances indicate that their carrying values are impaired 
the changing dynamics in the automotive marketplace over the past months  including gm s introduction of new processing capabilities at its regional distribution center  adversely impacted lafayette s cash flows and operating earnings 
these dynamics not only resulted in a loss of sales volume to gm but also left a portion of lafayette s processing equipment non productive and thereby non competitive in the automotive marketplace 
the company disposed of four pieces of processing equipment in the third quarter of  and developed a plan to dispose of the remaining non competitive equipment in accordingly  the company recorded a charge of million to write down certain processing equipment and other fixed assets  and million to write off all goodwill at lafayette 
separately  the ocr investment write down was required because  in olympic s judgement  ocr s entire million receivable from its largest customer  atlas  is considered uncollectible 
the company is presently reviewing its strategic alternatives for its future scrap trading plans 
excluding the asset write down  operating expenses increased to million from million 
on a per ton basis  operating expenses increased to from in as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses before the asset write down increased to in from in the increases are primarily due to lower sales volume  lower average selling prices  start up costs  increased spending on information technology  including yk costs  and thousand of non recurring costs associated with the disposition of fixed assets 
start up costs included in operating expenses in totaled million compared to thousand in these costs primarily relate to the million temper mill and plate processing facility in bettendorf  iowa the iowa facility and the new tube mill in cleveland 
start up costs for the iowa facility are expected to continue in the first quarter of  as the facility becomes fully operational 
income from the ocr joint venture in totaled versus thousand in olympic s share of olp and tsp start up costs totaled thousand and thousand  respectively in  and thousand and thousand  respectively in financing costs decreased to million in from million in average borrowings outstanding in decreased approximately million  primarily as a result of lower inventory levels in  offset by increased borrowings on the iowa facility term loan 
interest costs associated with the iowa facility term loan were capitalized through december the company s overall effective borrowing rate increased to in from in the premium for averaged  compared to

in  the income tax benefit approximated of pretax loss  compared to income tax expense recorded at of pretax income in the decrease in the tax rate between years was attributable to the asset write down charge 
the company expects its income tax rate to approximate of pretax income 
net loss totaled million or

compared to tons sold increased to  thousand in from  thousand in tons sold in included  thousand from direct sales and thousand from toll processing  compared with  thousand from direct sales and thousand from toll processing in all of the company s domestic operations achieved increases in tons sold in substantially all of the increase in tolling tons was attributable to southeastern 
net sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in average selling prices declined  primarily due to an increased proportion of tolling sales in  and a decline in direct average selling prices related to stainless steel products 
international sales were less than of net sales in both and as a percentage of net sales  gross margin decreased to from in the decrease was primarily the result of market conditions  which did not allow increased prices for steel to be fully recovered in the selling cycle 
on a per ton basis  operating expenses decreased to from in as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased to in from in the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to the impact of lower average selling prices and increased warehouse and depreciation expense in the increase in warehouse and depreciation expense primarily related to the southeastern acquisition  the cleveland temper mill facility  completion of the lafayette plant expansion  and continued investment in management information systems 
income from the ocr joint venture in totaled thousand 
olympic s share of olp and tsp start up costs in totaled thousand and thousand  respectively 
financing costs increased to million in from million in average borrowings outstanding in increased primarily as a result of higher inventory levels  the acquisition of southeastern  and capital expenditures 
overall effective borrowing rates decreased to in from in lower premiums as a result of the stock offering favorably impacted effective borrowing rates for costs associated with the accounts receivable securitization program increased slightly in as a result of higher commercial paper rates 
income before taxes totaled million in compared to million in income taxes computed on earnings represented of pretax income or million versus or million in net income totaled million or 
per share in  compared to million or per share in as a result of the stock offering  weighted average shares outstanding increased from million in to million in liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital requirement is to fund its growth  including strategic acquisitions and joint ventures  the purchase and upgrading of processing equipment and services  the construction and upgrading of related facilities  and additional working capital requirements 
the company uses cash generated from operations  long term debt obligations  equity offerings  and leasing transactions to fund these requirements 
historically  the company has used revolving credit borrowings under its bank credit facility and proceeds from its receivable securitization program to finance its working capital requirements 
net cash from operating activities primarily represents net income plus non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and start up costs income from joint ventures  as well as changes in working capital 
during  million of net cash was provided from operating activities  consisting of million of cash generated from net income and non cash charges and million of cash from working capital components 
working capital at december  decreased million from the end of the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in inventory and a million decrease in accounts receivable 
as of december   million of eligible receivables were sold under the company s accounts receivable securitization program  compared to million at december  the amount of trade receivables sold by the company typically changes monthly depending upon the level of defined eligible receivables available for sale at each month end 
net cash used for investing activities in totaled million  primarily consisting of million spent for the iowa facility  which became operational late in the fourth quarter of the company also made final payments on its new tube mill in cleveland and new cut to length line in detroit  which were both installed during the first quarter of the cut to length line became fully operational in the second quarter of  while the tube mill reached rated capacity in the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company also exercised a million early buyout option of equipment previously leased at its minneapolis coil processing facility  and completed a million   square foot facility expansion and cut to length line upgrade project at its southeastern operation 
jnt is operating from its current facility in mcconnellsburg until it is relocated to a new  square foot facility being constructed in nearby chambersburg  pennsylvania 
olympic plans to spend approximately million  of which million was spent in to construct the facility  relocate existing machining equipment  and purchase new plate processing equipment 
the new facility is projected to be operational by the end of the third quarter of the company expects to finance the chambersburg project with the proceeds from industrial revenue bonds 
the company s capital spending plan approximates million  consisting primarily of million to complete the chambersburg project and million for additional laser plate processing equipment 
cash flows used from financing activities primarily consists of net borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement and term loan draws for the iowa facility  offset by scheduled payments under other existing long term debt agreements 
the company s bank credit agreement was amended in march the credit facility 
the amendment increased the iowa term loan from million to million to accommodate additional spending for plate processing equipment at the facility  extended the agreement expiration date to june   waived an interest coverage covenant violation at december  and amended future interest coverage requirements  and added a basis point pricing tier to the premium schedule 
the credit facility also includes letter of credit commitments  which totaled approximately million at december   and contains restrictive covenants which require minimum net worth levels  maintenance of certain financial ratios and limitations on capital expenditures 
the company is in compliance with all covenants after obtaining the interest coverage waiver 
as of december   approximately million was available under the company s revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities  and million was borrowed under the million iowa term loan 
the company believes that funds available under the credit facility  other credit and financing agreements and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to provide the company with the liquidity necessary to fund its anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements over the next months 
capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
in connection with its internal and external expansion strategies  the company may from time to time seek additional funds to finance other new facilities and equipment  acquisitions and significant improvements to processing equipment to respond to customers demands 
effects of inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of personnel  processing equipment  purchased steel  and borrowings under the various credit agreements 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its operating income over the periods presented 
however  it has and could have a material effect on interest expense based on inflation s impact on amounts borrowed and prime and libor borrowing rates 
conversely  when raw material prices decline  as in  customer demands for lower prices have and could result in lower selling prices and  as the company uses existing steel inventory  lower margins 
changing steel prices therefore could adversely affect the company s net sales  gross margins and net income 
year compliance the year yk problem refers to computer applications using only the last two digits to refer to a year rather than all four digits 
as a result  these applications could fail or create erroneous results if they recognize as the year rather than the year  or if they will not recognize as a legitimate year value 
olympic recognizes the significance of these issues and also understands that it is affected by the yk problem 
the company has had a project in place since the second half of to deal with these issues 
olympic has budgeted approximately million to remediate its affected systems 
this funding has come from normal mis budgets during the years through the company is currently on budget and on schedule for the project 
the project has been staffed by in house personnel with the exception of the plant equipment assessment  which was carried out by outside experts 
the project consists of awareness  inventory  planning  assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation phases 
in addressing the yk issues  olympic has taken initiatives in three general areas i information technology it and communication systems  ii non it systems and iii related third party issues 
the following is a summary of these programs and their current status 
it and communication systems since late  olympic  in support of its long range strategic plans  has significantly upgraded and continues to upgrade its information technology and communication systems 
this upgrade includes migration to new mid range host systems and to client server based systems  upgraded personal computers pcs  upgraded pc software standardized on windows and microsoft office suite  lotus notes email  workgroup and intranet software  local area networks lans  wide area networks wans  and network integration of internet and remote access systems 
a by product of these endeavors is that a large portion of the company s it and non voice communication systems  and many of its voice communication systems are now yk compliant 
olympic s exceptions to yk compliance at this time are i integrated business application software 
olympic maintains three mid range host systems running essentially custom application software specific to the service center and outside processor industry 
the three host operating systems have been certified by their vendors to be yk compliant 
the three systems run different application software as a result of acquisitions and unique industry requirements at their locations 
all source code has been remediated 
the company is now in the testing phase to assure proper handling of date logic 
this testing is expected to be complete by april  ii new payroll h r system 
this new system was acquired as a routine business upgrade to meet expanded business requirements 
it is currently in the implementation phase 
the new system is represented by the vendor to be yk compliant 
the system is expected to be live by the end of the third quarter olympic s existing payroll system is expected to be yk compliant in as a contingency 
iii network hardware and software 
the company s network operating systems require patches from the vendor to be yk compliant 
these are being installed currently 
certain network hardware components require replacement 
these are being currently installed 
this work is expected to be complete by march  iv voice mail system 
the company is awaiting an upgrade from its vendor which is supposed to be available in april v other office equipment 
other intelligent office equipment operating in a stand alone mode such as fax machines  copiers  etc 
may not be yk compliant 
these are not considered critical and will be addressed in the second quarter of in all cases  the company has obtained representations from its hardware and software suppliers that its installed versions of their products are yk compliant 
these representations have been in the form of direct written assurances or material posted on the vendor s web sites 
the company is relying on these assurances in order to satisfy itself of compliance and to prepare assurances for its trading partners and other third parties 
non it systems the company s internal non it systems consist mainly of building air management systems  security and fire control systems  safety systems  equipment operating and control systems  electrical and natural gas systems  and equipment such as lift trucks  cranes  etc 
these have been assessed at all locations by third party consultants specializing in yk compliance and remediation planning 
olympic has received assurances from most of its equipment and plant system vendors that their products are compliant 
the company is still awaiting responses from a few equipment vendors 
results to date suggest that there is minimal exposure with any non it systems 
remediation  if necessary  is expected to be complete by march   pending vendor responses to inquiries 
third parties olympic has third party relationships with hundreds of large oem customers  steel suppliers and suppliers of financial and outsourced investor and employee information and management services 
many of these third parties are publicly traded corporations subject to disclosure requirements 
olympic is presently engaged in ongoing discussions and evaluations of these third parties yk readiness  while simultaneously advising them of olympic s readiness 
olympic intends to monitor yk disclosures in sec filings of these third parties in olympic has sent questionnaires to over  critical and non critical vendors inquiring of their yk status and plans 
most of these vendors are not critical to the company s on going operation 
the response rate was only about 
most of those who have responded understood the issue and are taking appropriate action 
few are compliant yet 
olympic intends to contact critical vendors individually during the second quarter of and continue to actively track their yk status throughout the year 
the company has handled many inquiries from its customers about its yk status and plans  and has responded to all of those inquiries 
major customers report having had yk compliance programs running for at least one to two years and indicate that their systems that interact with olympic are or will be compliant for yk 
based on discussions with these customers  assessment of the customers capability  and long time customer operating practices  olympic believes that these key customers will be yk compliant in all material matters affecting olympic 
olympic will continue to monitor its customers yk compliance 
olympic is also in ongoing discussion with key suppliers of outsourced services including  but not limited to  stock transfer  debt servicing  banking  collection and disbursements  and benefit programs 
at this time  olympic has concluded that all material suppliers of these services are or will be yk compliant by the middle of calendar olympic will continue to monitor their yk compliance 
with the exception of steel products purchased from the large aforementioned suppliers  other outside steel processing services  packaging supplies such as lumber and banding  and miscellaneous supplies are purchased from numerous small suppliers who olympic believes are able to manually execute their business and are readily replaceable 
olympic has concluded there is no material risk of being unable to procure these needed raw materials or processing services 
the specific yk it and communication system remediation tasks previously outlined are being accomplished by in house mis and user personnel whose costs are recorded as normal operating expense 
the it system software upgrades are being executed under ongoing maintenance and support agreements with software vendors  and the upgrades to certain hardware are being executed under similar arrangements with hardware vendors 
network hardware component replacement costs  along with copiers and fax machine replacement costs  are not expected to be material 
olympic is not yet in a position to estimate the cost of non it system and third party compliance issues  but has no reason to believe  based upon its evaluations done to date  that such costs  in the aggregate  would be material 
all yk compliance costs are included in normal it budgets 
some previously planned it projects have been deferred to allow proper handling of the yk issues 
yk risks there are several classes of risk and sources of risk that olympic faces in connection with the yk problem 
i economic infrastructure risks 
the company is dependent on public utilities for electrical power  natural gas  and telephone network services  and would be seriously impacted by outages of these services for an extended period 
the company has sufficient backup electrical generation capacity  powered by a natural gas generator  to support its it and communications systems at its corporate location 
however  this would not serve its remote locations and would not provide for operation of its plant facilities 
olympic is dependent on common carriers for transportation of incoming steel as well as outbound customer shipments  and would be seriously impacted if these services were disrupted for an extended period 
ii accounting system risks 
there is a possibility that the company s accounting systems would be materially disrupted 
the company considers this risk as small and manual procedures are in place as a backup 
also  there is a small risk that payroll services would be disrupted 
again  this risk is considered small since the company processes its own payroll and expects to have a compliant system 
however  olympic does transmit weekly ach direct deposit information to a bank via a dial up file transfer 
the bank assures the company that this process will not be affected on their end 
iii overseas risks 
olympic purchases some steel overseas to supplement domestic sources 
this is not a major component of sourcing  but it may cause some difficulty in some locations or for some customers 
iv key personnel risks 
there is some risk that key people might not be available for remediation projects  or in the critical period immediately after the beginning of the year olympic believes that this risk is small and a swat team is planned to be on site or available at all locations to deal with unexpected problems 
v cost escalation risks 
there is a small risk that testing will disclose new problems which will require substantial time or expense to remediate 
since these are unknown at this time  the company cannot estimate what the impact will be 
vi project risks 
the principal risks to olympic relating to the completion of its compliance conversion efforts related to its it and communications systems are a inability to retain key staff 
at this point  however  this is believed to be only a small risk 
b failure to successfully complete remediation and testing of application code in the three data centers 
if this should occur  olympic has standard manual procedures in place for carrying out normal order processing  production  and shipping in the event of computer outage 
these procedures could be used for a duration of about three days without great impact on the business 
olympic believes that adequate replacements for non compliant network components  pc s  copiers and fax machines are commercially available at reasonable prices and in good supply 
olympic believes that adequate time and resources are available to remediate these areas as needed 
the principal risks to olympic relating to non it systems are failures in control systems for significant machinery or facility systems 
these risks are presently being evaluated based on the assessment of the individual plant systems 
until this evaluation is completed  olympic has no basis to form an estimate of risks 
based on the work to date  the company believes that the risk of failure of these systems is small 
the principal risks to olympic in its relationship with third parties are i failure of third party systems used to conduct such third party s business including customers  steel suppliers and suppliers of financial and outsourced investor and employee information and management services  and ii failure to implement compliant edi systems with key customers 
olympic s systems are expected to be compliant  and its edi van sterling commerce is also expected to be compliant 
based on yk compliance work done to date  olympic believes its key steel suppliers and customers are currently yk compliant or will be yk compliant in all material respects and that service suppliers will be yk compliant or can be replaced within an acceptable time frame 
contingency plans olympic intends to develop detailed contingency plans during the latter part of the second quarter of  after the results of the assessment  remediation in progress  and testing have been ascertained 
olympic plans to create a swat team of key personnel at all locations and those people will be on site at each location during the first critical hours of the new year 
the team will rehearse a plan for assessing critical systems and coordinating responses 
standard procedures and checklists will be prepared to assist in this assessment 
olympic has designated friday  december  and monday  january  as company holidays 
this will provide additional time to assess the specific situation at each olympic location  as well as to assess the general situation in the country as a whole 
all olympic locations and departments have existing current manual procedures for operation which are used for normal brief outages of it and communications systems 
it is expected that these procedures would be used to cover brief periods while program code or other components are repaired 
other actions being considered include adding selective system redundancies and backup vendors 
olympic s description of its yk compliance issue is based upon information obtained by olympic through evaluations of olympic s it and communication systems  and customer and supplier yk compliance assurances 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to address the yk issues for all of its software and applications in a timely manner or that it will not encounter unexpected difficulties or significant expenses relating to adequately addressing the yk issue 
if olympic or the major customers or suppliers with whom olympic does business fail to address adequately the yk issues  or olympic fails to successfully integrate or convert its computer systems generally  olympic s business or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company is unable to provide assurances for eventualities not known in advance  or for multiple or simultaneous occurrences beyond our capability to handle with the resources available
