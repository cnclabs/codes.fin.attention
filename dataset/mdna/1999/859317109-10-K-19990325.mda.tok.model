management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes appearing elsewhere in this report 
all dollar amounts presented in the tables are in thousands  except per share data 
results of operations summary net income for was  an increase of  or over the  earned in the results of were  or higher than the  reported in basic earnings per share on net income amounted to  and for the years ended  and basic earnings per share were computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding  which were   and  for  and diluted earnings per share on net income amounted to  and for the years ending  and the weighted number of common shares and dilutive potential common stock used in calculating the diluted earnings per share were   and  for  and figures prior to were restated to reflect a stock dividend paid in june  return on average total assets was in compared to in and in return on average stockholders equity was  in compared to in and in growth in earning assets was the primary factor contributing to the increased earnings in and as of december   earning assets were approximately million compared to million at december   and million at december  average earning assets for increased over million  to approximately million  up from the prior year 
similarly  in  average earning assets increased over million  up from the current year increase  as well as the increase in  was primarily due to increases in both loans and investments 
average interest bearing liabilities increased over million or in  compared to an increase of nearly million  or in the increase in average earning assets exceeded the increase in average interest bearing liabilities in both and provision for loan losses decreased to  in from  in the provision in was  non interest income increased  in  compared to an increase of  in non interest expenses increased  or in compared to an increase of  or in over the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets and on non interest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the level of inflation over the last few years has been declining 
during  and  the federal deposit insurance corporation estimates that the average regular annual deposit insurance assessment will be about cents per of deposits for bif deposits and cents per of deposits for saif deposits 
individual institution s assessments will continue to vary according to their capital and management ratings 
as always  the fdic will be able to raise the assessments as necessary to maintain the funds at their target capital ratios provided by law 
based on the above legislation  the bank experienced an increase in the fdic assessment in and over the passage of the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of and the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act has not yet  but may have a significant impact upon the corporation 
the key provisions pertain to interstate banking and interstate branching as well as a reduction in the regulatory burden on the banking industry 
since september  bank holding companies may acquire banks in other states without regard to state law 
in addition  banks could merge with other banks in another state beginning in june states may adopt laws preventing interstate branching but  if so  no out of state bank can establish a branch in such state and no bank in such state may branch outside the state 
pennsylvania amended the provisions of its banking code to authorize full interstate banking and branching under pennsylvania law and to facilitate the operations of interstate banks in pennsylvania 
as a result of legal and industry changes  management predicts that consolidation will continue as the financial services industry strives for greater cost efficiencies and market share 
management believes that such consolidation may enhance its competitive position as a community bank 
there are numerous proposals before congress to modify the financial services industry and the way commercial banks operate 
however  it is difficult to determine at this time what effect such provisions may have until they are enacted into law 
except as specifically described above  management believes that the effect of the provisions of the aforementioned legislation on the liquidity  capital resources and results of operations of the corporation will be immaterial 
management is not aware of any other current specific recommendations by regulatory authorities or proposed legislation  which if they were implemented  would have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity  capital resources or results of operations  although the general cost of compliance with numerous and multiple federal and state laws and regulations does have and in the future may have a negative impact on the corporation s results of operations

management has initiated an enterprise wide program to prepare the corporation s computer systems and applications for the year in january  the corporation began converting its computer systems to be year ready 
on december   approximately of the corporation s systems were ready  with all systems expected to be ready by june of the corporation continues to evaluate appropriate courses of corrective action  including replacement of certain systems whose associated costs would be recorded as assets and amortized 
the total cost of the project is being funded through operating cash flows 
accordingly  the corporation does not expect the amounts required to be expensed over the next year to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
on february   the corporation entered into an agreement to acquire northeast bancorp  inc  the parent company of first national bank of north east  based in maryland 
northeast bancorp is an million bank holding company for first national bank of north east  with branches located in cecil county  maryland 
under the terms of the agreement  northeast bancorp shareholders will receive shares of sterling financial corporation common stock for each share of northeast bancorp s common stock in a tax free exchange 
the purchase  which is subject to regulatory approval  will give sterling financial its first banking presence outside of pennsylvania 
the transaction is expected to be completed in mid and the acquisition is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
first national bank of north east will continue to operate as a separate bank after the acquisition 
aside from those matters described above  management does not believe that there are any trends or uncertainties which would have a material impact on future operating results  liquidity or capital resources nor is it aware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which if they were to be implemented would have such an effect 
net interest income the primary component of the corporation s net earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
for presentation and analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis 
for purposes of calculating yields on tax exempt interest income  the taxable equivalent adjustment equates tax exempt interest rates to taxable interest rates as noted in table adjustments are made using a statutory federal tax rate of for  and table presents average balances  taxable equivalent interest income and expense and the yields earned or paid on these assets and liabilities

management s judgement is based on the evaluation of individual loans and their overall risk characteristics  past loan loss experience  and other relevant factors 
net charge offs amounted to  in   in and  in gross charge offs for were  a decline from the  reported in the decline in the provision for loan losses  gross and net charge offs was a result of improvement in credit quality  particularly in the consumer portfolio

no mortgages were acquired from third parties  nor have servicing rights been purchased from third parties 
a low interest rate environment in and  as well as an expansion in mortgage products and services resulted in the increase in volume in and the bank retains mortgage servicing rights on the majority of mortgages originated and sold on the secondary market 
the bank s mortgage servicing portfolio totaled million as of december  compared to million on december  another component of the mortgage banking increase in income was a result of the implementation of fasb  subsequently replaced by fasb  which required that mortgage servicing rights be recognized for their economic value  beginning january  mortgage servicing has an economic value because of future servicing income to be received over the life of the mortgage 
the value of servicing rights is available through third party purchasers in private transactions 
the bank has developed a business relationship with an independent consultant to determine the values of mortgage servicing rights 
in  the amount recognized to income was  mortgage servicing rights are recorded as an asset and recognized directly to income as if the servicing had been sold 
the asset is amortized as a charge to earnings over the estimated servicing life of the associated mortgage 
mortgage servicing assets as of december  and amounted to  and  the market value of all mortgage servicing assets is also determined by the independent consultant

during  and  the average regular annual deposit insurance assessment is estimated to be about cents per of deposits for bif deposits and cents per of deposits for saif deposits 
individual institution s assessments will continue to vary according to their capital and management ratings 
as always  the fdic will be able to raise the assessments as necessary to maintain the funds at their target capital ratios provided by law 
after  bif and saif will share the fico costs equally 
under current estimates  bif and saif assessment bases would each be assessed at the rate of approximately cents per of deposits 
the fico bonds will mature in  ending the interest payment obligation 
the legislation caused the bank to experience an increase of  in the fdic assessment over the assessment 
other operating expenses increased  or in compared to an increase of  in the increase is consistent with rising costs associated with acquiring services covered in this category of expense

the economic conditions within the corporation s market area remained healthy in this is reflected in the unemployment rate for lancaster county  which is the bank s primary market area 
the jobless rate during hovered close to  staying the lowest or second lowest in the state 
the county s unemployment rate has not exceeded since november of lancaster county s unemployment rate has historically been and continues to be one of the lowest among pennsylvania s metropolitan regions 
it also remains well below the average national and state average unemployment figures of and respectively 
the unemployment rate for is expected to mirror that of with little movement in either direction 
lancaster s labor market is expected to remain one of the tightest in the state 
the strength in the employment sector in lancaster county was also seen at the national level 
the us unemployment rate stood at in december compared to in december economists aren t looking for much change this year in the health of labor markets 
indications are that the job market remains robust 
the bank s loan delinquency as a percent of loans outstanding declined during at december   this rate stood at 
compared to 
and 
for december  and december  the average delinquency rate for of 
declined from 
in the decline in the average delinquency rate was primarily attributed to improvement in the consumer portfolio 
the bank  however  is not immune to the significant role that bankruptcies have on losses 
during  the bank s credit card portfolio was sold  which  is believed  will have a positive effect on delinquencies and losses 
while management believes delinquency rates could rise during  expectations are that they will not approach the national delinquency rates 
the

the restructured loans are a series of loans to one borrower involving  there are no commitments to lend additional funds to this borrower in relation to the restructured loans 
a loan is categorized as restructured if the original interest rate on such loan  repayment terms  or both are restructured due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower that otherwise would not have been granted 
in the case of the above referenced loans  the bank is fully secured with real estate 
the loans are current and have performed in accordance with the contractural terms  both prior to and after the restructure 
accrual of interest on these loans continues 
the bank s reserve coverage increased during the year as reserves as a percent of non performing loans increased to compared to for december a portion of the bank s loan portfolio consists of loans to agricultural related borrowers 
these loans consist of loans for a variety of purposes within the industry 
lancaster county continues to be the top agricultural county in the state  leading pennsylvania in production of most crops and all livestock with the exception of sheep 
dairy production remains lancaster county s number one agricultural industry 
the lancaster county dairy industry suffered in due to a steep drop in milk prices 
during the latter part of  milk prices increased significantly 
while the bank continues to pursue quality loans to the dairy industry and the agricultural community in general  it should be noted that these loans are susceptible to a variety of external factors such as adverse climate  economic conditions  etc  in addition to factors common to other industries 
the residential real estate market in for lancaster county enjoyed a strong year 
the county recorded a record year for sales of existing homes 
residential construction contracts  however  increased at a much slower pace  suggesting that the building boom in recent years may be over 
reasonably low interest rates  a continuing strong economy  and minimal inflation accounted for the sales performance 
non residential contracts broke even with  which had experienced a significant increase over most of the bank s business activity is with customers located within the bank s defined market area 
since the majority of the bank s real estate loans are located within this area  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations and increases and decreases in the market value of the real estate collateralizing such loans may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
the bank recognizes that the potential year problems  relating to computers  hardware  microchips  software and additional software applications utilized by the bank s borrowers in their businesses  or by their suppliers  vendors and their customers  may result in unexpected and material adverse changes in borrowers businesses or financial condition 
in order to reduce the potential risk to the bank from its borrowers  the bank has substantially completed an assessment of the year risk posed by its borrowers 
based on this assessment  management does not believe that the year risks from its borrowers pose a material risk or threat to the safety and soundness of the bank 
management believes that the provision for loan losses is adequate to meet the present and forseeable risk characteristics of the loan portfolio including the potential year risks posed by its borrowers 
the general policy has been to cease accruing interest on loans when it is determined that a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of additional interest 
interest income on these loans is only recognized to the extent payments are received 
loans on a nonaccrual status amounted to  at december  compared to  at december  if interest income had been recorded on all such loans for the years indicated  such interest income would been been increased by approximately  and  for and interest income recorded on nonaccrual loans amounted to and  for and potential problem loans are loans which are included as performing loans  but for which possible credit problems of the borrower causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with present repayment terms and which may eventually result in disclosure as a non performing loan 
at december   there were no such loans that had to be disclosed as potential problem loans 
the corporation implemented sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  an amendment of sfas no 
 at the beginning of the bank defined impaired loans as all loans on nonaccrual status and restructured  except those specifically excluded from the scope of sfas no 
 regardless of the credit grade assigned by loan review committee 
all impaired loans are measured using the fair value of the collateral for each loan 
when an impaired loan is measured as less than the recorded investment in the loan  the bank compares the impairment measured to the existing allowance assigned to the loan 
if the impairement is greater than the allowance  the bank adjusts the existing allowance to reflect the greater amount or takes a charge to the provision for loan losses in that amount 
if the impairment is less than the existing allowance for a particular loan  no adjustment to the allowance or to the provision for loan and lease losses is made 
the bank was not required to adjust for impaired loans for the periods indicated 
the following table presents information concerning impaired loans at december gross impaired loans which have allowances   less related allowances for loan losses net impaired loans   the decline in impaired loans is primarily attributed to a reduction in non accrual loans 
a large portion of the impaired loans is attributed to the restructure of a series of loans to one borrower 
a loan is categorized as restructured if the original interest rate on such loan  repayment terms  or both are restructured due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower that otherwise would not have been granted 
in the case of the above referenced loans  the bank is fully secured with real estate 
the loans are current and have performed in accordance with the contractural term  both prior to and after the restructure 
accrual of interest on these loans continues 
at december   there were no concentrations exceeding of loans 
a concentration is defined as amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions

the decline in charge offs was a result of improvement in the consumer loan portfolios 
during  the bank sold its credit card portfolio  which had a positive effect on losses 
personal bankruptcies continue to play a significant role in the losses 
management instituted certain underwriting criteria in and which is believed to also have had a positive effect on losses

of average loans in and  or 
of average loans in the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense reflects the amount deemed appropriate by management to produce an adequate reserve to meet the present risk and inherent risk in the loan portfolio  including the potential year risks posed by its borrowers 
management performs a quarterly assessment of the loan portfolio to determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
the factors considered in this evaluation include  but are not limited to  estimated loan losses identified through a loan review process  general economic conditions  deterioration in pledged collateral  past loan experiences and trends in delinquencies and non accruals 
managment uses available information to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
however  the allowance may be affected in the future based upon changes in the economic conditions and other factors 
while there can be no assurance that material amounts of additional loan loss provisions will not be required in the future  management believes that  based upon information presently available  the amount of the allowance for possible loan losses is adequate 
management has not targeted any specific coverage ratio of nonperforming loans by the allowance for loan losses and the coverage ratio may fluctuate based on loans placed into or removed from nonperforming status

effective december  the board of directors of the corporation terminated the common stock repurchase program that was approved in federal regulatory authorities promulgate risk based capital guidelines applicable to banks and bank holding companies in an effort to make regulatory capital more responsive to the risk exposure related to various categories of assets and off balance sheet items 
these guidelines require that banking organizations meet a minimum risk based capital  define the components of capital  categorize assets into different risk classes and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the components of total capital are called tier and tier capital 
in the case of the bank  tier capital is the shareholders equity and tier capital is the allowance for loan losses 
the risk based capital ratios are computed by dividing the components of capital by risk weighted assets 
risk weighted assets are determined by assigning various levels of risk to different categories of assets and off balance sheet items 
regulatory authorities have decided to exclude the net unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities from the definition of common stockholders equity for regulatory capital purposes 
however  national banks will continue to deduct unrealized losses on equity securities in their computation of tier capital 
therefore  national banks will continue to report the net unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities in the reports of condition and income submitted to federal regulators as required by sfas and the financial reports prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  but will exclude these amounts from calculations of tier capital 
in addition  national banks should use the amortized cost of available for sale debt securities  as opposed to fair value  to determine the average total assets as well as the risk weighted assets used in the calculations of the leverage and risk based capital ratios 
the ratios below and in table reflect the above definition of common stockholders equity which includes common stock  capital surplus and retained earnings  less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values 
the bank s ratios at december   and were above the final risk based capital standards that require tier capital of at least and total risk based capital of of risk weighted assets 
the tier capital ratio at december  was and the total risk based capital ratio was  which exceeds the minimum capital guidelines 
tier capital ratio was and the total risk based capital ratio was at december  while tier capital ratio was and the total risk based capital ratio was at december  at december   the corporation and the bank  exceeded all capital requirements and are considered to be well capitalized 
table capital and performance ratios the following are selected ratios for the years ended december return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average total equity to average assets total equity to assets at year end primary capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity is the ability to meet the requirements of customers for loans and deposit withdrawals in the most economical manner 
some liquidity is ensured by maintaining assets which may be immediately converted into cash at minimal cost 
liquidity from asset categories is provided through cash  noninterest bearing and interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold and marketable investment securities maturing within one year 
investment securities maturing within one year amounted to  at december  compared to  at december  interest bearing deposits with banks were  at december  compared to  at december  federal funds sold totaled  at december  compared to  at december  securities available for sale as of december  were  compared to  as of december  the loan portfolio also provides an additional source of liquidity due to the bank s participation in the secondary mortgage market 
sales of residential mortgages in the secondary market were approximately million in and million in  which allowed the bank to meet the needs of customers for new mortgage financing 
the loan portfolio also provides significant liquidity through repayment of loans by maturity or scheduled amortization payments of million during the next months 
on the liability side  liquidity is available through customer deposit growth and short term borrowings 
federal home loan bank available borrowing capacity as of december  was  with existing capital stock ownership 
federal funds purchased lines are also in place 
management monitors liquidity daily because customer deposit levels fluctuate daily and loan fundings  maturities and investment purchases occur with irregularity 
the amount of liquidity needed is determined by changes in levels of deposits and in the demand for loans 
management believes that these mentioned sources of funds provide sufficient liquidity 
year the following section contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the actual impact on the corporation of the year issue could materially differ from that which is anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors identified below 
the year issue yk is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
it is anticipated that most systems may recognize a date using as the year rather than 
this could result in system failures  miscalculations  and disruptions of normal business operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send statements  or engage in similar day to day business activities 
at sterling financial corporation  we recognize the year problem is more than just a systems issue 
it is a business issue  and we are dealing with it in that manner 
corporation s state of readiness sterling financial corporation is committed to ensuring that the corporation s daily operations suffer little or no impact from the century date change 
the corporation has applied due diligence throughout the yk process  following the guidelines contained in the series of federal financial institutions examination council s interagency guidelines 
these guidelines include the following five phases awareness  assessment  renovation or remediation  testing or validation and implementation 
management has initiated an enterprise wide program to prepare the corporation s computer systems and applications for the year the corporation has developed a comprehensive inventory of all mainframe and pc based applications  third party relationships  environmental bank vaults  vcrs  security systems  etc 
and proprietary programs 
this assessment identified systems or processes and proprietary programs  which could be impacted by the century date change 
the proprietary programs consist of management reporting  interface programs  and bridge programs 
as of december   the corporation has remediated or of these programs 
in january of  the corporation began converting its computer systems to be year ready 
as of december   approximately of the corporation s systems were ready  with all systems expected to be ready by june vendor type total yk ready yk ready pc based applications mainframe applications third party relationships environmental proprietary programs total the corporation has acquired its core mission critical systems from a highly regarded third party vendor 
thus  even though the corporation does not have direct control over the renovation process  it is monitoring the progress of its third party vendors to assess the status of their yk readiness efforts 
however  because most computer systems are  by their very nature  independent  it is possible that noncompliant third party computers could impact the corporation s computer systems 
the corporation could be adversely affected by the yk problem if it or unrelated parties fail to successfully address the problem 
steps have been taken to communicate with the unrelated parties with whom it deals to coordinate year readiness 
additionally  we are dependent on external suppliers  such as  wire transfer systems  telephone systems  electric companies  and other utility companies for continuation of service 
the corporation is also assessing the impact  if any  the century date change may have on its credit risk 
the corporation is contacting its large commercial loan customers concerning their level of readiness for year formal communications have been initiated with all of its vendors and large commercial customers to determine the extent to which the corporation is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
the yk project manager has available each vendors yk readiness efforts which includes their remediation plan  renovation approach  testing methodologies and target dates 
a comprehensive testing plan has been developed 
the corporation has prioritized all mainframe and pc based applications  third party relationships  environmental and proprietary programs to be tested 
separate environments for testing have been defined and established 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the corporation performed a variety of testing to include limited unit testing aging dates forward on files  system testing advancing the computer system date forward and combined system integration running applications dependent on each other together with the data files aged and computer system date advanced forward and acceptance testing user review and validation 
test scripts have been written which define the type of testing to be performed  the resources necessary to perform the test  the transactions or files to be processed  and expected results for each type of testing performed 
additionally  a testing validation  certification and reporting process has been established 
costs of year as of december    has been expended as year costs 
management expects to spend a total of  for the entire project 
the estimated year project costs include the costs and time associated with the impact of third parties year issues  and are based on presently available information 
the total cost of the project is being funded through operating cash flows 
the corporation continues to evaluate appropriate courses of corrective action  including replacement of certain systems whose associated costs would be recorded as assets and amortized 
accordingly  the corporation does not expect the amounts required to be expensed over the next months to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations 
however  if readiness is not achieved in a timely manner by the corporation or any of its significant related third parties  be it a supplier of services or customer  the yk issue could possibly have a material effect on the corporation s operations and financial position 
the cost of the projects and the date on which the corporation plans to complete both year modifications and systems conversions are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
risks of year at present  management believes its progress in remediating the proprietary programs and installing yk upgrades to the third party vendor mainframe and pc based computer applications is on target 
the year computer problem creates risk for the corporation from unforseen problems in its own computer systems and from third party vendors who provide the majority of the corporation s mainframe and pc based computer applications 
failures of third party systems relative to the yk issue could have a material impact on the corporation s ability to conduct business 
continency plans a contingency plan has been developed for mission critical and required mainframe and pc based applications  third party relationships  environmental and proprietary programs 
the corporation s contingency plans involve the use of manual labor and replacement or update of computer systems to compensate for the loss or inconveniences caused by the disruption of certain automated computer systems 
the contingency plans define scheduled completion dates  test dates and trigger dates 
the trigger date being the date the corporation would implement the continency plan 
a detailed business resumption contingency plan is currently under development with a target completion date of march  this detailed business resumption contingency plan will calculate a risk factor for each core business line and or product 
based on the calculated risk factor  a specific business resumption contingency plan will be written and tested 
new financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

this statement amends and extends to all servicing assets and libilities the accounting standards for mortgage servicing rights now in fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities  and supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities based on the consistent application of the financial components approach 
this approach requires the recognition of financial assets and servicing assets that are controlled by the reporting entity  the derecognition of financial assets when control is surrendered and the derecognition of liabilities when they are extinguished 
specific criteria are established for determining when control has been surrendered in the transfer of financial assets 
liabilities incurred and deriviatives obtained by transferors in connection with the transfer of financial assets are measured at fair value  if practicable 
servicing assets and other retained interests in transferred assets are measured by allocating any prior carrying amount between the assets sold  if any  and the interest retained  if any  based on the relative fair values of the assets at the date of transfer 
servicing assets retained are then subject to amortization and assessment for impairment 
as issued  this statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december   and is to be applied prospectively 
the fasb became aware that the volume and variety of certain transactions and the related changes to information systems and accounting processes necessary to comply with the requirements of sfas no

this statement shall be effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  sterling has not yet completed the analysis of the effects of this statement 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk discussion of market risk and interest rate sensitivity as a financial institution  the primary component of the bank s market risk is interest rate volatility 
changes in interest rates will ultimately impact the bank s interest income from earning assets and the interest expense from funding sources  which are deposits and debt 
based upon the bank s nature of operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank s market area for loans and deposits is concentrated in lancaster county  pennsylvania and as such is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the bank does not own any trading assets 
the bank does not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps and caps 
management endeavors to control the exposure of earnings to changes in interest rates 
the bank s asset liability committee manages interest rate risk by various means including gap management and internally developed models and reports 
the bank also utilizes sheshunoff interest rate risk management services and ibaa investment portfolio valuation services to enhance risk exposure review 
interest repricing of assets and liabilities is measured over future time periods interest rate sensitivity gaps 
while all time gaps are measured  management s primary focus is the cumulative gap through year  as this time frame directly impacts net interest income and is most difficult to make reactive adjustment to current market rate movements 
the bank has various investments structured to change investment yield with current market conditions 
assets subject to repricing include federal funds sold which reprice daily  loans floating to treasury bill indexes which reprice monthly and loans tied to prime or other indexes subject to immediate change 
other factors effecting income are maturing and contracted repayments and prepayments of existing loans and investments 
these cash flows will be re invested at current market yields 
the bank s funding liabilities  customer deposits and borrowed funds  have more complex repricing characteristics  since interest bearing deposits are subject to rate change but are not specifically indexed to prime or treasury indexes 
time certificates and borrowed money are subject to interest rate change at maturity 
the bank s deposit funding is essentially comprised of core deposits that have been historically loyal and stable  and these deposits  with the exception of certificates of deposit  have not been rate sensitive to the point of affecting balances 
all interest rates do not move in full and equal amounts for loans and deposits 
deposit rates historically lag loans in rate movement  and rate movement occurs to a smaller degree for deposits than loans 
modeling is used to forecast projected impact to the net interest margin as a result of rate movements  either increasing or decreasing 
historic pricing correlations are calculated for all interest bearing deposit products for rate repricing projections as expected over future time periods based on past history 
as illustrated in table  management s view of interest rate sensitivity reflects a calculated interpretation of net interest margin exposure to rate changes 
rate correlations are constantly refined by management 
there is no guarantee that past history will accurately reflect future changes

this change in earning asset mix from loans to investment securities  compounded by lower rates resulted in a decrease in the yield on earning assets 
funding by deposits increased in time deposits increased and other deposits increased 
the change in mix in deposits resulted in higher total cost which offset lower rates paid on deposits 
future change in net income as a result of interest rate movement is presented in the graph in table a 
this analysis  completed by sheshunoff information services  depicts the projected change to income resulting from interest rate movements 
the bank s risk to interest rate movement illustrates that the future income of the bank will decrease with increasing market rates  and future income will increase with decreasing market rates during the next fiscal year
