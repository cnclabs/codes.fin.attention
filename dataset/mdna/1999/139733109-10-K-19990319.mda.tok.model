the company anticipates that cash from operations and existing and future short term and long term debt will provide adequate liquidity to acquire additional properties  conduct its operations  fund administrative and operating costs and interest payments  and allow distributions to shareholders in accordance with the internal revenue code of  as amended the code requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust and to avoid any corporate level federal income or excise tax for at least the next twelve months 
in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes  the company will be required to make substantial distributions to its shareholders 
the following factors  among others  will influence the decisions of the board of trustees regarding distributions annual base rent under the leases  and returns from short term investments 
although the company will receive most of its rental payments on a monthly basis  it intends to make distributions quarterly

acquisitions will be made subject to the investment objectives and policies of the company to maximize both current income and long term growth in income 
the company s liquidity requirements with respect to future acquisitions may be reduced to the extent the company uses units as consideration for such purchases 
year compliance management of the company has adopted a plan to confront year issues 
under the plan  management is conducting an assessment of the potential material effect of year issues on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition and is determining ways to mitigate the issues 
the year issue exists because many date sensitive computer systems and applications use a two digit number to recognize the year 
when the year arrives  the computer system may recognize the year as or not at all 
information technology and embedded technology that is not year compliant may cause computer systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly  which could lead to disruptions in the company s operations 
the company s year plan has three focal points including the company s internal financial data and operating systems  the company s property tenants financial data and operating systems  and significant third parties with whom the company or the company s tenants have material relationships 
the plan is organized to assess the potential risk of year issues and provide ways to mitigate those risks 
the company s internal financial data and operating systems the company has completed an assessment of both its information technology and the embedded technology of its computer systems and software applications that could materially affect the company s business and believes that they are year compliant 
the company came to this conclusion after receiving assurance of compliance from the manufacturers of the company s network  hardware and material software applications  as well as by running tests using year data on the company s accounting software applications 
although the company believes the computer systems and software applications are year compliant  there can be no assurance that coding errors or other defects will not be discovered in the future 
the company s property tenants financial data and operating systems the company has had discussions with the management of several of the company s tenants regarding their year compliance 
in addition  the company s tenants were sent questionnaires regarding the year compliance of their financial data and operating systems 
the questionnaire specifically addresses areas which the company believes may pose a material risk and requests that each tenant characterize their year readiness 
tenants have been asked to describe the steps they have taken to ensure year readiness and when non ready systems will be in compliance 
the company is currently waiting for the tenants responses and will  upon receipt  assess the risk and the need of a contingency plan 
the company is currently not aware of any tenants who are not year compliant 
material third parties there are significant third parties on which the company s and the tenants operations are dependent 
included in the tenants questionnaires are questions relating to the tenants significant third party dependencies 
in addition  the company has requested and received written confirmation from its significant third parties of their year compliance 
overall  the company believes that it will not incur significant costs in modifying its existing software applications  replacing hardware or hiring consultants in resolving year issues 
although the company has not incurred any material expenditures relating to year issues as of december   there can be no assurance as to the magnitude of future costs until the company s assessment is complete 
failure to correct material year issues may result in the interruption  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations and may adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
management of the company believes that continued progress in implementing the year plan will significantly reduce the company s potential of a year operational interruption 
as of december   management of the company had no knowledge of a year event or uncertainty that is likely to materially affect the company 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined under the revised definition adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring plus depreciation amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry 
depreciation amortization of assets not unique to the industry  such as amortization of deferred financing costs and non real estate assets  is not added back 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
the company considers ffo a meaningful  additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
comparison of the company s presentation of ffo  using the nareit definition  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
ffo of the operating partnership for the year ended december  is computed as follows in thousands net income before minority interest  real estate depreciation and amortization  funds from operations  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are monitored by the company s management as an integral part of the company s overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations will effect the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on the company s fixed rate debt instruments at december  had been one percent higher  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately million 
as of december   the company does not have any variable rate debt instruments  and therefore interest rate fluctuations would not have effected the company s annual interest costs for the year ended december
