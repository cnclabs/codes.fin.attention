comparable restaurant sales are calculated to include a new restaurant only after its first full month following the eighteenth month of its operation 
comparable restaurant revenues may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors 
see factors affecting operating results below 
cost of sales is composed primarily of the cost of food and beverages 
operating expenses include payroll and fringe benefit costs  occupancy costs  marketing costs and other store level costs

occupancy costs include both a fixed and percentage portion of rent

sop requires entities to expense as incurred all start up and preopening costs that may not otherwise be capitalized as long lived assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company elected early adoption of sop in the fourth quarter of the company s adoption of sop resulted in a one time  after tax charge for fiscal in the form of a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  for the unamortized balance of preopening costs as of december  preopening costs in were expensed as incurred 
the new expense as incurred standard may lead to increased variability in the amount of preopening costs recognized  depending on the number and timing of restaurant openings 
as a result  the company s operating results may fluctuate to a greater extent than under the previously applied principle 
general and administrative expenses are composed of expenses associated with all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide an infrastructure to support future growth  including management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems and training and market research

liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  including approximately million in net proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
for the periods presented  the company has funded its capital expansion primarily with cash flow generated from new and existing restaurant operations 
the cash flow from operations increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal at december   the company s working capital totaled million compared to million at december  net cash used in financing activities was  for as compared to cash provided of million in in october  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
repurchases may be made in the open market at prevailing prices or in negotiated off market transactions 
through december   the company had repurchased approximately  shares of common stock in the open market for an aggregate of approximately million 
in addition  the company received  in cash from the issuance of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan and  from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
the cash provided in related primarily to the receipt of million in net proceeds from the initial public offering 
a term loan held by a commercial bank was repaid in full in march the company has a credit agreement  which provides for a million revolving line of credit and which expires on march  at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the credit line 
capital expenditures  net of construction allowances received  were million for as compared to million for in  the company opened two new restaurants  located in seattle and walnut creek  enhanced an existing restaurant and began construction on two of the restaurants to open in the company intends to open a total of four restaurants in the company also anticipates incurring additional expenditures to enhance certain of its existing restaurants 
total capital expenditures in  net of construction allowances  are expected to be approximately million 
the company expects that its planned future restaurants will require  on average  a total investment by the company per restaurant  net of anticipated landlord contributions  of approximately million  with additional average pre opening costs per restaurant of approximately  the company intends to finance these capital expenditures through a combination of cash provided by operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand  and landlord construction contributions when available 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  the size of restaurants developed and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
although no assurance can be given  the company believes that anticipated cash flow from operations  existing cash balances and borrowings under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund its capital requirements  including planned expansion and ongoing maintenance and renovation of existing restaurants  at least through in the event that additional capital is required  the company may seek to raise that capital through public or private equity or debt financings 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s year preparations began in fiscal the preparations include identification and assessment of all software  hardware  equipment and non information technology it systems that could be affected by the year issue and remedial action  where necessary  followed by further testing 
analysis to identify internal year deficiencies has been completed 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company has identified one main software system  its bakery group software system  that will require replacement 
this system had already been identified as a system that was to be replaced in the ordinary course of business 
the company expects to replace the current bakery group software with a system that is year compliant 
to date  the company has identified and assessed the replacement software and plans to have the new software tested and in operation by mid the company currently estimates that the costs of that software will be approximately  furthermore  based on its assessment to date  the company believes that future costs associated with its year compliance effort will not be material 
however  because both it and non it systems may contain embedded technology  this may complicate the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
the company intends to fund year compliance costs through cash provided by operations 
the company also intends to contact critical suppliers of products and services to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to such suppliers failures to resolve their own year compliance issues 
the company has obtained verbal assurances and is in the process of obtaining written verification of year compliance from the third parties that have provided licensed software for such systems as accounting and point of sale and payroll services 
as part of its year readiness efforts  the company intends to develop contingency plans to identify activities which will need to be performed in the event of system failures 
the contingency plans are expected to be completed by july  based on its assessment to date  the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business operations 
if year issues are not properly identified  or if assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely with respect to year problems that are identified  the year problem could materially adversely impact the company s results of operations and adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year problems of other entities will not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems or results of operations 
factors affecting operating results and quarterly results this management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements may be deemed to include the timing of and plans for anticipated restaurant openings  the projected investment and costs required for future restaurants  the adequacy of anticipated sources of cash to fund the company s future capital requirements through  and the costs of the company s year compliance efforts and dates by which the company believes it will complete such efforts 
words such as believes  anticipates  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements  but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements 
readers are cautioned that the forward looking statements reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements 
actual events or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed herein  as well as other risks set forth under the caption risk factors in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the company s business is subject to a number of challenges and risks including  among other things  the risks associated with the company s pursuit of a more aggressive growth strategy  risks related to the company s relatively small operations base and the geographic concentration of the company s restaurants  uncertainties associated with possible changes in food and labor costs  potentially adverse weather conditions  and the impact of potential governmental regulation  risks related to the company s dependence on its key personnel  uncertainties related to the intensely competitive nature of the restaurant business  as well as potential liabilities associated with long term leases 
the company s plans for new restaurant locations and timing of openings depend upon  among other things  timely project development and restaurant construction  obtaining appropriate regulatory approvals  management of costs and recruitment of qualified operating personnel 
the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  competitive factors  weather conditions  the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  net sales contributed by new restaurants  the company s ability to execute its business strategy  fluctuations in inventory and general and administrative expenses  and increases or decreases in comparable restaurant revenues 
due to the foregoing factors  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and  from time to time in the future  the company s results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
comparable restaurant sales may also vary from period to period as a result of similar factors 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations are food and labor costs 
during  there was significant volatility in the cost of certain bakery related commodities  principally butter and manufacturing cream 
many of the company s restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect the company s labor costs 
in addition  increases in the minimum wage have resulted in indirect pressure on other wage levels 
to date  inflation except for the impact of minimum wage increases has not had a material impact on the company s operations 
the minimum wage increased under federal legislation to an hour in september and increased in california to an hour in march in january  the minimum wage increased to an hour in oregon and to an hour in washington 
additional increases to the minimum wage have been proposed 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in april  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants approved statement of position sop entitled reporting on the costs of start up activities 
the sop requires entities to expense as incurred all start up and preopening costs that may not otherwise be capitalized as long lived assets 
the sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company elected early adoption of sop in the fourth quarter of the company s adoption of sop resulted in a one time  after tax charge for fiscal in the form of a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  for the unamortized balance of preopening costs as of december  preopening costs in were expensed as incurred 
the new expense as incurred standard may lead to increased variability in the amount of preopening costs recognized  depending on the number and timing of restaurant openings 
as a result  the company s operating results may fluctuate to a greater extent than under the previously applied principle 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s cash and cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk 
the company invests primarily on a short term basis 
the financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
the fair values of these instruments were determined by net present values 
in our sensitivity analysis  the same change in interest rate was used for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if interest rates increased by  the expected effect on net income related to the company s financial instruments would be immaterial
