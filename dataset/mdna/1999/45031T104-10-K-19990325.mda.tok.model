company background 
itc deltacom was incorporated in march as a wholly owned subsidiary of itc holding to acquire and operate itc holding s retail services and carriers carrier services businesses 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  this reorganization has been accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
itc deltacom has provided operator and directory assistance services since march through interquest 
carriers carrier services have been offered since late through interstate fibernet  a partnership originally formed by itc holding with a interest and scana with a interest 
in august  itc holding acquired scana s interest in interstate fibernet 
also in august  itc holding formed a second partnership with scana  gulf states fibernet  to construct and operate a fiber optic route primarily from atlanta  georgia to shreveport  louisiana with several supplemental spur routes 
in the gulf states acquisition  itc holding acquired scana s partnership interest in gulf states fibernet and the georgia fiber assets  which included one customer contract representing million in annual revenues through august  the term of the contract 
members of itc deltacom s management have been managing the businesses of both interstate fibernet and gulf states fibernet since their inception 
in january  as a result of the deltacom acquisition  itc deltacom entered the retail long distance business and acquired several fiber optic routes within alabama that complemented the existing networks operated by interstate fibernet and gulf states fibernet 
deltacom  a provider of telecommunications services since its inception in  provides long distance services to mid sized and major regional businesses in the southern united states 
carriers carrier 
itc deltacom provides carriers carrier services using its owned and managed fiber optic network 
this network reaches over pops in the following ten southern states 
alabama 
arkansas 
florida 
georgia 
louisiana 
mississippi 
north carolina 
south carolina 
tennessee 
texas of the network s approximately  route miles  approximately  are company owned and operated and approximately  are owned and operated principally by three public utilities duke power company  florida power light company and entergy technology company with which itc deltacom has marketing and management arrangements 
itc deltacom s arrangement with entergy is exclusive 
in addition  itc deltacom has a buy sell agreement with carolinas fibernet  llc  which manages fiber optic facilities in north carolina and south carolina 
this agreement enables the parties to buy and sell capacity on each other s networks and allows itc deltacom to provide customers with access to pops throughout those states 
in addition  as part of its strategy  itc deltacom intends to continue to evaluate the potential expansion of its network through a combination of new construction  long term dark fiber leases and fiber swap transactions  depending on the extent of capital required over the economic life of the fiber assets to be deployed 
to the extent that itc deltacom elects to expand its network through long term leases in lieu of construction or fiber swap transactions  itc deltacom expects such leases to have a negative effect on ebitda  as adjusted  however  itc deltacom expects any such expansion of its network would provide opportunities to generate additional revenues  which would partly offset such negative effects 
itc deltacom expects to add approximately owned and operated route miles to its fiber network by the end of through a combination of construction and long term dark fiber leases on various routes 
itc deltacom derives commission revenues from the marketing  sale and management of capacity on the utility owned portions of itc deltacom s network 
negligible incremental costs are associated with these commissions  because itc deltacom uses the same marketing and sales force in servicing the utility owned portions of the network as it does for the portions owned by itc deltacom 
itc deltacom s commission revenues from these arrangements amounted to approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
itc deltacom expects commissions associated with the utility owned portions of the network to continue to increase in itc deltacom provides wholesale long haul services to its carrier customers on a take or pay long term basis  on an individual circuit basis  or on a month to month basis after the initial term of the take or pay or individual circuit contract 
as of december   itc deltacom had remaining future long term contract commitments totaling approximately million 
these contracts expire on various dates through and are expected to generate approximately million in revenues to itc deltacom through during  itc deltacom accelerated its deployment of dense wave division multiplexing dwdm optronics on high density routes 
itc deltacom plans to continue this strategy during as it strives to increase the efficiency of its network 
at december   of itc deltacom s network was protected by self healing rings which is a network design that enables traffic to be rerouted to an alternate fiber optic cable 
itc deltacom expects to increase the number of routes that are ring protected during to approximately  as it believes that diverse path routing with automatic switching during catastrophic failure events are key differentiators in the marketplace 
retail services 
retail services involve the provision of voice  data or video telecommunications services to end users or resellers 
retail services include local services 
itc deltacom currently provides local service by using its own facilities and by reselling the services of incumbent local exchange carriers 
over time  itc deltacom expects to migrate a majority of the local service onto its own facilities 
at december   itc deltacom offered local exchange services in of the markets in which it provided retail services 
local service revenue comprised approximately of all new retail services revenues purchased by customers during in connection with offering local exchange services  itc deltacom has entered into an interconnection agreement with bellsouth to resell bellsouth s local exchange services and interconnect itc deltacom s network with bellsouth s network for the purpose of gaining immediate access to all of bellsouth s unbundled network elements 
this agreement allows itc deltacom to enter new markets with minimal capital expenditures and to offer local exchange service to its current customer base 
the bellsouth interconnection agreement currently allows itc deltacom to provide local service on a resale basis or by purchasing all unbundled network elements required to provide local service on a facilities basis  without using company owned facilities 
the terms of this interconnection agreement  including interim pricing terms agreed to by itc deltacom and bellsouth  have been approved by state regulatory authorities in all states in which bellsouth operates  although they remain subject to review and modification by such authorities 
in addition  the bellsouth interconnection agreement does not resolve all operational issues  which issues itc deltacom and bellsouth are continuing to negotiate to resolve 
itc deltacom believes that this interconnection agreement provides a foundation for it to provide local service on a reasonable commercial basis  but there can be no assurance in this regard and important issues remain unsettled as a result of legal and regulatory developments and related matters 
the bellsouth interconnection agreement expires july  itc deltacom and bellsouth are negotiating to renew the terms of this agreement 
in the event the parties fail to agree on such renewal terms by july   the agreement provides that the parties will continue to exchange traffic under the current agreement until such time as renewal terms  conditions and prices are ordered by a state commission or negotiated by the parties with such terms  conditions and prices becoming effective retroactive to july  there can be no assurance  however  that itc deltacom will be able to renew the bellsouth interconnection agreement under favorable terms  or at all 
itc deltacom has also entered into similar interconnection agreements with gte corp 
for its alabama market and with sprint corporation for sprint s florida markets and itc deltacom intends to complete interconnection agreements with gte corp  sbc communications  inc and sprint corporation for certain other markets that it serves or intends to serve 
itc deltacom s strategy is ultimately to offer facilities based local service in a majority of its markets by collocating its equipment with that of bellsouth and other incumbent local exchange carriers with which it has concluded interconnection agreements 
itc deltacom began collocating its equipment in certain bellsouth central office locations during the first quarter of as of december   itc deltacom had completed physical collocation of switching equipment in bellsouth markets  and was offering its unity product in markets 
the unity product  which itc deltacom markets primarily to mid sized and major regional businesses  utilizes a direct t connection from the customer s location to a company switch and provides the customer with both local and long distance calling on any of available channels 
itc deltacom expects to add an additional collocations during bringing its total collocations to pursuant to the bellsouth interconnection agreement  itc deltacom began billing bellsouth for reciprocal interconnection charges related to the provision by itc deltacom of facilities based local exchange services during a significant amount of such charges are attributable to call terminations by itc deltacom to customers that are isps 
bellsouth has stated that it views termination to such isps as not included under the reciprocal charge arrangements set forth in the interconnection agreement  and has refused to pay compensation for such terminations either to itc deltacom or to other clecs operating under similar interconnection agreements 
the alabama puc  in response to a request from itc deltacom  scheduled a hearing for september   at which the issue reviewed was the failure by bellsouth to pay the disputed charges 
the alabama puc rendered a ruling in favor of the clecs on this issue and  on march   issued an order requiring bellsouth to pay all withheld reciprocal compensation sums within days 
bellsouth is expected to appeal this order 
itc deltacom is reviewing all potential remedies and claims in remaining jurisdictions 
this same issue is a matter of dispute between incumbent local exchange carriers and clecs across the country 
in view of bellsouth s stated position that such charges with respect to isps are excluded from the reciprocal charge arrangements set forth in the interconnection agreement  and the fact that the ultimate outcome of this controversy before the state regulatory authorities and in the courts is uncertain  itc deltacom does not record any revenue for these charges until received and reserves directly against the amounts billed to bellsouth 
for the year ended december   such charges to bellsouth amounted to approximately million 
as of december   itc deltacom had recognized revenue of an amount equal to approximately of the total cumulative local interconnection billings 
the payment reflects bellsouth s estimate of the local minutes terminated to itc deltacom exclusive of any minutes related to traffic terminated to an isp 
accordingly  itc deltacom recognized approximately  in operating revenues during and continued to reserve against the remaining million of cumulative local interconnection billings 
itc deltacom believes its position with respect to the remaining million of billings is supported by the terms of the bellsouth interconnection agreement  as do other clecs who are strongly contesting refusals by incumbent local exchange carriers to pay compensation in these circumstances 
many regulatory authorities that have addressed the issue have ruled in favor of clecs  but the issue generally remains under appeal in those circumstances 
in florida  georgia  north carolina and tennessee  the state utility commissions have ruled in favor of the clecs 
the issue in these states is under appeal by the ilecs 
the issue is still pending in kentucky  louisiana and south carolina 
mississippi has issued an unfavorable ruling against clecs on this issue 
although the provision of facilities based local services involves high fixed costs  associated variable costs are generally low 
consequently  a resolution of the controversy with respect to payment of such charges by bellsouth in favor of itc deltacom could have a positive impact on both gross margin and ebitda  as adjusted 
assuming current levels of such local minutes continue or increase  itc deltacom expects such charges to bellsouth to be at least million through the first two quarters of the bellsouth interconnection agreement expires  however  on july  although discussions have taken place between the parties  there can be no assurance that the interconnection agreement will be renewed on the same terms with respect to the disputed charges  or at all 
therefore  even if the controversy regarding such charges is resolved in favor of itc deltacom under the current interconnection agreement  there can be no assurance that any positive effect on itc deltacom s financial position will continue beyond july  itc deltacom expects that as it increases its provision of local service on a facilities basis rather than on a resale basis  it will reduce its own access costs when it sells its end users long distance  and realize increased revenues from the originating and terminating switched access services it provides to other carriers originating and or terminating calls for itc deltacom s local end user customers 
certain incumbent local exchange companies  including bellsouth  have taken the position that when a carrier seeking to provide local service obtains all necessary elements loops and switches from the incumbent local exchange carrier in a combined form  the incumbent local exchange carrier retains the right to receive the access revenues associated with service to the customers served on that basis 
further legal challenges are likely and important issues related to this form of interconnection remain open including issues related to when a competitor can obtain network elements used for  among other things  access purposes 
itc deltacom anticipates that an increasing portion of its revenue will be derived from local services  primarily those provided pursuant to the bellsouth interconnection agreement and similar agreements with other local exchange carriers 
management expects that gross margin associated with facilities based local retail services will be slightly better than gross margin associated with long distance retail services  but that  in general  gross margin associated with retail services will be lower than that associated with carriers carrier services 
there can be no assurance that itc deltacom will be able to enter into additional interconnection agreements on terms acceptable to itc deltacom or at all  or that the incumbent local exchange carriers will provide the operational support required for itc deltacom to provide local services to end users 
long distance 
itc deltacom offers a full range of retail long distance services  including traditional switched and dedicated long distance  calling  international  calling card and operator services 
data services 
itc deltacom provides high quality data services to its customers primarily using frame relay switches distributed throughout itc deltacom s network  which enables customers to use a single network connection to communicate with multiple sites throughout itc deltacom s fiber optic network 
itc deltacom currently provides atm services on a facilities based and resale basis 
itc deltacom will continue to seek  through strategic business relationships with other providers  to interconnect its fiber optic network with the fiber optic networks of other companies 
itc deltacom anticipates increased demand for data services in the future  and expects that in the future a larger percentage of its revenues will be derived from the sale of dedicated data services 
internet access  intranet services and web development 
itc deltacom provides dedicated  frame relay internet access and internet and intranet services  electronic mail  e commerce  web page design and web hosting services 
itc deltacom expects that mid sized and larger businesses will require faster internet access and larger bandwidth in the future  and intends to develop and offer products and services that will respond to that demand using itc deltacom s network and enhanced technology 
during itc deltacom increased its focus on providing services to the internet marketplace by expanding its existing service offering to the isp market segment 
itc deltacom offers local service to isps via primary rate interface connectivity  including the collocation of the isps terminal equipment such as modems  routers and or network servers 
itc deltacom increased its capital expenditures related to this service significantly during the second half of and expects to continue to allocate an increasing amount of capital to these services during in addition  itc deltacom has begun supporting and reselling icat electronic commerce suite  which enables users to create  manage and deliver sophisticated e commerce with secure transaction processing across the internet 
with itc deltacom s ability to bundle its web design and hosting services with the icat product  itc deltacom has positioned itself to offer internet solutions to major regional accounts 
during  itc deltacom became an internet corporate partner and began providing high speed fiber optic connectivity and data switching services to various universities 
internet  organized as the university corporation of advanced internet development  represents a consortium of over universities nationwide that desire to connect their research and computing centers together over a network at speeds many times greater than that available through the existing internet 
itc deltacom provides high speed fiber optic connectivity and data switching services that help to expand this nationwide facility throughout the southeastern united states 
itc deltacom currently provides connectivity to universities in alabama  florida and georgia 
during  itc deltacom intends to pursue additional opportunities with other universities in its state region 
customer premise equipment sale  installation and repair 
itc deltacom sells  installs and repairs customer premise equipment such as telephones  office switchboard systems and  to a lesser extent  pbx for customers in the following markets 
anniston  birmingham  dothan  florence  huntsville  mobile and montgomery  alabama 
atlanta and columbus  georgia 
pensacola  florida 
baton rouge  lousiana 
charlotte  north carolina 
columbia and greenville  south carolina itc deltacom intends to offer customer premise equipment sales  installation and repair in additional markets in the future  with the goals of enhancing and supporting itc deltacom s sale of local and long distance services and enhancing customer retention 
itc deltacom plans to form relationships with local customer premise equipment installation companies in all of its markets for the purpose of selling and installing customer premise equipment not otherwise provided by itc deltacom 
although itc deltacom expects that a majority of its revenue growth will come from its retail services business  itc deltacom does not expect its retail services to obtain a significant share of the market for telecommunications services in the southern united states 
the customer contracts for retail services generally provide for payment in arrears based on minutes of use for switched services and payment in advance for private line services 
the contracts generally also provide that the customer may terminate the affected services without penalty in the event of certain outages in service  and for certain other defined causes 
the contracts also typically provide that the customer must use at least a minimum dollar amount of switched long distance services per month for the term of the contract 
during the past several years  market prices for many telecommunications services segments have been declining  which itc deltacom believes will likely continue 
in response to these and other competitive pressures  itc deltacom has modified certain of its retail contracts to extend to certain customers lower rates over longer terms as a means of maintaining and developing itc deltacom s customer base 
in the future  in response to competitive considerations  itc deltacom may decide to modify certain other retail customer contracts in a similar manner  emphasizing lower pricing and longer commitment periods 
a substantial portion of itc deltacom s total revenues is from retail long distance services 
revenue per minute from such services has been declining and is expected to continue to decline 
operating expenses 
itc deltacom s principal operating expenses consist of cost of services  selling  operations and administration expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services 
cost of services related to retail services consists primarily of access charges and local facility charges paid to local exchange carriers  as well as wholesale carrier origination  termination and interexchange facility charges paid to other interexchange carriers 
cost of services related to carriers carrier services are substantially all fixed costs attributable to 
the leasing of dark fiber under long term operating leases  
the leasing of capacity outside itc deltacom s owned or managed network off net capacity to meet customer requirements 
network costs associated with the provision of ss services 
itc deltacom purchases off net capacity to provide carriers carrier services in cases where itc deltacom plans to construct its own network to replace the off net portion of certain fiber routes 
itc deltacom also purchases off net capacity in connection with an existing customer contract  pursuant to which itc deltacom is the exclusive provider of network capacity to such customer 
although itc deltacom is substantially able to meet the requirements of such customer on itc deltacom s network  itc deltacom purchases off net capacity to fill such customer s requirements that cannot be met on itc deltacom s network 
selling  operations and administration 
selling  operations and administration expenses consist of expenses of selling and marketing  field personnel engaged in direct network maintenance and monitoring  customer service and corporate administration 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization include depreciation of itc deltacom s telecommunications network and equipment and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions  primarily the deltacom acquisition 
as itc deltacom continues to expand into new geographic markets  add new branch offices and facilities and enlarge its current product offerings  cost of services and selling  operations and administration expenses are expected to increase substantially 
therefore  itc deltacom expects to incur increasing operating losses over the next few years 
although itc deltacom anticipates that it will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations  it expects that such cash flows will be more than offset by capital expenditures during the next several years as it implements its business plan 
in addition  itc deltacom expects to experience a negative impact on ebitda  as adjusted  through as a result of its plan to continue accelerate the roll out of its retail services business 
itc deltacom expects that its gross margins from its bundle of telecommunications services will continue to be adversely affected by its local service product  because the gross margin on the resale of local services through incumbent local exchange carrier facilities will be lower than the gross margin on itc deltacom s existing businesses 
as itc deltacom increasingly uses incumbent local exchange carrier unbundled network elements instead of resold services  itc deltacom expects gross margin on local service to improve 
such improvement is expected to result from reduced access charges and from efficiencies realized through increased reliance on itc deltacom s owned network 
competitive market pressures to reduce prices for retail services  as discussed above  however  could offset improved margins that may result from shifting away from resold local exchange services 
there can be no assurance that growth in itc deltacom s revenues or customer base will continue or that itc deltacom will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive net cash flows 
in addition  itc deltacom may from time to time engage in discussions involving potential acquisitions  joint venture or strategic alliances 
depending upon the circumstances  itc deltacom may not disclose material acquisitions until completion of a definitive agreement 
any significant transaction  shortfalls in anticipated revenue  or increases in expenses could have a material adverse effect on itc deltacom s liquidity and capital resources and on its ability to meet its strategic objectives  and could require itc deltacom to seek additional private or public equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that itc deltacom will be able to raise any required capital on terms acceptable to itc deltacom  or at all

the maturation of existing sales offices 
continued product expansion as local exchange services and data services increased as a percentage of total retail services revenue 
an increase in the customer base from approximately  to approximately 
increase in long distance minutes of use 
continued stability from period to period in the rate of revenue loss from lost customers 
itc deltacom expects to see its percentage of revenues derived from local exchange services and data services to continue to increase as a percentage of total retail services revenue during as these services are sold to new and existing customers 
additionally  itc deltacom expects to see increased revenues in all of its products as each of its sales offices matures and itc deltacom opens new sales offices to penetrate new markets 
itc deltacom completed one acquisition during  it group communications  a jackson  mississippi based long distance carrier  but the majority of itc deltacom s revenue growth during was a result of itc deltacom s execution of its business plan through internal expansion efforts 
revenues from carriers carrier services increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue for the carriers carrier segment was primarily attributable to continued 
increases in the existing customer base as a result of increasing demand for bandwidth 
expansion of owned and operated routes 
growth in commissions derived from the managed  monitored  and marketed routes 
itc deltacom expects revenues from its carriers carrier segment to continue to increase as demand for bandwidth increases 
although new competitors are expected to enter the market creating pricing pressure on primary route segments  itc deltacom believes this pressure will be mitigated by the increasing demand for bandwidth 
no single carriers carrier or retail services customer represented over of itc deltacom s total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  cost of services total cost of services increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  cost of services for retail services operations increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the cost of services as a percentage of revenue for retail services operations increased from in to in the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for retail services was primarily attributable to

cost of services for the carriers carrier operations increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the cost of services as a percentage of revenue for carriers carrier operations increased from in to in the increase in the cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the carriers carrier services was primarily attributable to 
acceptance of fibers under a long term dark fiber operating lease for a route from dallas to longview  texas in april 
pricing pressures encountered as new competitors entered the market 
itc deltacom expects the increase in cost of services related to the dallas to longview  texas lease will be offset during by traffic brought on net during itc deltacom believes the pricing pressures will be offset in the future by an increasing demand for bandwidth allowing for continued revenue growth 
selling  operations and administration expense total selling  operations and administration expense increased million  from million as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  to million as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  selling  operations and administration expense attributable to retail services increased million  from million as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  to million as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  the increase in selling  operations and administration expense as a percentage of revenue for the retail services segment was related to 
increase in the number of employees  primarily sales  information system and provisioning personnel 
continued geographic expansion including opening seven new branch offices 
expansion of existing service offerings  primarily local services 
external costs associated with itc deltacom s year readiness program  which amounted to approximately million for the year ended december  none in 
selling  operations and administration expense attributable to the carriers carrier segment increased million  from million as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  to million as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  the increase in selling  operations  and administration expense for the carrier s carrier segment resulted from the increased cost of personnel necessitated by geographic and service capability expansion of the network 
selling  operations  and administration expenses are expected to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue early in  due to the continued expansion of the retail services segment  both geographically and in terms of products offered 
itc deltacom expects that by mid  selling  operations and administration expenses will improve as a percentage of revenue as a majority of its planned market expansion will be completed 
depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  retail services accounted for million of the increase  which was primarily related to installation of new telecommunications equipment 
carriers carrier services accounted for million of the increase which was primarily attributable to network expansion 
itc deltacom expects depreciation and amortization to continue to increase during as itc deltacom adds new switches and other facilities to its network and expands into new markets 
interest expense total interest expense increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense in was due to interest expense incurred on the march notes  the november notes and five additional months interest on the notes 
itc deltacom expects interest expense to increase during as a result of incurring interest for a full year on the outstanding notes 
interest income interest income increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of short term investment of proceeds from itc deltacom s senior notes 
itc deltacom expects the amount of interest income to decrease during as itc deltacom uses the proceeds from its notes offerings to expand the network 
other expense in march  itc deltacom changed the accounting for its interest rate swap agreement from a hedge of an anticipated transaction to a trading security resulting in a non cash charge against earnings of approximately million 
this change in classification required itc deltacom to record the interest rate swap agreement on the consolidated balance sheet at fair market value at the time of receipt of the proceeds from the march notes offering 
the interest rate swap agreement is marked to market on a monthly basis 
for the year ended december   itc deltacom recognized approximately million expense from the mark to market of the interest rate swap

carriers carrier services accounted for  of the increase 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in of this million increase  million was attributable to deltacom  including million of intangible amortization on million of intangibles pushed down to itc deltacom 
carriers carrier services accounted for  of the increase as a result of additional capital expenditures made for the provision of ss services  capital expenditures associated with itc deltacom s network management systems required to support the various management and marketing agreements with various utilities  and small electronic overbuilds on existing network segments 
other income expense other expense increased from  in to million in itc deltacom s share of gulf states fibernet s partnership losses accounted for million of this increase  which was partially offset by a  increase in other interest and miscellaneous income 
gulf states fibernet began full operations in late and  accordingly  the effect of a full year of operations was not reflected until gulf states fibernet recorded a pretax loss of million in  compared to a pretax loss of  in as of december  and  itc deltacom owned of gulf states fibernet and recorded losses of  and million  respectively  from such interest 
interest expense interest expense increased from  in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in itc deltacom s aggregate indebtedness resulting from the million of deltacom indebtedness 
itc deltacom incurred interest expense of million related to such indebtedness in ebitda  as adjusted ebitda  as adjusted  increased from million in to million in deltacom accounted for million and carriers carrier services accounted for million of the increase 
the increased ebitda  as adjusted  attributable to carriers carrier services is a result of an increase in revenues with minimal increases in associated variable costs 
liquidity and capital resources itc deltacom has historically generated positive cash flow from operations from its existing lines of business  but has required equity infusions and advances from itc holding to finance a significant portion of its investing and financing activities

cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

for  cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the deltacom indebtedness  which was advanced to itc deltacom by itc holding 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the sale of the notes and million from the initial public offering  less million of repayment of advances from itc holding  net repayments of other long term debt and capital leases of million and million of other cash used in financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the sale of november notes  million from the sale of the march notes and million from exercise of common stock options less million of repayment of notes  million premium paid on early retirement of notes  net repayment of other long term debt and capital leases of million 
itc holding partially financed the deltacom acquisition and the gulf states acquisition with debt  which consists of the following 
a million term loan under a bank facility incurred in connection with the deltacom acquisition and pushed down to itc deltacom the deltacom indebtedness  
a million bridge facility incurred in connection with the gulf states acquisition  which required the refinancing of gulf states fibernet s existing project facility  and 
a million unsecured note issued in connection with the gulf states acquisition and assumed by a subsidiary of itc deltacom 
in november  this note was repaid in full approximately million with a portion of the net proceeds from the initial public offering 
on july   in connection with the reorganization  approximately million of the million of net proceeds from the sale of the notes was used to purchase us government securities  held by the notes trustee in a pledged account to fund the first six scheduled interest payments on the notes 
the balance of the net proceeds from the notes offering  approximately million  was released to itc deltacom 
a portion of the released proceeds was applied on july  as follows to repay approximately million of indebtedness to itc holding including approximately million of accrued interest associated with the deltacom acquisition and advances used by itc deltacom for capital expenditures  and to repay approximately million of indebtedness incurred under the bridge facility together with approximately  of accrued interest 
in connection with the reorganization  million of the deltacom indebtedness was forgiven by itc holding and contributed to itc deltacom as additional equity 
in september  interstate fibernet  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of itc deltacom  entered into a credit agreement with nationsbank of texas  na for a five year million term and revolving credit facility to be used for working capital and other corporate purposes  including refinancing existing indebtedness  capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions 
in february  itc deltacom amended the credit facility to provide  among other things  for a million revolving credit facility 
see item businessdescription of significant indebtedness 
itc deltacom recorded a loss of approximately million in connection with the reclassification of itc deltacom s interest rate swap agreement converting a hedge of an anticipated transaction to a trading security as a result of the march notes offering described below 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this interest rate swap agreement 
the credit facility contains restrictions on interstate fibernet  inc and its subsidiaries and requires interstate fibernet  inc 
to comply with certain financial tests and to maintain certain financial ratios 
the credit facility is guaranteed by itc deltacom and deltacom and is secured by a first priority lien on all current and future assets of interstate fibernet  inc and its subsidiaries and a first priority pledge of the stock of interstate fibernet  inc and its subsidiaries 
on october   itc deltacom completed the initial public offering in which it issued  shares of common stock  par value 
per share  at a price of per share 
after giving effect to the two for one stock split itc deltacom completed in the third quarter of  the initial public offering would have been  shares at a per share price of 
on march   itc deltacom issued million principal amount of its march notes  at a price of  yielding net proceeds of approximately million 
itc deltacom is using the proceeds to replace portions of the proceeds from itc deltacom s initial public offering in october  which itc deltacom used in april to redeem million of its notes at a redemption price of  to fund continued market and fiber optic expansion and to replace funds that would have otherwise been available under itc deltacom s credit facility  which was modified to  among other things  reduce available borrowings thereunder from million to million 
on april   itc deltacom redeemed million principal amount of the notes  with proceeds remaining from the initial public offering  at a redemption price of of such principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
itc deltacom recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately million related to the early redemption of this debt 
in connection with the redemption  the trustee for the notes released to itc deltacom approximately million held by the trustee as security for the payment of remaining interest through june  on the notes being redeemed 
see item business description of significant indebtedness notes 
on may   itc deltacom completed its acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of it group communications  a jackson  mississippi based long distance carrier 
itc deltacom issued  shares of common stock and assumed liabilities of approximately million to consummate the transaction 
itc deltacom acquired approximately customers  predominately located in mississippi and an important network point of presence in jackson  mississippi 
on november   itc deltacom issued  in a private offering  million principal amount of its november notes  yielding net proceeds of approximately million 
itc deltacom intends to use the net proceeds from the private offering to fund market expansion  the on going development and construction of itc deltacom s fiber optic network  product development and general corporate purposes 
concurrently with the issuance of the november notes  itc deltacom amended its secured revolving credit facility with nationsbank  na  to permit the issuance of and payments on the november notes  and to maintain the lenders commitment under the credit facility at million 
at december   itc deltacom had entered into agreements with vendors to purchase approximately million of equipment and services  and  for the year ended december   had made capital expenditures of million 
itc deltacom currently estimates that its aggregate capital requirements will total approximately million in inclusive of the million in commitments as of december  
itc deltacom expects to make substantial capital expenditures thereafter 
capital expenditures in will be primarily for the following 
continued addition of facilities based local telephone service to its bundle of integrated telecommunications services  including acquisition and installation of switches and related equipment 
continued addition of switching capacity  electrical equipment and additional collocation space in connection with the expansion of itc deltacom s isp local telecommunications services 
market expansion 
continued development and construction of its fiber optic network including transmission equipment 
infrastructure enhancements  principally for information systems 
the actual amount and timing of itc deltacom s capital requirements may differ materially from the foregoing estimate as a result of regulatory  technological and competitive developments including market developments and new opportunities  or in the event itc deltacom decides to make acquisitions or enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances in itc deltacom s industry 
see item business risk factors we may not have  or be able to obtain  the significant amounts of capital that we need to expand our network  operations and services as planned 
itc deltacom may require additional capital to fund its growth  as well as to fund continued operating losses and working capital 
itc deltacom believes that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility subject to compliance with applicable covenants  will provide sufficient funds to enable itc deltacom to expand its business as currently planned through the second quarter of  after which itc deltacom may need to seek additional financing to fund capital expenditures and working capital 
if the credit facility or other sources of funds are unavailable  itc deltacom may not have a ready source of liquidity 
in the event that itc deltacom s plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  the foregoing sources of funds may prove to be insufficient to fund itc deltacom s currently planned growth and operations 
in addition  if itc deltacom makes acquisitions  itc deltacom may be required to seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
additional sources may include equity and debt financing and other financing agreements  such as vendor financing 
there can be no assurance that itc deltacom will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that additional financing arrangements will be available  or if available  that they can be concluded on terms acceptable to itc deltacom 
inability to generate or obtain sufficient funds would result in delay or abandonment of some or all of itc deltacom s development and expansion plans  which could have a material adverse effect on itc deltacom 
although itc deltacom s liquidity has improved  itc deltacom s level of indebtedness and debt service obligations significantly increased as a result of itc deltacom s issuance of the notes  the march notes and the november notes 
the successful implementation of itc deltacom s strategy  including expansion of its network and obtaining and retaining a significant number of customers  and significant and sustained growth in itc deltacom s cash flow are necessary for itc deltacom to be able to meet its debt service requirements 
there can be no assurance that itc deltacom will successfully implement its strategy or that itc deltacom will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to improve its earnings before fixed charges  or to meet its debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
the ability of itc deltacom to meet its obligations will be dependent upon the future performance of itc deltacom  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
year the year issue 
the year issue is the result of a computer programming practice first utilized during the s when storage space was very expensive and processing capability was limited 
by shortening the year portion of date field entries to two digits rather than four  programmers could save valuable storage space and increase data processing speeds 
this method of date entry became the standard method for programmers for mainframes  personal computers  and hardware  including processor chips 
because of this programming convention  software  hardware  or firmware may recognize a date field using as the year rather than the year if left uncorrected  this could possibly result in system failures  miscalculations  or errors causing disruptions in software dependent operations 
itc deltacom s program 
itc deltacom has undertaken a comprehensive program to address the year issue with respect to the following 
itc deltacom s information technology and operating systems including network switching  customer service  call detail and billing systems 
itc deltacom s non information technology systems such as buildings  plant  equipment and other infrastructure systems that may contain embedded microcontroller technology 
the systems of its major vendors  third party network service providers  and other material service providers insofar as they relate to itc deltacom s business 
itc deltacom s major carrier s carrier and retail services customers 
as explained below  the program involves 
a wide ranging assessment of the year problems that may affect itc deltacom 
the development of remedies to address the problems discovered in the assessment phase 
testing of the remedies 
the preparation of contingency plans to deal with failure scenarios 
these steps will vary to meet the particular needs of a system or company division and  in some cases  will overlap 
assessment  for example  is an on going element of itc deltacom s year program 
assessment phase 
as part of the assessment phase of this program  itc deltacom has identified substantially all of the major components of the systems described above 
in order to determine the extent to which such systems are vulnerable to the year issue  itc deltacom 
evaluated its internally developed software applications 
inventoried and assessed the facilities and equipment utilized by itc deltacom 
contacted substantially all of its significant hardware  software  and other equipment vendors  third party network service providers  other material service providers  and material customers  requesting detailed  written information related to their year compliance and the compliance status of the products or services they provide to itc deltacom  if any 
in addition  itc deltacom performs a year readiness assessment of all potential purchases  leases  or contracts in an effort to prevent the acquisition of a non compliant system or facility 
to date  itc deltacom has received and analyzed responses from substantially all of its major vendors and service providers 
itc deltacom has also received responses from approximately one fifth of its customers to which inquiries were sent 
the responses received included itc deltacom s major carrier s carrier and retail services customers 
based upon the responses received to date  and assuming contradictory responses are not received in the future from the third parties who have been solicited  itc deltacom believes that its third party computer operating systems dedicated to itc deltacom s customer service  call detail records and billing systems and its nortel and ascend system switches are now year compliant 
itc deltacom is in the process of investigating  and intends to closely monitor  the year readiness of the three public utilities that own and operate approximately  miles of itc deltacom s approximately  mile fiber optic network 
two of these utilities have indicated that they intend to be year compliant by year end and one has stated that its goal is to be compliant by mid itc deltacom has been informed by the financial institutions that provide services to itc deltacom that they each have undertaken year programs and expect to be year compliant 
itc deltacom s two largest carrier s carrier customers  which together represented approximately of itc deltacom s consolidated revenues for the fiscal year  have responded that they are on target to have mission critical systems year compliant by the end of the first quarter of in one instance  and by the end of the second quarter of in the other instance 
of itc deltacom s five largest retail services customers  which represented an aggregate of approximately of itc deltacom s consolidated revenues for the fiscal year  four have either informed itc deltacom or made public disclosures that their mission critical systems are now year compliant 
remediation and testing 
based upon the results of itc deltacom s assessment efforts  itc deltacom conducted remediation and testing of the at risk systems identified by the assessment 
the activities conducted during this phase were intended to affirmatively address potential year problems in itc deltacom developed computer software in its information technology and non information technology systems  and then demonstrate that the remediation was effective when the system is used within normal operating parameters 
in this phase  itc deltacom first evaluated a program application and  if a potential year problem was identified  steps were taken to remediate the problem  and the application is then individually tested to confirm that the remediating changes were effective and did not adversely affect the functionality of that application 
similar remediation and testing was undertaken with respect to the hardware and other equipment that operates or is operated by the software 
after the individual applications and system components were remediated and tested  integrated testing was conducted to demonstrate functional integrated systems operation 
itc deltacom has now completed the remediation and testing of its internally developed code and the systems that operate and are operated by such software  and itc deltacom has placed the remediated systems and software into production 
as itc deltacom completes this remediation  it has arranged to conduct laboratory simulated integrated systems testing in an effort to demonstrate year compliance of itc deltacom s integrated telecommunications systems as they interface with external systems and the equipment of major vendors  third party network providers  other material service providers and customers 
this testing effort covers itc deltacom s essential network configurations and integration configurations with the most common network components which are utilized by customers and other third parties who interconnect with itc deltacom s network 
contingency plans 
itc deltacom is working on identifying and developing contingency plans to handle its most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios 
itc deltacom intends to complete its determination of the reasonably likely worst case scenarios after the information received from third party inquiries are compiled and the results of the network integration testing become available to itc deltacom 
itc deltacom anticipates that the bulk of its contingency planning will primarily address potential year problems due to failures to remediate major systems successfully  and the potential failure of itc deltacom s interconnecting carriers and vendors year remediation efforts 
itc deltacom expects to complete its contingency plans by the end of the third quarter of these contingency plans will continue to be refined and updated through the end of based upon  among other things  responses from third party inquiries 
a failure to meet this target could materially impact itc deltacom s operations 
program execution and oversight 
itc deltacom has established a year project office  and itc deltacom s executive management reviews itc deltacom s progress on year efforts on a monthly basis 
the board of directors has designated the year oversight role to the board s audit committee  and that committee receives periodic updates and progress reports on itc deltacom s year preparations 
to execute its year program  itc deltacom is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct  reprogram  and test its systems for year compliance 
itc deltacom s use of internal resources to achieve the aims of its year program has not had a material adverse effect on its ability to develop new products and services or to maintain and upgrade  if necessary  its existing products and services 
itc deltacom s use of external resources to achieve the aims of its year program has not had a material adverse effect on itc deltacom s operations or earnings 
costs related to the year issue 
itc deltacom has incurred  and expects to incur in the future  internal labor as well as consulting and other expenses necessary to prepare its systems for the year through the end of  itc deltacom incurred approximately million in external costs for its year program 
itc deltacom currently estimates that it will incur additional external expenses during to complete its year compliance work  which are not expected to exceed approximately million 
these costs  which may vary from the estimates  have been  and will continue to be  expensed as incurred 
risks related to the year issue 
itc deltacom is implementing a detailed process to minimize the possibility of service interruptions or adverse effects related to the year issue 
although itc deltacom s year efforts are intended to minimize the potential adverse effects of the year issue on itc deltacom s business and operations  the actual effects of the issue cannot and will not be known until the year failure by itc deltacom and or its major vendors  third party network service providers  and other material service providers and customers to adequately address their respective year issues in a timely manner insofar as they relate to itc deltacom s business could have a material adverse effect on itc deltacom s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
like all telecommunication service providers  itc deltacom s ability to provide service is dependent on its interconnecting carriers and third party vendors  including non telecommunications related services providers 
if these third parties fail to achieve year compliance on a timely basis  itc deltacom could be adversely impacted by their failure 
there is a potential for some revenue erosion caused by reduced telecommunications service demand by both carrier s carrier customers and retail services customers because of their year failures 
itc deltacom has taken steps to raise customer awareness of the year issue and to encourage its customers to develop and implement plans to become year compliant 
itc deltacom s failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption or a failure of itc deltacom s normal business activities and operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect itc deltacom s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
at this time  itc deltacom is unable to determine whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on itc deltacom s results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition due to the general uncertainty inherent with the year problem  caused in part from the uncertainty of the interconnecting carriers and vendors year readiness  as well as uncertainties related to itc deltacom s ongoing remediation program 
itc deltacom s year program is expected to reduce significantly itc deltacom s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of itc deltacom s major vendors  third party network service providers  and other material service providers and customers 
itc deltacom believes that  with the internal implementation of remediated information and network systems  its interconnecting carriers and primary vendors year readiness  and completion of the year compliance plan as scheduled  it will maintain normal operations for all dates after december  effects of new accounting standards sfas no
