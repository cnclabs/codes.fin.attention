item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to net income for was million  a increase compared to million for this improvement was a result of significant growth in premiums earned  net investment income and other income  partially offset by a higher provision for losses  policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
new primary insurance written during was billion  a increase compared to billion for the increase in cmac s primary new insurance written was primarily due to a increase in primary new insurance written volume in the private mortgage insurance industry for as compared to in addition  cmac completed a bulk transaction in the second quarter of  insuring approximately million of seasoned california loans with a risk profile similar to the company s regular business 
cmac s market share of the industry volume increased to in  compared to for additionally  in  cmac wrote an increased amount of pool insurance which represented risk written of million as compared to million in most of this pool insurance volume relates to a group of structured transactions composed primarily of fannie mae and freddie mac eligible conforming mortgage loans that are geographically well dispersed throughout the united states and have lower average loan to value ratios than cmac s primary business 
the performance of this business to date has been better than anticipated although the business is relatively young and the historical performance might not be an indication of future performance 
under a pool insurance transaction  the exposure to cmac on each individual loan is uncapped  however  the aggregate stop loss percentage typically to of the aggregate original loan balance in the fannie mae freddie mac transactions is the maximum that can be paid out in losses before the insurer s exposure terminates 
the company expects its pool insurance activity to decline during as certain outstanding commitments expire and are not renewed 
premium rates on such pool insurance are significantly lower than on primary insurance loans due to the low stop loss levels  which limit the overall risk exposure to cmac  and the focus of such product on high quality primary insurance customers 
both s p and moody s have determined that the capital requirements to support such pool insurance will be significantly more stringent than on primary insurance due to the low premium rates 
cmac s volume in was positively impacted by low interest rates which affected the entire mortgage industry 
the trend toward lower interest rates  which began in the third quarter of  caused refinancing activity during to continue at a higher rate than normal and strong housing prices have caused a large percentage of the refinanced loans to be closed without private mortgage insurance at an ltv of or below 
therefore  the rate of growth in the private mortgage industry has not been as high as that of the entire mortgage market 
cmac s refinancing activity as a percentage of primary new insurance written was for as compared to in however  for the fourth quarter of  refinanced loans represented of new primary insurance written as compared to only for the third quarter of as a result of the slight decline in interest rates during the fourth quarter 
the persistency rate  which is defined as the percentage of policies in force that are renewed in any given year  was for as compared to for this large decline was consistent with the increase in the level of refinancing activity during the persistency rate for the beginning of should continue at a level similar to although if the current refinance boom slows  the persistency rate could improve 
cmac also has recently become involved in insuring non conforming loans  specifically alternative a and a minus loans 
alternative a borrowers have an equal or better credit profile than cmac s typical insured borrowers  but these loans are underwritten with reduced documentation and verification of information 
cmac typically charges a higher premium rate for this business due to the reduced documentation  but does not consider this business to be significantly more risky than its normal primary business 
the a minus loan programs typically have non traditional credit standards which are less stringent than standard credit guidelines 
to compensate for this additional risk  cmac receives a significantly higher premium for insuring this product that is commensurate with the additional default risk 
during  alternative a and a minus business accounted for of cmac s new primary insurance written 
net premiums earned in were million  an increase compared to million for this increase reflected the insurance in force growth resulting from strong new insurance volume and the increase in pool insurance written during  and was partially offset by the decline in persistency levels 
the strong volume led to an increase in direct primary insurance in force during of  from billion at december  to billion at december  direct pool risk in force also grew to million at december  from million at the end of  an increase of for the year 
cmac and the industry have entered into risk sharing arrangements with various customers that are designed to allow the customer to participate in the risks and rewards of the mortgage insurance business 
one such product is captive reinsurance  in which a mortgage lender sets up a mortgage reinsurance company that assumes part of the risk associated with that lender s insured book of business 
in most cases  the risk assumed by the reinsurance company is an excess layer of aggregate losses that would be penetrated only in a situation of adverse loss development 
for  premiums ceded under captive reinsurance arrangements were million or less than of total premiums earned during and new primary insurance written under captive reinsurance arrangements was billion  or of total new primary insurance written 
cmac expects to enter into several new agreements in  although the aggregate amount of captive reinsurance is not expected to have a material financial impact on cmac s balance sheet or financial results in net investment income for was million  a increase compared to million in this increase was a result of continued growth in invested assets primarily due to positive operating cash flows of million during the company has continued to invest new operating cash flow in tax advantaged securities  primarily municipal bonds  although the company did modify its investment policy to allow the purchase of various other asset classes  including common stock and convertible securities  beginning in the second quarter of the company s intent is to target the common equity exposure at a maximum of of the investment portfolio s market value while the convertible securities and mortgage backed securities exposures are targeted not to exceed each 
during  the company purchased a total of million of common equities which led to a slight decrease in the growth in investment income during although there will be a short term decline in investment income from this change in investment policy  the company expects no material long term impact on total investment returns as a result of this investment diversification 
the provision for losses was million in  an increase of compared to million in this increase reflected the significant growth and maturation of cmac s book of business over the past several years  which has caused an increase in the number of defaults reported to cmac  the continued adverse experience of california loans despite signs of an improving trend in california  and the continued poor experience of certain affordable housing program loans insured in and  especially in florida 
although the ultimate performance of the books of business that originated since cannot yet be determined  it appears that the ultimate loss levels will be slightly higher than average  partially due to the presence of these affordable housing loans 
claim activity is not evenly spread throughout the coverage period of a book of business 
relatively few claims are received during the first two years following issuance of the policy 
historically  claim activity has reached its highest level in the third through fifth years after the year of loan origination 
approximately of cmac s primary risk in force and almost all of cmac s pool risk in force at december  had not yet reached its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
cmac s overall default rate at december  was as compared to at december   while the default rate on the primary business was at december  as compared to at december  the number of defaults rose from  at december  to  at december  and the average loss reserve per default rose from  at the end of to  at december  this increase in average loss reserve per default reflected the company s continued implementation of a more conservative reserve calculation for certain loans in default perceived as having a higher risk of claim incidence 
in addition  an increase in the average loan balance and the coverage percentage on loans originated beginning in has necessitated a higher reserve balance on loans in a default status due to the increased ultimate exposure on these loans 
the default rate in california was including pool at december  as compared to at december  and claims paid in california during were million  representing approximately of total claims as compared to in california represented of primary risk in force at december  as compared to at december  the default rate in florida was including pool at december  as compared to at december  and claims paid in florida during were million  representing approximately of total claims as compared to only in florida represented of primary risk in force at december  as compared to at december  the affordable housing early default experience is a result of insuring certain loans in which the borrowers principal and interest reserves and other credit factors were not as strong as on prior years books of business 
certain underwriting changes were implemented near the end of to compensate for the factors that contributed to the early default experience on these affordable housing loans  however  it is too early to determine the impact of such changes 
in addition  the company has reported an increased number of defaults on the alternative a and a minus business insured beginning in although the default rate for this business is higher than on cmac s normal books  it is not currently higher than was expected for this type of business and the higher premium rates charged are expected to compensate for the increased level of risk 
direct losses paid in were million as compared to direct losses paid during of million  an increase of only 
underwriting and other operating expenses were million for  an increase of compared to million for these expenses consisted of policy acquisition expenses  which relate directly to the acquisition of new business  and other operating expenses  which primarily represent contract underwriting expenses  overhead and administrative costs 
policy acquisition costs were million in  an increase of compared to million in this increase reflects the growth in variable sales and underwriting related expenses relating to the company s continued growth in new insurance written 
the company has continued development of its marketing infrastructure needed to support a focus on larger  national mortgage lenders in order to take advantage of the widespread consolidation occurring in the mortgage lending industry 
other operating expenses for were million  an increase of compared to million for most of the increase continued to result from an increase in expenses associated with the company s ancillary services  specifically contract underwriting 
contract underwriting expenses for included in other operating expenses were million as compared to million for  an increase of 
the million increase in contract underwriting expenses during represented of the million increase in other operating expenses 
some of these additional contract underwriting expenses were correspondingly offset by increases to other income  which rose from million in to million in during  loans underwritten via contract underwriting accounted for of applications  of insurance commitments  and of certificates issued by cmac as compared to of applications  of commitments and of certificates in in  these percentages are expected to increase if there is a decrease in refinancing activity 
changing market conditions have caused the cost of contract underwriting to increase during and due to the high demand for available resources 
however  as further efficiencies are realized in the contract underwriting process due to the integration with freddie mac s loan prospector and fannie mae s desktop underwriter origination systems  the cost per contract underwriting loan underwritten could decrease 
the effective tax rate for was as compared to for operating income accounted for of net income in as compared to in thus resulting in the increase in effective tax rate for compared to net income for was million  a increase compared to million for this improvement was a result of significant growth in premiums earned and net investment income  partially offset by a higher provision for losses  policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
new primary insurance written during was billion  an increase compared to billion for this increase reflected a market share increase which was primarily due to cmac s continued focus on large  national primary insurance customers and continued geographic expansion into markets previously underrepresented by cmac such as the northwest and midwest 
the increase resulted despite a decline in new insurance written volume in the private mortgage insurance industry in cmac s market share of the industry increased to in  compared to for and for the fourth quarter of  cmac s market share was 
additionally  in  cmac wrote an increased amount of pool insurance which represented an addition to risk of million as compared to million in most of this pool insurance volume related to a group of structured transactions composed primarily of fannie mae and freddie mac eligible conforming mortgage loans that are geographically dispersed throughout the united states and that have lower average loan to value ratios than cmac s primary business 
under a pool insurance transaction  the exposure to cmac on each individual loan is uncapped  however  the aggregate stop loss percentage typically to in the fannie mae freddie mac transactions is the most that can be paid out in losses before the insurer s exposure terminates 
the company expects its pool insurance activity to continue at this same level in due its demand in the marketplace 
premium rates on such pool insurance are significantly lower than on primary insurance loans due to the low stop loss levels  which limit the overall risk exposure to cmac  and the focus of such product on high quality primary insurance customers 
nonetheless  this pool insurance has contributed to the increase in earned premiums during standard poor s has recently determined that the capital requirements to support such pool insurance will be significantly more stringent than on primary insurance due to the low premium rates and cmac has reviewed its capital levels to ensure compliance with these requirements 
the average stop loss on pool insurance written during was refinanced loans represented of new primary insurance written during as compared to in however  for the fourth quarter of  refinanced loans represented of new primary insurance written as compared to only for the fourth quarter of as lower interest rates in the third quarter of caused refinance activity to increase significantly in the fourth quarter 
the persistency rate was for as compared to for this increase was consistent with the slight decline in the level of refinancing activity during the majority of cmac s business in reflected the deeper insurance coverage required by fannie mae and freddie mac beginning in that coverage  which is on loans written with an ltv between and and on loans with ltvs greater than  results in higher premiums and losses than the older coverages of and  respectively  but should not materially affect the company s financial results 
approximately of cmac s direct primary insurance in force had such deeper coverage at the end of monthly premium plans  which allow borrowers to pay premiums on a monthly basis rather than annually in advance  accounted for of cmac s primary new insurance written in as compared to in although this program reapportions the cash flow from an insured loan over the life of the loan  there should be no material financial effect from its widespread use 
at the end of  the industry and cmac introduced a variation of the monthly premium plan in which the borrower does not need to pay any mortgage insurance premium at closing and under which some portion of the first month s premium can be deferred or forgiven 
during  business written under this program was approximately of cmac s total as compared to in net premiums earned in were million  a increase compared to million for this increase reflected a continuation of high persistency levels  the insurance in force growth resulting from strong new insurance volume  increased premium rates on deeper coverages and higher ltv insured products during and the increase in pool insurance written during the strong volume and high persistency led to an increase in direct primary insurance in force during of  from billion at december  to billion at december  direct pool risk in force also grew to million at december  from million at the end of  an increase of for the year 
primary new insurance written on loans with ltvs greater than represented of the total amount written in as compared to in net investment income for was million  a increase compared to million in this increase was a result of continued growth in invested assets primarily due to positive operating cash flows of million  offset slightly by a small decrease in investment yields 
the company s pre tax investment yield declined from at december  to at december  the company has continued to invest new operating cash flow in tax advantaged securities  primarily municipal bonds 
the provision for losses was million in  an increase of compared to million in this increase reflected the significant growth and maturation of cmac s book of business over the past several years  the continued adverse experience of california loans  and the relatively poor experience of certain affordable housing program loans insured starting in although the ultimate performance of the books of business that originated since cannot yet be determined  it appears that the ultimate loss levels will be higher than average  due in part to the presence of these affordable housing loans 
cmac s overall default rate at december  was as compared to at december  the number of defaults rose from  at december  to  at december  and the average loss reserve per default rose from  at the end of to  at december  this increase in average loss reserve per default reflected the company s continued implementation of a more conservative reserve calculation for certain loans in default perceived as having a higher risk of claim incidence 
in addition  an increase in the coverage percentage on loans originated beginning in has necessitated a higher reserve balance on loans in a default status due to the increased ultimate exposure on these loans 
the default rate in california was including pool at december  as compared to at december  and claims paid in california during were million  representing approximately of total claims as compared to in the affordable housing early default experience is a result of insuring certain loans in which the borrowers principal and interest reserves and other credit factors were not as strong as on prior years books of business 
certain underwriting changes were implemented near the end of to compensate for the factors that contributed to the early default experience on these affordable housing loans  however  it is too early to determine the impact of such changes 
the company believes that many loan servicers have changed the timing of reporting loans in default  which has continued to result in an incremental increase in the number of loans in default 
this change allows for earlier intervention with borrowers in default  which might lead to a higher cure rate for such loans 
underwriting and other operating expenses were million for  an increase of compared to million for these expenses consisted of policy acquisition expenses  which relate directly to the acquisition of new business  and other operating expenses  which primarily represent overhead and administrative costs 
policy acquisition costs were million in  an increase of compared to million in this reflects the increase in sales and underwriting related expenses relating to the company s continued market share expansion and the development of the company s marketing infrastructure needed to support a focus on larger  national mortgage lenders in order to take advantage of the widespread consolidation occurring in the mortgage lending industry 
other operating expenses for were million  an increase of compared to million for much of the increase continued to result from an expansion of the company s technology efforts and an increase in expenses associated with the company s ancillary services  specifically contract underwriting 
some of these additional contract underwriting expenses were correspondingly offset by increases to other income  which rose from million in to million in  although the main purpose of the contract underwriting effort is to support the sales effort by generating incremental mortgage insurance business 
during  loans underwritten via contract underwriting accounted for of applications  of insurance commitments  and of certificates issued by cmac as compared to of applications  of commitments and of certificates in changing market conditions caused the cost of contract underwriting to increase during due to the shortage of available resources 
the effective tax rate for was as compared to for operating income was of pretax income in as compared to in  thus resulting in the increase in effective tax rate for liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of funds consist primarily of premiums and investment income 
funds are applied primarily to the payment of cmac s claims and operating expenses 
the company generated positive cash flows from operating activities in  and of million  million and million 
the significant increases in operating cash flows reflect the growth in premiums written and insurance in force that has more than offset any increases in claims paid and other expenses 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and other expenses  cash flow shortfalls  if any  are funded primarily through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities 
total investments were million at december   including million of short term investments with maturities of days or less and million of us treasury equivalents and government agency securities 
at december   approximately of the company s investments consisted of money market and investment grade  readily marketable  fixed income securities  concentrated in maturities of greater than five years 
in addition  at december   the company s investment portfolio included million of equity securities  which includes convertible debt and convertible preferred stock 
loss reserves increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase in loss reserves due to newly reported defaults  new loans in default that were not reported  and increases to loss reserves on existing defaults was a result of continued adverse california and florida experience as well as the continued growth of the in force insurance book 
in addition  an increase in the average loan balance and the coverage percentage on loans originated beginning in has necessitated a higher reserve balance on loans in a default status due to the increased ultimate exposure on these loans 
cmac has experienced abnormally high early defaults on the and origination year books of business  which reflected the increase in affordable housing program loans insured in the period 
cmac also experienced an increase in defaults under the alternative a and a minus programs insured starting in late which is a typical pattern for such business 
unearned premiums increased slightly from million at december  to million at december  due to unearned premium resulting from the bulk loan transaction insured in and from certain pool insurance transactions 
stockholders equity plus redeemable preferred stock increased to million at december   an increase of from million at december  this increase resulted primarily from net income for of million  a million increase net of tax in the market value of securities available for sale and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  offset by million of dividends 
as protection against a period of adverse loss development  the company has entered into a variable quota share reinsurance treaty for the primary books of business originated in   and as well as some portion of the pool book of business originated in as per the terms of the reinsurance treaties  the company receives variable quota share loss relief at levels ranging from to based upon the loss ratio on the covered book of business 
a ceding commission is paid by the reinsurer to the company except for certain circumstances where the loss ratio on the covered book exceeds a stated level 
these treaties remain in force for a period of ten years and are noncancelable by either party until after ten years have elapsed except under certain circumstances 
premiums are payable to the reinsurer on a quarterly basis net of ceding commissions due to the company and any losses calculated under the variable quota share coverage are recovered on a quarterly basis 
at the end of the fourth  seventh and tenth years of each treaty  depending on the extent of losses recovered to date on the calendar year quota share portion of the treaty  a calculation is made to determine an amount of underwriting year excess coverage  if any  due to the company 
as part of its year remediation effort  the company will upgrade all desktop and laptop personal computers and vendor software programs that are not currently year compliant see year issue below during the cost of this upgrade is currently estimated at  in addition  the company plans to implement system and network monitoring software during at a cost of approximately  that will enhance the efficiency of the company s operating systems 
the company believes that cmac will have sufficient funds to satisfy its claims payments and operating expenses and to pay dividends to the company for at least the next months 
the company also believes that it will be able to satisfy its long term more than months liquidity needs with cash flow from cmac 
as a holding company  the company conducts its principal operations through cmac 
the company s ability to pay dividends on the preferred stock is dependent upon cmac s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to the company 
based on the company s current intention to pay quarterly common stock dividends of approximately per share  the company will require distributions from cmac of million annually to pay the dividends on the outstanding shares of preferred stock and common stock 
there are regulatory and contractual limitations on the payment of dividends or other distributions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not believe that these restrictions will prevent the payment by cmac or the company of these anticipated dividends or distributions in the foreseeable future 
year issue many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company has conducted an analysis of its systems and has completed its year project with the result that all of its systems were year compliant by the end of year compliant means fault free performance in the processing of data and date related data including  but not limited to  calculating  comparing and sequencing by all hardware and software products  individually and in combination 
fault free performance must include the manipulation of data when dates are in the th or st century and must be transparent to the user 
the company has completed the necessary program modifications to make them year compliant and all date sensitive files have been appropriately modified and updated 
the company has built a stand alone testing environment that allowed simulation of different year end scenarios and testing of the year programming changes and file modifications was completed in october in addition  the company has undertaken a review of all of its hardware systems to assess year compliance 
the company s servers are currently year compliant and any desktop or laptop systems not currently year compliant are scheduled for replacement in although the company will be year compliant  in the event that third parties with whom the company transacts business are not year compliant  potential for an adverse effect on the company s operations may remain 
the company has taken precautions to minimize this risk by contacting each of its mission critical business partners to ascertain their year compliance status
