ffo funds from operations the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit in march which defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
in addition  ffo as computed by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled figures reported by other reits 
the company believes that ffo is an effective measure of the company s operating performance because analysts and investors usually use ffo in analyzing the operating results of real estate companies rather than using earnings per share 
the following is a summary of the company s ffo and a reconciliation of net income to ffo for the periods presented for the years ended december  in thousands funds from operations    increase in funds from operations from prior period reconciliation net income    gain on sale of investments  depreciation and amortization deferred financing leases    consolidated properties    unconsolidated real estate partnerships    minority interest portion   funds from operations    ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization the company believes that there are several important factors that contribute to the ability of the company to increase rent and improve profitability of its shopping centers  including aggregate retailer sales volume  sales per square foot  occupancy levels and retailer costs 
each of these factors has a significant effect on ebitda 
the company believes that ebitda is an effective measure of operating performance because ebitda is unaffected by the debt and equity structure of the property owner 
ebitda i does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s overall performance  iii is not indicative of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities determined in accordance with gaap  and iv is not an alternative to cash flows determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity 
the company s ebitda after minority interest plus its pro rata share of ebitda of unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased from million in to million in the growth in ebitda reflects the addition of total gla  increased rental rates  increased retailer sales  improved occupancy levels and effective control of operating costs

as of december   the company s balance of cash and cash equivalents was million  not including its proportionate share of cash held by unconsolidated real estate partnerships

in december  the company issued million of series c  c and d preferred stock 
scpg purchased million of the series c  and c preferred stock and wat purchased million of the series d preferred stock

the series d preferred stock acquired by wat is not convertible into the company s common stock until approval is obtained from the company s shareholders which the company will seek to obtain at its next annual meeting 
in december  the company issued a collateralized non recourse note payable totaling million 
the proceeds were used to finance a portion of the property portfolio purchased from trizechahn and to refinance an existing collateralized non recourse note and a portion of the unsecured revolving credit facility 
the note is due in december and interest is provided at libor plus 
the company has fixed the rate on this note at through interest rate swap contracts 
during the year ended december   the company obtained secured and unsecured loan facilities totaling  in connection with the purchase of the acquisition centers 
these secured and unsecured loan facilities are due at various dates in and bear interest at either libor or libor during the year ended december   the company assumed mortgage debt totaling approximately million on a pro rata basis in connection with its acquisition of interests in cerritos  utc  valley fair  independence mall  solano  topanga  downtown plaza  north county fair and santa anita

in april  the company exercised the whl warrants 
as a result of the exercise  whl elected to pay the profit element of the whl warrants by issuing  whl ordinary shares 
these shares were then sold by the company for million 
the company s consolidated indebtedness at december  was  million  of which  million is fixed rate debt and million is variable rate debt after considering interest rate protection agreements totaling billion 
the interest rate on the fixed rate debt ranges from to 
the company s pro rata share of debt to total market capitalization  based on the share price at december  was  excluding the capital notes from the numerator 
the maturity dates of consolidated indebtedness range from to scheduled principal amortization and balloon payments in connection with maturing consolidated indebtedness over the next five years and thereafter are set forth in the table below year amount in thousands thereafter  the company believes that redevelopment  repositioning and expansion are key to maximizing the use and performance of its assets and increasing its income growth and capital appreciation 
the company continually evaluates the redevelopment potential of its properties including properties which have undergone redevelopment in the past five years 
due to the financial and regulatory burdens presented by the development of new regional shopping centers  the company believes that an on going redevelopment program provides a cost efficient means of ensuring that the company s existing centers compete effectively within their existing markets and are able to attract new customers 
capital expenditures and capitalized leasing costs totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table shows the components of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing costs 
for the years ended december in millions renovations and expansions tenant allowances capitalized leasing costs other capital expenditures total capital expenditures were financed by external funding and recovery of costs from retailers where applicable 
the company is currently involved in several development projects and had outstanding commitments with contractors totaling approximately million as of december   which will be funded through existing mortgage debt  new mortgage debt and the unsecured revolving credit facility 
the historical sources of capital used to fund the company s operating expenses  interest expense  recurring capital expenditures and non recurring capital expenditures such as major building renovations and expansions have been i funds from operations  ii the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and iii the issuance of equity 
the company anticipates that development projects  expansion projects and potential acquisitions will be funded by external financing sources 
the company anticipates that its funds from operations will provide the necessary funds on a short term and long term basis for its operating expenses  interest expense on outstanding indebtedness and all distributions to the shareholders in accordance with reit requirements 
sources of recurring and non recurring capital expenditures on a short term and long term basis  such as major building renovations and expansions  as well as for scheduled principal payments  including balloon payments on outstanding indebtedness are expected to be obtained from i additional debt financing  ii additional equity and iii working capital reserves 
although no assurance can be given  the company believes that it will have access to capital resources sufficient to satisfy the company s cash requirements and expand and develop its business in accordance with its strategy for growth 
distributions a distribution was declared on december  to shareholders of record on december  of million or per common share for the quarter ended december   which is equal to per common share on an annualized basis 
the company intends to pay regular quarterly distributions to holders of its common stock 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of the properties 
nonetheless  substantially all of the retailers leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation on the company 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on retailer s gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  contractual rent steps  which increase rental rates during the term of the lease  or both 
in addition  the remaining terms of the existing leases are for an average period of less than ten years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher effective rentals if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
substantially all of the leases  other than those for anchors  require the retailers to pay a proportionate share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
inflation may however  have a negative effect on some of the company s other operating items 
interest and general and administrative expense may be adversely affected by inflation as these costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
the company enters into interest rate swap contracts as a means of reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
also  for leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect because the rent increases specified in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time 
year readiness the year problem is the result of computer hardware and software systems collectively referred to as systems and individually as a system having been designed to use a two digit code rather than a four digit code to define the applicable year  as in to represent 
any of the company s systems may misinterpret a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in errors causing such systems to become unreliable or to fail 
on behalf of the company  the company s manager began a company wide assessment in the project to identify the company s reliance on systems using a two digit date code as well as the company s exposure to third party customers and suppliers critical to the company s operations 
the project includes an assessment of the company s dependence upon such systems and third parties as well as establishing priorities for addressing any systems or third party customers and suppliers which are assessed as potential year compliance risks 
the company s initial assessment identified four areas of concern i internal systems which the company uses for information processing  data storage and communication  ii fire  life and safety systems installed at the company s properties which are used for measurement and control of mechanical devices essential to the properties use and operations  iii economic dependence upon significant customers which are critical to the company s operations  and iv relationships with third party suppliers upon which the company s business is substantially dependent 
internal systems in  the manager completed a comprehensive assessment of all communication  hardware and software systems believed to be critical to the company s operations 
as a result of that assessment  the manager began a program of replacing and upgrading all systems which were identified as not being year compliant 
requirements for replacing all hardware and software systems included receipt of written confirmation that the new systems were year compliant 
the conversion was substantially completed on october  the manager is now in the final stage of the conversion which consists of testing the computer system for year compliance 
based upon the assessments and testing to date  no contingency plans are expected to be needed 
management considers its efforts to ensure year compliance of its internal systems to be adequate  however  assurances obtained from hardware and software vendors have not been independently verified and there can be no assurance that testing yet to be performed will be adequate  in all instances  to ensure that all software and hardware systems are compatible and able to function reliably in the year and thereafter 
the cost of the computer conversion as well as the costs to test the system s year compliance will be incurred by the manager and are not reimbursable by the company 
fire  life and safety systems management s initial assessment of the fire  life and safety systems and the heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac systems at its properties indicates that manual overrides on most systems are available as an alternative to existing automated controls for monitoring and controlling existing systems 
the manager has completed an assessment of all electronic and mechanical control systems at its properties and is currently in the process of upgrading or replacing any systems which are not year compliant prior to september  any cost incurred to replace or upgrade such systems are a cost of maintaining the centers and are therefore considered to be recoverable from the tenants under the terms of existing leases 
although there can be no assurance  management considers the financial impact and risk of significant loss because of system changes or business interruptions caused by fire  life and safety systems and hvac systems which are not year compliant to be small 
significant customers the company is also reliant on its customers to make the necessary preparations for the year so that their business operations will not be interrupted  thus threatening their ability to honor their financial commitments 
as of december   all retailers and anchors had been notified of their responsibilities under their leases and reas notwithstanding interruptions to their business resulting from year problems 
the manager is communicating with each of the retailers about their plans and progress in addressing their respective year problems 
an initial risk assessment is expected to be substantially completed by march  although the manager s inquiries indicate that most of these companies are working on becoming year compliant  there can be no assurance that failure to make necessary modifications would not have a material adverse affect on the company 
the cost of communicating with the company s tenants will be incurred by the manager and is not reimbursable by the company 
third party suppliers exposure to third party suppliers is considered to pose a significant risk 
information requests have been distributed to key third party suppliers and replies are being evaluated 
where the risk assessment indicates significant exposure  follow up questionnaires and direct contact in the form of teleconferences and site visits will be performed to assess accuracy of information received and to determine and minimize  to the extent possible  potential loss exposure 
this assessment is anticipated to be completed by the end of the second quarter of although management believes that its efforts with respect to such risks are appropriate  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate to determine the readiness of any of its key third party suppliers in sufficient time to prevent a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s contingency planning for non compliant third party suppliers is to identify by the third quarter of  to the extent possible  alternative suppliers who are year compliant as a replacement source for goods or services 
the cost of communicating with the company s third party suppliers will be incurred by the manager and is not reimbursable by the company 
worst case scenario the worse case scenario could be an extended loss of utility service resulting from interruptions at the point of power generation or line transmission or local distribution to the company s properties 
such an interruption could result in an inability to provide tenants with access to their spaces thereby affecting the company s ability to collect rent and pay its obligations which could result in a material adverse effect on the company 
the effect could be as insignificant as a minor interruption in services provided to tenants at the centers resulting from unanticipated problems encountered by the company s systems or any of the significant third parties with whom the company does business 
the pervasiveness of the year issue makes it likely that previously unidentified issues will require remediation during the normal course of business 
in such a case  the company anticipates that automated procedures could be replaced by manual procedures while systems are repaired and that such interruptions would have a minor effect on the company s operations

net interest differentials to be paid or received related to these contracts are accrued as incurred or earned 
any gain or loss from terminating current swap contracts is recognized in the period the swap contract is terminated or reversed

interest rate exchange agreements are contractual agreements between the company and third parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments periodically without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts notional amounts 
the agreements consist of swaps and involve the future receipt  of a floating rate based on libor and the payment of a fixed rate 
since december   the company has lengthened the average remaining term of its pro rata share of fixed rate borrowings and hedges  including delayed start swaps from years to years 
in the unlikely event that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of an interest rate swap contract  the company s exposure is limited to the interest rate differential between the contract rate and the market rate on the notional amount 
the company does not anticipate non performance by any of the counterparties
