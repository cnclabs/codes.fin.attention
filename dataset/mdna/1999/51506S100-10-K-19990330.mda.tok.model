year compliance the company has conducted an evaluation of its computer systems and products in an effort to determine the actions  if any  necessary to make them year compliant 
the term year compliant or similar terms generally means that information technology hardware and software are able to correctly interpret and manipulate dates up to and through the year  without interruption as the result of the change to this date 
this evaluation has involved both testing its computer systems and requesting certifications from its vendors 
the company has received vendor certification that all of its business critical information technology systems  including internal communication systems  accounting and finance systems  customer service systems and sales and marketing tracking systems  are year compliant 
based upon its evaluation  the company has determined that approximately eighty percent of its information technology systems are year compliant  but has also found that certain non business critical software applications may not be compliant 
the company is engaged in upgrading  replacing and testing these applications  and this process is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company also recognizes that there are risks with respect to embedded systems that are not necessarily a part of the company s information technology systems but contain microprocessor chips  which may not function properly with the change of date to the year the majority of the embedded systems on which the company relies in its day to day operations are owned and managed by the lessors of the buildings in which the company s offices are located  or by agents of such lessors 
during the second quarter of  the company will move its headquarters to a new facility  presently under construction and containing new mechanical systems  in reston  virginia 
additionally  the company intends to install a new telephone switch in the new facility 
the company is in the process of determining whether such new mechanical and telephone switch systems are year compliant  and presently believes that they will be so  based on its building construction manager s experience with other such systems  and the claims made by the manufacturers of such systems 
the company intends to seek certificates from these manufacturers that their systems are year compliant 
because the company believes that its information technology and embedded systems will be substantially year compliant in advance of the year date change  the company currently has no contingency plan to address non compliance 
the company expects that  as it completes testing of information technology and embedded systems  it will develop contingency plans if it determines that any business critical systems will not be year compliant 
disruptions with respect to the computer systems of vendors or customers  which are outside the control of the company  could impair the ability of the company to obtain services from or conduct business with its customers 
the company believes that its primary exposure is with respect to public utilities and telecommunications service providers 
the company is in the process of sending letters to these providers requesting written certification of year compliance 
disruptions of the company s utilities or telecommunications systems could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that no other providers are material to its business 
disruptions of customers computer systems could interfere with payments to the company by such customers  and therefore with the company s ability to make timely payments on its accounts  and could otherwise cause disruptions to the company s operations 
none of the company s customers  however  is individually material to the company s business and the company does not presently intend to seek certifications from its customers that their internal computer systems are year compliant 
with respect to the products sold by the company  the company has determined that  to the extent that underlying hardware platforms  operating systems applications and databases will accommodate the year date change  the company s performance management software products are year compliant 
notwithstanding its efforts to attempt to ensure that its products are year compliant  the company may experience future uncertainties and problems relating to the year date change issue  including but not limited to possible technical problems and or customer claims 
the company anticipates that virtually all of its customers and potential customers will be required to evaluate their information technology systems with respect to the year date change and that some of its customers and potential customers may incur material costs in connection with this evaluation and any necessary repairs and replacements 
customers and potential customers may be required to devote material portions of their information technology budgets to such evaluations  repairs and replacements  which could materially reduce their other information technology purchases in  including their purchases of the company s products  particularly as the year date change draws closer 
the company does not have any information as to the degree to which this issue will affect its customers or potential customers 
the company has incurred to date approximately million for year remediation activities  of which approximately million was incurred in the company currently expects to incur approximately million in for year remediation activities 
there can be no assurance that the actions taken by the company with respect to its internal information technology systems  embedded systems or its products will eliminate the numerous and varied risks associated with the year date change 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will not be adversely affected by any year related difficulties encountered by vendors or customers or by any downturn in information technology purchases or in the economy in general as the year date change draws nearer  or after such date change 
additionally  the effects of any actual year non compliance problem directly or indirectly experienced by the company could be exacerbated by the fact that the company normally experiences its largest quarterly sales for a given calendar year in the fourth quarter of each year  and invoices and receives payment for such sales in the first quarter of the following calendar year 
accordingly  should a year non compliance problem or problems affect the company s customers  the potential impact on the company s operations could be greater than if the company received these payments at the time of sale or some time other than the calendar quarter immediately after the date switch from to any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has subsidiaries in the united kingdom  spain  australia  hong kong  germany and the netherlands to act as distributors of its products 
additionally  the company uses third party distributors to market and distribute its products in other international regions 
transactions conducted by the subsidiaries are typically denominated in the local country currency  while transactions conducted by the distributors are typically denominated in us dollars 
as a result  the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of its subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and impact overall expected profitibility 
however  through and as of december   the company s exposure was not material to the overall financial statements taken as a whole 
the company has not entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency market risk 
the company does not have any financial instruments subject to material market risk  except as discussed above
