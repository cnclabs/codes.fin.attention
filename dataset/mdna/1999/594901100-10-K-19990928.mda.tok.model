the charge represents the business process re engineering costs capitalized through december  relating to micros s installation of a new management information system 
prior to this ruling  these costs had been capitalized and were to be amortized over the useful life of the system 
year the company has substantially completed the process of reviewing its business systems  and querying its customers  vendors and resellers with respect to year compliance issues 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
in  the company created a corporate wide year project team representing all business units of the company 
the team was divided into three segments  each of which was tasked with analyzing one of the following three sets of issues i year compliance issues with respect to company internal information technology systems and non information technology systems  ii year compliance issues with respect to the information systems of certain key company vendors and suppliers  and iii year compliance issues with respect to company products that the company sells and licenses to its worldwide customer base 
year compliance issues with respect to company internal systems the company s management information systems department assumed all year obligations associated with testing  analyzing and implementing the company s internal information systems 
although these activities were not formally assigned to the mis department until  the department had nonetheless embraced such as part of its implementation of new enterprise resources planning systems erp in this implementation involved replacing all internal information systems with oracle applications release as part of this implementation  the company required certification that all oracle products were year compliant  which such certification has been provided 
on march   micros upgraded the oracle erp systems to release  oracle s latest release 
this upgrade assured that all critical erp systems are fully year compliant 
moreover  the company has completed testing of all of the key components of the hardware operating the erp 
the tests did not uncover any year related issues 
internationally  the company is in the process of implementing year compliant oracle applications at certain central locations year compliance issues with respect to the information systems of certain key company vendors and suppliers in addition to internal year activities and the review and remediation of the company s internal information systems  the company is in contact with its key suppliers and vendors to assess their compliance 
the company has received to date certain assurances from these suppliers and vendors that any year issues from which they suffer will not materially adversely affect micros 
the company continues to elicit information where a vendor fails to provide responses  or fails to provide complete responses 
there can  however  be no absolute assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect on the company if third parties do not convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s systems  or fail to disclose problems in their applications or support systems 
the company believes that its current and future actions with suppliers will minimize these risks 
year compliance issues with respect to company products that the company sells and licenses to its worldwide customer base finally  the company has completed the testing of its existing standard product offerings 
the testing entailed performing an analysis of standard products using testing protocols developed internally 
while testing was not performed on each of the individual customized products defined as special products developed for individual customers  as opposed to off the shelf products offered as standard products distributed  testing was performed on defined classes of customized products 
the testing was not performed with respect to any legacy products that the company does not currently sell or support 
where testing determined that a product had year related issues  the company developed a fix  or provided the customer with a migration path to a product that is year compliant 
as part of the testing effort  micros engaged oracle corporation oracle to examine and test certain proprietary time sensitive software modules 
oracle has completed its examination  having determined that  while there were several immaterial non compliant items  the code examined was year compliant 
micros has evaluated and  if appropriate  addressed the issues identified by oracle 
while certain potential issues have been identified to date  the expense of upgrading product applications to be year compliant has not been material 
the company maintains a site on its web page  which details the products that the company will test or has tested  and the year compliance status thereof 
the site is updated approximately every four weeks 
the last update was on september  year compliance costs to date  the company has expensed all incremental costs related to the year analysis and remediation efforts 
internal and external costs specifically associated with modifying software for the year will be charged to expense as incurred 
all of these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
management s current estimate including the year issues identified to date is that the costs associated with the year issue should not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial position of the company in any given quarter 
however  the company is not certain that it has fully identified such impact or whether the company can resolve it without disruption of its business or incurring significant expense 
to date  not including the costs incurred to upgrade the company s internal management information systems  the company has incurred approximately million in expenditures related to the year issue 
costs capitalized to date to implement the company s new year compliant internal management information systems  which address a large variety of informational and processing needs  are approximately million 
the company believes it has diligently addressed the year issues and that it has satisfactorily resolved any significant year problems 
the status of all of these efforts has been provided on the company s year internet web page  which is updated monthly 
in the remaining months of  the company will continue to pursue the following three efforts i testing and  if necessary  correcting certain customized products that have been offered  ii responding to any new issues that may be identified  whether those in the company s products  or in third party products on which the operation of the company s products are dependent  and iii finalizing the customer support plans worldwide for the anticipated increase in calls and questions during the three month period commencing december  contingency plans the company is currently developing a contingency plan for its products 
this plan includes having had oracle test and verify certain products  and increasing current staffing levels in customer service functions for the three month period commencing december  while the company believes that its current product set will not have any material year issues  the company anticipates increased call volume during this period 
with respect to internal information systems  micros does not intend to develop a full contingency plan involving implementation of an actual back up enterprise resource planning system 
given the complexity of the company s oracle enterprise resource planning system  it is neither practical nor cost effective to develop such a back up contingency approach 
for this reason  and as noted above  micros has thoroughly tested and certified the current internal systems so as to reduce the risk that problems have not been identified and addressed prior to january  additionally  in order to test further the internal systems  micros scheduled and now has completed a dry run test in august of  during which the dates contained in the enterprise resource planning system were scrolled forward to january  these tests did not uncover any year related issues  and the systems performed without any failures or inaccuracies 
however  year issues in the company s enterprise resource planning system  if gone undetected or uncorrected  could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
euro conversion on january   certain member nations of the european economic and monetary union emu adopted a common currency  the euro 
for a three year transition period  both the euro and individual participants currencies will remain in circulation 
after june   the euro will be the sole legal tender for emu countries 
the adoption of the euro will affect a multitude of financial systems and business applications as the commerce of these nations will be transacted in the euro and the existing national currency during the transition period 
as of june   of the eleven countries currently admitted to the emu  the company has subsidiary operations in six of those countries and distributor relationships in the remaining five countries 
micros is currently addressing euro related issues and its impact on information systems  currency exchange rate risk  taxation  contracts  competition and pricing 
action plans currently being implemented are expected to result in compliance with all laws and regulations  however  there can be no certainty that such plans will be successfully implemented or that external factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
moreover  there is still some uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of certain euro regulations  and the impact of the regulations on the company s euro implementation 
any costs associated with the adoption of the euro will be expensed as incurred 
the company currently does not expect these costs to be material to its results of operations  financial condition or liquidity
