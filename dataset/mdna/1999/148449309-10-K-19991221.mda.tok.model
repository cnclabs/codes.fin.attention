item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations s omitted except share amounts results of operations general from august to september   two of the company s subsidiaries conducted refining operations 
by december   the company s refining subsidiaries had sold all of their refining assets 
in addition  powerine merged into a subsidiary of emc and was no longer a subsidiary of the company 
the company s other refining subsidiary  irlp  owns no refining assets and is in the process of liquidation 
as a result  the company has accounted for its refining operations as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements as of september  and retroactively 
accordingly  discussion of results of operations has been confined to the results of continuing operations and the anticipated impact  if any  of liquidation of the company s remaining inactive refining subsidiary and contingent environmental liabilities of the company or its refining subsidiaries 
as noted above  the company sold its rusk county  texas oil and gas properties and pipeline to uprc and its subsidiary  respectively  in may the oil and gas reserves sold approximated of the company s proved oil and gas reserves at the date of sale 
as a result operations applicable to the assets sold impacted consolidated operations for eight months in fiscal and not at all thereafter 
also  as noted above  ceci acquired the oil and gas properties of ambrit on june  the oil and gas reserves associated with the acquisition were estimated at approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas and  barrels of crude oil or roughly of the reserves owned by the company before the acquisition 
furthermore  as a result of the acquisition  the company s production of oil and gas increased by approximately 
this acquisition impacted consolidated operations for the last four months of fiscal only 
gas sales and purchases ceased effective may  by virtue of the scheduled termination of its subsidiaries gas sales and gas purchase contracts with lone star and mgng 
the company has not replaced these contracts because it sold its pipeline assets to a subsidiary of uprc in may and because it is unlikely that similar profitable long term contracts can be negotiated since most gas purchasers buy gas on the spot market 
although the company is currently seeking additional natural gas marketing operations  it is currently operating exclusively in the exploration and production segment of the energy industry 
as a result natural gas marketing operations impacted consolidated operations for all of fiscal and fiscal but only the first eight months of fiscal fiscal vs fiscal natural gas marketing gas sales from natural gas marketing decreased  or from fiscal to gas sales in each fiscal year consist of the following september  gas sales to lone star   gas sales to mgng   gas sales to third parties gas sales to lone star and mgng decreased from fiscal to fiscal because both of the relevant gas sales contracts terminated may  by their own terms 
the natural gas volumes sold during the period october  to may  were the remaining contractual volumes required under the related long term gas sales contracts with lone star and mgng 
the gas prices received by the company s natural gas marketing subsidiary were essentially fixed both years so that the decreases in sales under both the lone star contract and the contract with mgng were caused by decreased volumes delivered 
gas purchases gas purchases decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal gas purchases in each of the fiscal years consist of the following september gas purchases lone star contract   gas purchases mgng contract   gas purchases sales to third parties gas purchases decreased because the related long term gas supply contracts with mgng terminated and the company ceased buying gas supplies on the spot market on may   the same day that the lone star contract terminated 
the gas price paid by the company under such long term gas supply agreement with mgng was essentially fixed for approximately ninety percent of volumes purchased 
the gas price paid for the remaining ten percent of gas supplies was based upon a market index price 
the gross margin percentage natural gas purchases as a percentage of natural gas sales was essentially the same both years in fiscal and in fiscal general and administrative general and administrative costs decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  the decrease was attributable to the termination of a natural gas hedging consulting arrangement on may   the date the company s long term gas contracts terminated 
transportation transportation expense decreased or from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  transportation expense is based upon and thus proportional to deliveries made to lone star and represents the amortization of a  prepaid transportation asset received by one of the company s subsidiaries in the sale of the castle pipeline to a subsidiary of uprc in may deliveries to lone star were approximately greater during the year ended september  than during the year ended september  because deliveries to lone star ceased on may  by may   the  allocated to prepaid transportation had been completely amortized 
amortization amortization of gas contracts decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease is entirely attributable to the termination of the lone star contract on may  for fiscal twelve months of amortization are included in operations versus only eight months of amortization in fiscal both the lone star contract and the mgng contract expired may  during the year ended september   the operating income from these contracts was  or of consolidated operating income 
for the year ended september   the operating income from these contracts was  or approximately of consolidated operating income for the period 
the company has not replaced these contracts because it sold its pipeline assets to a subsidiary of uprc in may and because it is unlikely that similar profitable long term contracts can be negotiated since most gas purchasers buy gas on the spot market 
although the company is currently seeking additional natural gas marketing operations  it is currently operating exclusively in the exploration and production segment of the energy industry 
the company is currently seeking to replace some or all of the operating income contribution of its former natural gas marketing operations with operating income from additional exploration and production properties and other energy assets 
in that respect  the company acquired the oil and gas assets of ambrit  has entered into two drilling ventures in south texas and has acquired a interest in a drilling concession in romania 
in addition  subsequent to september   the company acquired outside interests in wells it operates for and entered into agreements to acquire other oil and gas properties see above and note included in the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company is also currently reviewing several other possible exploration and production  pipeline and natural gas marketing acquisitions 
there can  however  be no assurance the company will succeed in these efforts 
exploration and production on june   the company purchased all of ambrit s oil and gas properties for  net of purchase price adjustments 
ambrit s oil and gas properties consist primarily of proved developed producing reserves 
the current production from the ambrit properties is approximately that of the company s other properties 
in addition  the oil and gas reserves associated with the acquisition are estimated to be approximately of the company s other reserves 
therefore  as a result of this acquisition  the company s exploration and production operations have increased significantly since june  in order to facilitate comparisons of financial data we have separately disclosed changes applicable to the acquisition of the ambrit properties and those applicable to the company s other exploration and production operations 
the results are as follows less amounts applicable effect of to acquisition non ambrit properties change of ambrit on consolidated properties year ended operating year ended june  september  year ended income september  september  as september  increase adjusted decrease revenues oil and gas sales     well operations expenses oil and gas   general and administrative   depreciation  depletion and amortization   operating income loss   although the company has also invested in two exploration ventures in south texas and a drilling concession in romania  production from such ventures  if any  has not yet commenced 
no proved reserves have been associated with any of these ventures 
revenues oil and gas sales oil and gas sales on non ambrit properties increased or from fiscal to fiscal most of the increase is attributable to a increase in production 
although oil and gas prices have recently increased significantly  they were lower during much of the year ended september  at september   the company had hedged of its anticipated oil production and of its anticipated gas production for the year ended september  the crude oil was hedged at an average new york mercantile exchange nymex price of per barrel and the natural gas was hedged at an average price of per mcf 
the price the company receives for its production differs from the nymex pricing due to its location basis differentials 
however  management believes the nymex pricing is highly correlated to its production field prices and expects to be able to apply hedge accounting to these derivative transactions 
to the extent that futures nymex oil and gas prices average less than the prices at which the company has hedged production  the company s future oil and gas sales will increase above that which results from the sale of production at market prices 
conversely  to the extent that futures nymex prices exceed the average prices at which the company has hedged its production  the company s future oil and gas sales will decrease below that which results from the sale of production at market prices 
at september   the company had not hedged and of its anticipated crude oil and natural gas production  respectively 
as a result  the company remains exposed to oil and gas price risk on this unhedged production 
as a result of the acquisition of the ambrit oil and gas properties  the company expects that its revenues from oil and gas sales will increase significantly in the future 
well operations revenue from non ambrit well operations increased or from fiscal to fiscal the increase was primarily caused by the non recurring recovery of operating fees in that had been written off in prior years 
expenses oil and gas production oil and gas production expenses increased or from fiscal to fiscal the increase in oil and gas production expenses results from operating expenses related to eight new wells drilled in fiscal in which the company has an interest and the general maturing of the company s oil and gas properties and the tendency for older  depleting properties to carry a higher production expense burden than recently drilled properties 
in fiscal oil and gas production expense comprised of oil and gas sales versus of oil and gas sales in fiscal for the period july  to september   oil and gas production expenses related to the ambrit properties comprised of related oil and gas sales from ambrit properties 
since oil and gas production expenses generally increase as wells deplete  the company expects that the oil and gas production expense percentage oil and gas production expense as a percentage of oil and gas sales will increase in the future given fixed oil and gas prices 
such increase may  however  be offset by a lower percentage of oil and gas production expenses to oil and gas sales for the company s interests in new wells which the company expects to be drilled 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization from non ambrit properties increased or from fiscal to fiscal approximately of the increase is attributable to a higher depletion rate per equivalent mcf produced 
the higher depletion rate results from the acquisition of the ambrit properties and the accounting requirement under full cost accounting that depreciation  depletion and amortization be computed on a consolidated basis by country not on a separate property or field basis 
prior to the acquisition of the ambrit properties  the company s amortization rate per equivalent mcf produced was 
whereas after the acquisition the company s rate was approximately 
per equivalent mcf produced 
the remaining of the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization was caused by a increase in production 
corporate general and administrative expense corporate general and administrative expenses increased  or from fiscal to fiscal most of the increase was caused by increased consulting fees applicable to due diligence for possible acquisitions 
increased employee bonuses and increased legal costs also contributed to the increase 
other income expense interest income interest income decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the average balance of unrestricted cash outstanding during the periods being compared 
in june  the company paid  net of purchase price for ambrit s oil and gas properties 
in addition  during the year ended september   the company spent  to acquire shares of its common stock 
other income expense the composition of other income expense is as follows year ended september  write down of investment in penn octane corporation preferred stock market price adjustment of investment in penn octane corporation common stock litigation recovery emc miscellaneous the write down of the company s investment in the preferred stock of penn octane corporation penn octane  a public company selling liquid propane gas to northern mexico  was based upon the company s calculation of the loss that would be incurred if the company converted its shares of penn octane preferred stock and sold the resulting common shares unregistered at a discount to the market price given the thin capitalization of penn octane and low trading volumes in its stock 
subsequently  the company converted all of its penn octane preferred stock to penn octane common stock 
the market price adjustment relates to the company s investment in penn octane common stock 
until june   the company classified penn octane securities as trading securities because all except  of the  common shares owned by the company were registered and the company did not expect to hold its penn octane investment for the long term 
according to current generally accepted accounting principles  such securities were valued at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses included in earnings 
the favorable market adjustment resulted from the increase in the market price of penn octane common stock as of june  effective june   the company reclassified its investment in penn octane common stock as available for sale securities because the company was not actively buying and selling penn octane securities 
at september   the market value of the company s investment in penn octane stock exceeded the company s cost by  this unrealized gain  less of estimated income taxes  has been recorded as other comprehensive income pursuant to sfas at september   the company owned  shares of penn octane common stock representing approximately of outstanding stock at september the litigation recovery was a non recurring gain related to the powerine emc litigation occurring in the second fiscal quarter of for which there was no counterpart during the year ended september  provision for income taxes the tax provisions for the year ended september  and consist of the following components year ended september  increase in net deferred tax asset using federal and state blended tax rate  utilization of deferred tax asset  net of related valuation reserves  using blended federal and state tax rate   a tax provision of on all net income in excess of that required to realize the net deferred tax asset 
this rate represents alternative minimum federal corporate taxes the company must pay despite having tax carryforwards and credits available to offset regular federal corporate tax other primarily revisions of previous estimates the tax provision for the year ended september   consists primarily of a tax provision of  utilization of deferred tax asset and an offsetting reversal of tax estimates and contingencies of  the company evaluated its need for a deferred tax valuation allowance at september  based upon positive evidence confirming the company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the deferred tax asset available and recorded a deferred tax asset  net of valuation reserves  of  the tax provision for the year ended september   consists of utilization of the  of remaining net deferred tax assets at september   of federal alternative minimum taxes on net income in excess of that required to fully utilize the  net deferred tax asset using a blended tax rate and of other taxes related to revisions to the prior year s taxable income 
the fiscal blended federal and state income tax rate was  which is lower than the statutory rate due to the utilization of statutory depletion and tax credits 
the company did not record a net deferred tax asset at september  because it determined that future taxable income was less certain given the company s large exploratory and wildcat drilling programs  the expiration of the lone star contract  contingent environmental liabilities and other factors 
earnings per share since november  the company has repurchased  or of its common shares 
as a result of these share acquisitions  earnings per share are higher than they would be if no shares had been repurchased 
fiscal vs fiscal natural gas marketing and transmission gas sales from natural gas marketing increased  or from fiscal to gas sales in each fiscal year consist of the following september  gas sales to lone star   gas sales to mgng   gas sales to third parties lone star contract natural gas sales under the lone star contract increased  or from fiscal to fiscal under the company s long term gas sales contract with lone star  the price received for gas is essentially fixed through may  the variance in gas sales  therefore  is almost entirely attributable to the volumes of gas delivered 
although the volumes sold to lone star annually are essentially fixed the lone star contract has a take or pay provision  the lone star contract year is from february to january whereas the company s fiscal year is from october to september furthermore  although the volumes to be taken by lone star in a given contract year are fixed  there is no provision requiring equal monthly or daily volumes and deliveries accordingly vary with lone star s seasonal and peak demands 
such variances have been significant 
as a result  lone star deliveries  although fixed for a contract year  may be skewed and not proportional for the company s fiscal periods 
for fiscal  sales to lone star were approximately more than those which would have resulted if daily deliveries had been fixed and equal 
at september   the remaining volumes to be delivered under the lone star contract were approximately greater than those that would be delivered if daily deliveries were fixed and equal 
mgng contract gas sales to mgng remained the same in fiscal as in fiscal because the gas sales contract with mgng requires a fixed daily volume of gas at a fixed price and the mgng contract was in force for all of the periods being compared 
gas purchases gas purchases increased  or from fiscal to fiscal gas purchases in each of the fiscal years consist of the following september gas purchases lone star contract   gas purchases mgng contract   gas purchases sales to third parties gas purchases for the lone star contract increased  or from fiscal to fiscal for fiscal gas purchases comprised of gas sales versus of gas sales for fiscal from to the gross margin increased  or 
during the same periods the gross margin percentage gas sales gas purchases as a percentage of gas sales increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in gas purchases as a percentage of gas sales and the concomitant increase in gross margin percentage for the lone star contract resulted primarily from non recurring favorable adjustments of gas purchase costs in fiscal and the replacement of high price gas contracts expiring in april with lower market price contracts 
gas purchases for the contract with mgng increased or from fiscal to fiscal the gas sales volumes sold to mgng for each of the two years being compared were equal  hence the increase is entirely attributable to increased market prices for gas  net of hedging effects 
gas purchased for third parties increased from zero in fiscal to in fiscal the gas sales to third parties in fiscal resulted because lone star limited its daily gas purchases to of volumes nominated and the company had to sell the excess gas elsewhere 
the restriction of daily sales to of volumes nominated did not  however  affect annual volumes that lone star was required to take under the lone star contract 
in august  the company hedged all of its remaining unhedged gas requirements 
as a result of such hedging  the company had fixed its price exposure on its gas sales contract with mgng through may   the termination date for the contract 
operating costs operating costs decreased to a recovery of for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  because the texas pipeline was sold to uprc in may and as of june  the company no longer incurred operating costs to operate the texas pipeline 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  most general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended september  related to the texas pipeline  which was sold in may the remaining administrative expenses consist primarily of consulting fees for on going gas marketing operations 
transportation transportation expense increased  from for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  during the period october  to may   one of the company s subsidiaries owned and operated the texas pipeline and all transportation revenues were for intercompany transportation and were accordingly eliminated in consolidation of the company s financial statements 
on may   the company sold the texas pipeline to a subsidiary of uprc 
in both and  transportation expense consisted entirely of the amortization of a  prepaid transportation asset 
amortization is based upon and thus proportional to deliveries made to lone star 
in fiscal  four months transportation expense was recorded versus twelve months transportation expense in fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased  or from fiscal fiscal the decrease is attributable to the sale of the texas pipeline to a subsidiary of uprc in may as a result of the sale  the company no longer owned or depreciated the texas pipeline 
exploration and production as noted above  the company sold its texas oil and gas properties to uprc in may the reserves sold represented approximately of the company s proved oil and gas reserves and of the company s oil and gas production at the time of sale 
comparison of fiscal oil and gas sales  production expenses  general and administrative expenses and depletion  depreciation and amortization to those in fiscal is thus not meaningful 
accordingly  exploration and production operations comparisons and analysis have been limited to operations from those oil and gas properties which were not sold to uprc 
the related operating results for such properties are as follows year ended september  revenues oil and gas sales   well operations expenses oil and gas production general and administrative depreciation  depletion and amortization operating income  revenues oil and gas sales oil and gas sales decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease is attributable to decreased oil and gas prices and decreased production 
many of the company s oil and gas reserves are mature reserves and such decreased production is expected 
although the company has participated in drilling twenty three new wells and several reworks on existing wells from july through september   production from such new drilling activities has only recently begun impacting operations 
the company is also reviewing possible investments in other oil and gas drilling programs and oil and gas property acquisitions  including several requiring substantial investment 
as a result  the company expects that  if it is successful in making acquisitions  its oil and gas sales will eventually increase given stable oil and gas sales prices 
however  there can be no assurance that wells expected to be drilled will actually be drilled  that such drilling will be successful or that the company will be successful in making acquisitions or that oil and gas sales will increase 
well operations revenue from well operations decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease is attributable to the company s resignation as operator on certain appalachian wells in fiscal where a non operator offered to operate the wells at a cost significantly less than that being incurred by the company in performing such operations 
the related well operations revenues were not replaced 
expenses oil and gas production oil and gas production expenses increased or from fiscal to fiscal the increase in oil and gas production expenses results from the general maturing of the company s oil and gas properties and the tendency for older  depleting properties to carry a higher production expense burden than recently drilled properties 
furthermore  oil and gas production expenses  especially non capitalized repairs  do not generally occur evenly each year and are best compared on a cumulative rather than on an annual basis 
there can be no assurance  however  that such will be the case 
general and administrative general and administrative costs increased or from fiscal to the fiscal the net increase was primarily attributable to higher employee costs and bonuses  higher consulting fees and increased legal costs 
the increase was offset to a minor extent by tax refunds and vendor settlements in fiscal for which there was no counterpart in fiscal depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased or from fiscal to the fiscal the decrease is attributable to slightly decreased production and significantly lower depletion rate per unit of production 
the lower depletion rate results primarily from the company s sale of of its proved oil and gas reserves to uprc 
other income expense gain on sale of assets in may  the company s subsidiaries sold their texas oil and gas assets and pipeline to uprc  resulting in a  gain 
there was no counterpart in fiscal interest income interest income increased or from fiscal to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the average balance of invested unrestricted cash 
for the year ended september   of interest income was attributable to a note receivable from mg related to the powerine arbitration and resulted from the investment of excess cash 
for the year ended september   was attributable to interest on the mg note  was attributable to interest on a note from penn octane corporation penn octane  a public company involved in liquid petroleum and compressed natural gas business  and the remaining  was attributable to the investment of excess cash 
interest on the mg note ceased on october  interest expense interest expense decreased  from  for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  because the company repaid all of its long term debt in may with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its texas oil and gas properties and pipeline to uprc 
penn octane note in october  the company invested  in a promissary note of penn octane 
the note bears interest at payable quarterly and was due on june  at june   penn octane did not repay the note 
in may of  penn octane was awarded a judgement against a bank and such judgement is in excess of the  owed to the company by penn octane 
in december  penn octane assigned its interest in the bank judgement to the extent of the company s note to the company in return for an extension of the note until june  the company also received  warrants to purchase the common stock of penn octane for one dollar and seventy five cents per share as consideration for the extension 
the bank owing the judgement has appealed it and such appeal may not be resolved for a year or more 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the judgement will be upheld upon appeal or that the bank will ultimately pay the judgement won by penn octane to the company 
if the note is not repaid by its extended due date  the company intends to reduce the penn octane note to its estimated realizable value  if any 
gamxx on february   the company entered into an agreement with alexander allen  inc aa concerning amounts owed to the company by aa and its subsidiary  gamxx energy  inc gamxx 
the company had made loans to gamxx through in the aggregate amount of approximately  when gamxx was unable to obtain financing  the company recorded a one hundred percent loss provision on its loans to gamxx in and while still retaining its lender s lien against gamxx 
pursuant to the terms of the gamxx agreement  the company is to receive  cash in settlement for its loans when gamxx closes on its financing 
gamxx expected such closing not later than may  but such closing has not yet occurred 
the company has carried its loans to gamxx at zero the last six years 
the company will record the  proceeds as other income if and when it collects such amount 
there can be no assurance that gamxx will close on its financing 
provision for income taxes as a result of the tax benefit recorded in fiscal  the company expected to provide for income taxes at a blended statutory rate for the remainder of the lone star contract for book purposes 
during this period the company expected to pay income taxes  however  at a effective rate  consisting of federal alternative minimum tax 
the company s tax provision for fiscal consists of two components a 
the tax provision on pre tax accounting income  exclusive of the  gain on the sale of assets  aggregates  and essentially represents the partial utilization of the  deferred tax asset recorded at september  at an effective rate of of earnings 
if future events change the company s estimate concerning the probability of utilizing its tax assets  appropriate adjustments will be made when such a conclusion is reached 
b 
the tax provision on the  gain equals the company s expected tax liability for the income related to the sale and aggregates the tax rate used in such calculation was  the federal alternative minimum tax rate 
the company is not yet subject to a higher tax rate due to its tax carryforwards 
a tax provision of was not provided for the gain because a related deferred tax asset was not previously provided since the company did not anticipate selling the properties and had previously taken the properties off the market 
the tax provision for the year ended september  consists primarily of a tax provision of  utilization of deferred tax asset and an offsetting reversal of tax estimates and contingencies of  the company evaluated its need for a deferred tax valuation allowance at september  based upon recent positive evidence confirming the company s ability to utilize its tax carryforwards 
earnings per share since november  the company has reacquired  shares of its common stock 
as a result of these share acquisitions  earnings per outstanding share have been higher than would be the case if no shares had been repurchased liquidity and capital resources all statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this report generally are accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  or expect or similar statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove correct 
factors that could cause the company s results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements are disclosed in this report  including without limitation in conjunction with the expected cash sources and expected cash obligations discussed below 
all forward looking statements in this form k are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph 
furthermore  this statement constitutes a year readiness disclosure statement and the statements contained herein are subject to the year information and readiness disclosure act act 
in case of a dispute  this document and information contained herein are entitled to protection of the act 
during the year ended september   the company generated  from operating activities 
during the same period the company invested  in oil and gas properties and  to reacquire shares of its common stock 
in addition  it paid  in stockholder dividends 
at september   the company had  of unrestricted cash   of working capital and no long term debt 
discontinued refining operations although the company s former and present subsidiaries have exited the refining business and third parties have assumed environmental liabilities  if any  of such subsidiaries  the company and several of its subsidiaries remain liable for contingent environmental liabilities see item and note to the financial statements included in item of this form k 
expected sources and uses of funds as of november   the estimated future cash expenditures of the company for the next two fiscal years consist of the following a 
investments in oil and gas properties and other energy sector ventures subsequent to september   the company spent to acquire outside interests in gas wells it operated in alabama 
during this period the company also entered into agreements to purchase additional outside interests in the alabama wells  to purchase majority interests in several pennsylvania wells and to purchase majority interests in louisiana offshore wells 
the total cost to the company  after purchase price adjustments  and assuming all three transactions are consummated  is approximately  in addition  the company anticipates the following exploration and drilling expenditures over the next two fiscal years development drilling on existing acreage  south texas exploratory drilling ventures  romanian concession  if the initial drilling results in the south texas drilling ventures are less favorable than anticipated  the company expects to be able to reduce this drilling commitment by approximately  conversely  if the initial results are better than expected the company may participate in the drilling of more wells than budgeted above 
if the initial wildcat romanian wells are successful  the company may also increase its investment in that country significantly and could conceivably spend  if new oil and gas fields are discovered 
in addition  the company is currently pursuing several other possible material investments in the energy sector 
these possible investments include drilling ventures  the acquisition of oil and gas properties and oil and gas companies  as well as the acquisition of pipelines and gas marketing operations 
although most of these possible investments involve domestic properties  some involve investments overseas 
although the company has concluded several transactions and believes it can conclude an additional transaction or several transactions on terms favorable to the company  there can be no assurance that such will be the case 
oil and gas prices have recently increased significantly and many potential sellers have decided not to sell or have not been forced to sell by their lenders 
in addition  several sellers have raised the price for the oil gas properties they are selling given currently high oil and gas prices and acquisition of such properties at such high prices would not be in the company s best interest 
in addition  several large oil and gas companies have significantly more resources than the company and other parties may be willing to pay more than the company for a given acquisition 
b 
repurchase of company shares as of november   the company had repurchased  of its shares of common stock at a cost of  the company s board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to  shares to provide an exit vehicle for investors who want to liquidate their investment in the company 
the decision whether to repurchase additional shares and or to increase the repurchase authorization above  shares will depend upon the market price of the company s stock  tax considerations  the number of stockholders seeking to sell their shares and other factors 
c 
recurring dividends the company s board of directors adopted a policy of paying a 
per share annual dividend 
per share quarterly in june of the company expects to continue to pay such dividend until the board of directors  in its sole discretion  changes such policy 
at september   the company had available the following sources of funds unrestricted cash september   line of credit energy bank  marketable securities  in addition  the company anticipates significant future cash flow from exploration and production operations 
the estimated sources of funds are subject to most of the risks enumerated below 
the realization from the sale of the company s investment in penn octane is dependent on the market value of such stock and the company s ability to liquidate its penn octane stock investment at or near market values 
since penn octane is thinly capitalized and traded  liquidation of a large volume of penn octane stock without significantly lowering the market price may be impossible 
the company thus expects that it can fund all of its present drilling commitments from its own unrestricted cash 
the company can also use its unrestricted cash and future cash flow  as well as up to  from it line of credit  to acquire additional oil and gas properties and to conduct additional drilling 
as a result  the company believes it has available the financing to make additional future acquisitions of up to approximately  while still funding its existing drilling commitments 
the company has also negotiated with several potential industry partners who may provide financing if the company decides to make an acquisition for prices in excess of these amounts 
the company s future operations are subject to the following risks contingent environmental liabilities although the company has never itself conducted refining operations and its refining subsidiaries have exited the refining business and the company does not anticipate any required expenditures related to discontinued refining operations  interested parties could seek redress from the company for environmental liabilities 
in the past  government and other plaintiffs have often named the most financially capable parties in such cases regardless of the existence or extent of actual liability 
as a result there exists the possibility that the company could be named for any environmental claims related to discontinued refining operations of its present and former refining subsidiaries 
the company was informed that the epa has investigated offsite acid sludge waste found near the indian refinery and was also remediating surface contamination in the indian refinery property 
neither the company nor irlp has been named with respect to these two actions 
in october  the epa named the company and two of its subsidiaries as potentially responsible parties for the expected clean up of the indian refinery 
in addition  eighteen other parties were named including texaco refining and marketing  inc  the refinery operator for over years 
the company subsequently responded to the epa indicating that it was neither the owner nor operator of the indian refinery and thus not responsible for its remediation 
in november  the company received a request for information from the epa concerning the company s involvement in the ownership and operation of the indian refinery 
the company expects to respond to the epa information request in the second quarter of fiscal estimated undiscounted clean up costs for the indian refinery are  to  according to third parties 
if the company were found liable for the remediation of the indian refinery  it could be required to pay a percentage of the clean up costs 
since the company s subsidiary only operated the indian refinery five years whereas texaco and others operated it over years  the company would expect that its share of any remediation liability would be proportional to its years of operation although such may not be the case 
although the company does not believe it has any liabilities with respect to the environmental liabilities of the refineries  a court of competent jurisdiction may find otherwise 
a decision by the us supreme court in june in a comparable case supports the company s position 
the above estimate of expected cash resources and cash obligations assumes no expenditure for legal defense costs related to the indian refinery 
if the company is sued and related legal proceedings continue longer than expected environmental litigation often continues years or more and or the company is found liable for a portion of the environmental remediation of either the indian refinery or powerine refinery  estimated cash resources will be decreased and such decrease could be significant 
irlp vendor liabilities irlp owes its vendors approximately  its only major asset was a  note due from the purchaser of the indian refinery  american western 
we have recently been informed that irlp has agreed to settle its  note for approximately in exchange for a covenant of the epa not to sue irlp 
assuming such a settlement is consummated  irlp will be able to pay its creditors only a small portion of the amounts owed to them 
larry long litigation the above cash flow assumes the company will not have to pay any claim related to the larry long litigation 
although the sale of the company s texas oil and gas properties and pipeline to uprc have significantly reduced the company s exposure  there can be no assurance that the plaintiffs will not file new lawsuits  having already amended their original complaint three times 
in such case  the company would be exposed to the continuing legal costs of defending the amended petitions  and  if it is determined that settlement is in the company s best interest  the cost to settle the lawsuit 
public market for the company s stock although there presently exists a market for the company s stock  such market is volatile and the company s stock is thinly traded 
such volatility may adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company  through its stock repurchase program  has repurchased  or of its outstanding common stock since november of and has effectively become the major market maker in the company s stock 
if the company ceases repurchasing shares the market value of the company s stock may be adversely affected 
year the company has completed a study of the year issue and related risks 
as a result of the study  the company has replaced its oil and gas and general ledger software with new software which is year compliant 
total costs to purchase and install the new system were the company commenced using the new software in the first quarter of fiscal and has encountered no significant problems to date 
the company has also made inquiries to outside parties who process transactions of the company  eg  payroll  commercial banks  transfer agent  reserve engineers  etc 
while most outside parties have confirmed they are year compliant  a few have not done so to the company s satisfaction 
the company is continuing to pursue the vendors whose responses appear to provide insufficient assurance 
the most important systems operated by the company are its revenue distribution  joint interest billing and general ledger systems 
the company installed new systems because the new systems are year compliant 
if a year problem nevertheless occurred  the company could process transactions for several months manually or using small computers but only with increased administrative costs 
nevertheless  in many cases  the company is not the operator of a given well or purchaser of oil and gas production 
in those cases the company is dependent upon the operator and or gas oil purchaser for accurate volumetric  cost and sales information and for payments 
although the company has made year inquiries of such operators and purchasers and generally received satisfactory responses  there can be no assurance that such operators and purchasers will actually be year compliant 
if such is the case  the company could find a portion of its production revenue held in escrow until year compliance was achieved or resulting litigation settled 
the related legal cost and resulting administrative confusion could be substantial 
the company has made contingency plans in the event of non compliance of its systems  but can do little in the case of non compliance by outside operators and oil gas purchasers 
if outside operators and or purchasers experience major year disruptions  the company s cash flow would be negatively impacted 
if such outside operators and or purchasers were unable to record production and disburse payments  the company s share of production proceeds could be tied up for several months until the disruptions are fixed and retroactive processing is completed 
since three oil and gas purchasers buy in excess of of the company s current production  the impact on the company of any one or more of the three experiencing year problems could be substantial 
although most operators and purchasers have provided some written assurance that they are or will be year compliant  such may not be the case 
the company and its subsidiaries are not aware of any material year operational risks with respect to wells it operates 
foreign operating risks since the company anticipates spending a minimum of approximately  drilling a romanian concession of which was incurred by september   the company s interests are subject to certain foreign country risks over which the company has no control including political risk  currency risk  the risk of additional taxation and the possibility that foreign operating requirements and procedures may reduce or eliminate estimated profitability 
exploration and production reserve risk the company is currently participating in several drilling ventures 
most of these ventures involve exploratory drilling where the probability of discovering commercial oil and gas reserves is less than fifty percent 
the drilling investment is essentially a sunk cost 
reserve risk is the possibility that the reserves discovered  if any  will not approximate those the company has estimated before drilling 
if commercial reserves are not found the company s future operations and cash flow will be adversely affected 
exploration and production price risk the company has hedged approximately of its anticipated crude oil production and of its anticipated natural gas production for the year ended september  at prices which are expected to provide profitable margins 
the company has not hedged any of its anticipated oil and gas production beyond december because the cost to do so appears excessive when compared to the risk involved 
as a result of the company remains exposed to future oil and gas price changes with respect to approximately of its estimated crude oil production and of its anticipated natural gas production through september and virtually all of its anticipated oil and gas production thereafter 
such exposure could be considerable given the volatility of oil and gas prices 
for example  from february to october  crude oil prices essentially doubled 
in the past crude oil prices and gas prices have shown general volatility over short periods of time 
exploration and production operating risk all of the company s current oil and gas properties are onshore properties with relatively low operating risk 
as noted above  the company acquired a fifty percent interest in a romanian oil and gas concession in fiscal and is currently involved in seismic and other pre drilling activities in that country 
in addition  in may  the company entered into an agreement to acquire majority interests in twenty six offshore louisiana wells for which the company will be the operator 
the operating risks associated with the romanian drilling concession and the louisiana offshore wells expected to be acquired are significantly greater than those associated with the operation of onshore wells 
operations in romania may  for example  be impacted by the lack of rig availability or access to operating supplies  equipment  skilled operating personnel or by excessive governmental regulations 
although the company will not operate any romanian wells it is affected by and bears fifty percent of the costs related to the such operating activities 
in louisiana  where the company expects to become operator  operations will be impacted by the inherent difficulties of producing crude oil in offshore waters including but not limited to the necessity of transporting crude oil by barge and operating the producing wells from a drilling platform rather than from dry land 
other risks in addition to the specific risks noted above  the company is subject to general business risks  including insurance claims in excess of insurance coverage  tax liabilities resulting from tax audits and the risks associated with the increased litigation that appears to affect most corporations 
future of the company the oil and gas industry is a dynamic constantly changing industry 
in the last five years the rate of mergers and acquisitions within the industry has accelerated significantly as companies seek to consolidate operations  shed unprofitable operations and reduce administrative costs 
although the company has recently acquired the oil and gas assets of ambrit and invested in other oil and gas acquisitions  there can be no assurance that the company will not become the acquisition target of another larger oil and gas company 
as a result  the company s board of directors may decide to pursue other courses of action  including but not limited to liquidation  sale of assets  merger or other reorganization 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company has hedged approximately percent of its estimated consolidated crude oil production approximately  barrels per month and of its estimated natural gas production approximately  mcf per month through september  using futures contracts 
the company has also hedged approximately of its anticipated natural gas production for the year ended september  the average hedged prices based on nymex prices are per barrel for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas 
the price the company receives for production differs from the nymex pricing due to its location basis differentials 
however  management believes that nymex pricing is highly correlated to its production field prices and expects to be able to apply hedge accounting to these derivative transactions 
the company therefore remains at risk primarily with respect to its unhedged production 
if oil and gas market prices increase  oil and gas revenues applicable to the unhedged production will increase 
if oil and gas market prices decrease  oil and gas revenues related to such unhedged production will decrease 
based upon the volumes hedged at september   future oil and gas sales would increase approximately if nymex prices decreased 
conversely  future oil and gas sales would decrease approximately if nymex prices increased 
the company also remains at risk with respect to differences between the exchange prices on the new york mercantile exchange and the field or spot prices it receives with respect to its production 
inflation and changing prices exploration and production oil and gas sales are determined by markets locally and worldwide and often move inversely to inflation 
whereas operating expenses related to oil and gas sales may be expected to parallel inflation  such costs have often tended to move more in response to oil and gas sales prices than in response to inflation 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas regarding reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
the components of comprehensive income refer to revenues  expenses  gains and losses that are excluded from net income under current accounting standards  including foreign currency translation items  minimum pension liability adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas requires that all items recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement displayed in equal prominence with the other financial statements  the total of other comprehensive income for a period is required to be transferred to a component of equity that is separately displayed in a statement of financial condition at the end of an accounting period 
sfas was effective for both interim and annual periods for companies having fiscal years beginning after december  reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes was required 
the company adopted sfas  effective october  in june  fasb issued financial accounting standards board no 
sfas regarding disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas established standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and required the reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders 
it also established standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
sfas was effective for companies having fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted sfas no 
as of october  the provisions of sfas have not materially changed the company s disclosures and reported financial information to the present because the company has presented the required segment information in its consolidated statements of operations for several years before sfas was effective and continue to do so 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june sfas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income not included in earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness  as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss  is reported in earnings immediately 
accounting for foreign currency hedges is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
if the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company anticipates that it will adopt sfas effective october  as noted above  the company has hedged much of its anticipated oil and gas production for the fiscal year ended september  the company currently accounts for its crude oil and natural gas hedges pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for futures contracts sfas and expects to do so until adoption of sfas is required 
under sfas gains and losses from hedging activities are credited or debited to the item being hedged 
for natural gas marketing hedging activities  the item being hedged was gas purchases 
for exploration and production hedges  the item being hedged is oil and gas sales 
the company has not yet determined the impact of sfas on its financial condition or results of operations 
risk factors see above
