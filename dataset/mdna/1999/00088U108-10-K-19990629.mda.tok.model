item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading developer of health education content and software technologies  and since january  we have taken steps to become a leading provider of health  medical and wellness information online 
we have created  published and marketed multimedia software products  content and internet ready applications that provide anatomical  medical and health related information for the education  consumer and professional markets 
we have historically sold our products into the academic markets through alliances with distributors and by direct sales and marketing activities  but since march  we decided to concentrate sales efforts exclusively by indirect distribution methods 
during the final quarter of fiscal  we began investment and focus on an initiative to create the web site for the purpose of providing the public with health  medical and wellness information 
we immediately began expansion of our production  engineering  administrative  marketing and management teams in order to launch our web site  which debuted on may  during the final six months of fiscal  we formed strategic affiliate relationships with internet portals  other web sites  and traditional media outlets for the purpose of achieving broader exposure of the adam 
com brand 
we believe these relationships are a cost effective method of acquiring and distributing healthcare content  and ultimately as a means of driving high volumes of traffic to www 
adam 
com 
we expect to earn advertising and licensing revenues from advertisers  merchants  manufacturers and healthcare organizations who desire to reach a highly targeted community of healthcare consumers on the internet 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time of shipment to customers  distributors and resellers or  in the case of consignment arrangements  at the time of shipment from the consignee to their customers 
revenues from royalty agreements are recognized as earned based upon performance or product shipments 
licensing revenue is recognized when we have determined that contracts are finalized in cases where no further performance by us is required or over the term of the contract in cases where further performance by us is required  there are no significant return or acceptance provisions  and fees from the arrangement are fixed and determinable 
we record allowances for product returns based on historical experience and anticipated returns 
payments received in advance of shipments are recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and are recognized as revenue when the related software is shipped and all applicable obligations are fulfilled 
average net revenue for the  units of software sold in fiscal increased to approximately per unit compared with approximately per unit for  units sold in fiscal and per unit for  units sold for the fiscal year ending march  this was a result  in large part  of reduced unit sales of our lower priced consumer products in fiscal and unit shipments of lower priced  lower margin consumer products were approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
approximately of revenues in fiscal were derived from actual product shipments  compared to in fiscal primarily due to revenue of  from a single  one time licensing agreement recorded as international market revenue during fiscal during fiscal   was recognized from sales of education market products to awl and royalty revenue from sales by benjamin cummings a subsidiary of addison wesley of co developed education market products  and  was recognized from sales of consumer and education market products to mindscape  inc we expect future sales of our cd rom products to decrease significantly as we focus on our internet strategies 
we have experienced substantial losses since inception except for a small profit during fiscal  resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of march  for the fiscal year ended march   we incurred a net loss of million as compared to net income of  for the fiscal year ended march   and a net loss for the fiscal year ended march  of approximately million 
we believe that revenue from sales of software products will continue to decrease as less costly or free content accessed through the internet becomes more widely available 
accordingly  we have and will continue to reduce efforts to sell software products through traditional distribution models 
however  we further believe that the internet represents a unique opportunity for us to leverage our content assets into an online consumer health information strategy by both licensing content assets to other internet based businesses and by driving consumers to its web site 
in january  we leased approximately  square feet of office space in san francisco  california to accommodate the expansion of our web site management and production teams 
in june  we leased another  square feet of space in san francisco 
we expect to consolidate both locations by leasing  square feet in san francisco location in september we remain headquartered in atlanta  georgia and we do not expect the need for additional capacity at that location as our major operations continue to expand in san francisco 
in march  we released substantially all of our atlanta based direct software sales team corresponding to the re focus and commitment to internet strategies  and recorded a restructuring charge of  related to severance costs 
at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards available for tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in years through future sale of shares by certain significant shareholders could create a substantial ownership change as defined by the internal revenue service which would limit the amount of future taxable income that may be offset by pre ownership net operating loss carryforwards 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected financial data and the percentages of our net revenues represented by each line item and the percentage change in each line item 
fiscal year ended march  net revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing product development general and administration restructuring charge total costs and expenses operating income loss the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the revenues derived by us from product sales  license fees and royalty income in the academic  consumer and professional markets and from other sources 
other revenues include support services  such as training  and other non market specific sales 
we expect future revenues from the sales of products to these markets to decrease significantly as we focus on our internet strategies 
fiscal year ended march  education    professional consumer  other revenues net revenues    fiscal compared to fiscal total net revenues decreased  or  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a  one time  year international license agreement executed in fiscal  decreased consumer product revenues and decreased product sales in international markets  reflective of the downturned economic environments in overseas markets during fiscal in march  we ceased direct sales of product to the consumer market and outsourced distribution to mindscape 
total unit shipments of our cd rom products decreased to approximately  units in fiscal from approximately  units in fiscal  but average revenue per unit increased during this same period resulting from higher priced  education market cd rom products and decreased unit sales of lower priced consumer products 
net revenues from the education market decreased  or to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to the one time international license agreement in fiscal and decreased selling prices for products not offset by increases in units sold 
additionally  international unit product sales decreased  or to  from  in fiscal reflective of downturned economic markets abroad 
as a percent of total net revenues  net revenues from the education market remained steady at in fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues from the professional market decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue related to mli series products introduced during fiscal  which decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the revenue was derived from sales of custom services  license fees for software components developed by us  and product sales  each of which accounted for  and of total professional market net revenues  respectively  in fiscal  compared to  and in fiscal as a percent of total net revenues  net revenues from the professional market increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal net revenues from the consumer market decreased  or to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal due to reduced sales activity  insignificant consumer product marketing expenditures  and discontinued product upgrade for fiscal as a percent of total net revenues  net revenues from the consumer market decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of revenues increased  or  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal cost of revenues  which includes the cost of support  packaging  documentation  royalties and amortization of capitalized software development costs  increased almost exclusively due to amortization of capitalized software development costs which increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in amortization is primarily the result of reductions in previously recorded capitalized development costs in order to bring levels closer to expected future revenues to be generated  or net realizable value nrv 
reductions in net realizable value are the result of our decision not to support certain products moving forward and instead to focus on development and execution of our internet strategies 
as a percent of total net revenues  cost of revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the elimination of our direct sales force as a result of a more indirect distribution model at the end of fiscal did not significantly reduce costs for that year  and other staffing levels and costs remained consistent with fiscal levels 
as a percent of total net revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal resulting from the decrease in revenues described above 
product development costs increased  or  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in product development costs is primarily attributable to the shift in production activity to research and development of the web site  which is not subject to capitalization of development costs and our million grant from the national institute of science and technology nist 
as a percentage of total net revenues  product development expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal total expenditures for product development  including capitalized expenses  increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we capitalized product development expenses of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  which represented and of total expenditure for product development in these respective periods 
amortization of capitalized product development costs totaled  and  in fiscal and fiscal  and is included in cost of revenues described above 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of total net revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase was mainly due to increased legal  bad debt  investor relations  and compensation expenses 
net interest income decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to reduced average cash and short term securities balances during fiscal the lower balances during fiscal are the result of our net loss during fiscal and the repurchase of our common stock during both fiscal and fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal total net revenues increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a result of increased sales of our high end  flagship product in the education market  increased revenue from the professional market and increased licensing revenue 
total unit shipments of our products decreased to approximately  units in fiscal from approximately  units in fiscal the increased net revenues and decreased unit shipments reflect higher revenues per unit shipped  which are the result of higher pricing for our flagship product  aia  released in the first quarter of fiscal  distribution of lower priced consumer products such as adam the inside story and nine month miracle through a third party  and greater focus on sale of higher margin education products during fiscal net revenues from the education market increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to increased sales of the flagship education product  aia  as well as increased unit sales of other  more mature products such as the benjamin cummings interactive physiology series and app 
our agreement with kainos represented  of the education market net revenues 
in addition  in fiscal we recognized approximately  of revenue related to upgrade rights granted to purchasers of certain products that was deferred during fiscal as a percent of total net revenues  net revenues from the education market increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal net revenues from the consumer market decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal due primarily to the march distribution agreement with mindscape pursuant to which we receive royalties on the sale of consumer products rather than recognizing gross sales price as it had previously done 
as a percent of total net revenues  net revenues from the consumer market decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal net revenues from the professional market were  in fiscal these net revenues were derived from sales of custom services  license fees for software components developed by us  and product sales each of which accounted for   and of the total professional market net revenues  respectively 
approximately of product sales  or  into this market resulted from sales of medical legal series products introduced during fiscal as a percent of total net revenues  net revenues from the professional market were in fiscal cost of revenues decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal cost of revenues  which includes the cost of support  packaging  documentation  royalties and amortization of capitalized software development costs decreased primarily due to the significant reduction of consumer product units shipped as a result of the mindscape distribution agreement reached in march  partially offset by significant increases in royalty expenses related to increased sales of ip series products  increased capitalized software amortization and decreased software support costs 
as a percent of total net revenues  cost of revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal due to changes in product mix  specifically  the decreased unit sales of lower priced  lower margin consumer products  increased sales of the higher margin  higher priced flagship education product and the impact on net revenues from the recognition of income for certain education product sales that was deferred in fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased marketing activities related to the sale and distribution of our consumer market products as a result of the march mindscape distribution agreement 
sales and marketing costs attributable to sale and distribution of consumer products in fiscal totaled  and was insignificant for fiscal  accounting for nearly the entire reduction in overall sales and marketing costs for fiscal as a percentage of total net revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal product development costs decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to decreases in salary and consulting costs incurred in fiscal associated with the development of language lexicons for our international products and maintenance of the consumer product line in fiscal in addition  the amount of development costs capitalized for fiscal increased by  compared to fiscal  primarily resulting from earlier achievement of working models in the development process of products developed during fiscal as a percentage of total net revenues  product development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal total expenditures for product development  including capitalized expenses  decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we capitalized product development expenses of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  which represented and of total expenditure for product development in these respective periods

general and administrative expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of total net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease was mainly due to decreased legal  rent  bad debt  investor relations  and salary expenses 
rent and salary decreases in fiscal are the result of our restructuring in the second quarter of fiscal interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to reduced average cash and short term securities balances during fiscal the lower balances during fiscal are the result of our net loss during fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and working capital of  cash used in operating activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  principally as a result of net losses for fiscal and fiscal we use our working capital to finance ongoing operations  fund the development and introduction of new products and acquire capital equipment 
as of march   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock on the open market at an average price of approximately per common share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  repurchased shares represent approximately of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of march  our board of directors has authorized us to purchase up to of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
however  additional repurchases are not anticipated at this time 
we have experienced a substantial increase in our expenditures since the launch of our san francisco operation consistent with growth in operations and staffing  and we anticipate that this will continue for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate incurring additional expenses to increase our marketing and sales efforts  for content development and for technology and infrastructure development 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses  products and technologies  the expansion of our marketing and sales programs and more aggressive brand promotions 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through the end of fiscal we may raise additional funds  however  in order to fund more rapid expansion  to develop new and enhance existing services and products  to respond to competitive pressures and to possibly acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that any required additional financing will be available in terms favorable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest and these securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of the common stock 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt securities  we may be subject to certain limitations on its operations  including limitations on the payment of dividends 
if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully promote our brand name  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
our computer equipment and software and devices with imbedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities we have an initiative to ensure that computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the term computer equipment and software includes systems for product development  production and testing  accounting  data processing  telephone pbx  contact management  and other miscellaneous systems as well as other systems not traditionally thought of as computer related technologies such as fax machines  copiers  or other miscellaneous equipment and software 
these systems may contain imbedded technology  which complicate our year identification  assessment  remediation  and testing efforts 
based upon our identification and assessment efforts to date  we believe that mission critical systems either are currently  or are committed by our vendors to be year compliant 
we have not directly surveyed our vendors as to year compliance  but we plan to avail ourselves of any remedies developed by systems vendors and or publishers that address current year deficiencies  including currently known deficiencies or those discovered prior to year in addition  in the ordinary course of replacing computer equipment and software  we will attempt to obtain replacements that are year compliant 
by utilizing our internal resources to ongoingly assess  test  and remediate potential and discovered year issues  we believe that we are on schedule with the current initiative 
products we have developed have been internally tested for year compliance by our quality assurance team 
all internally developed products have been confirmed as year compliant  however  two products acquired by us from mosby  inc during fiscal are not year compliant 
we have decided not to remedy the two products  and are not actively promoting the sale of those products beyond fiscal through march   we have sold approximately  or  units of the non compliant products 
we estimate total exposure to remedy  which is limited to refunding customers their original purchase price  to be not greater than  we believe that the cost of our year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts will not exceed  which expenditures will be funded from existing cash balances 
such amount represents less than of the actual and anticipated information system equipment  software technology  and product production expenditures for fiscal and we estimate that we have spent approximately  as of march  on quality assurance testing of our products 
other non year product production and system technology efforts have not been materially delayed or impacted by the year initiative 
we presently believe that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for adam 
com 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially adversely impact our results of operation or adversely affect our relationships with customers  vendors or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse impact on our systems or results of operation 
we have not yet begun a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure by ourselves and certain third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
a contingency plan has not been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario and such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
we currently plan to complete such analysis and contingency planning by september  the costs of our year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts and the dates on which we believe we will complete such efforts are based upon our best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the availability of certain resources and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the ability to identify  assess  and remediate and test all relevant computer codes and embedded technology  and similar uncertainties 
in addition  variability of definitions of compliance with year and the myriad of different products and services  and combinations thereof  sold by adam 
com may lead to claims whose impact on adam 
com is not currently estimable 
no assurance can be given that the aggregate cost of defending and resolving such claims  if any  will not materially adversely affect the our results of operation 
although some of the our agreements and contracts with third parties contain provisions requiring such parties to indemnify us under some circumstances  there can be no assurance that such indemnification arrangements will cover all of our liabilities and costs related to claims by third parties related to the year issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million invested in liquid money market funds or bank accounts with average maturities of less than days 
the cash and cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk and we may receive higher or lower interest income if market interest rates increase or decrease 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by percent from levels at march  would not have a material impact on our cash or cash equivalents
