item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
b financial information about industry segments information with respect to this item may be found in note c description of business natural gas distribution eastern s natural gas distribution segment ldc segment is comprised of boston gas and essex gas  which together are engaged in the transportation and sale of natural gas to approximately  residential  commercial  and industrial customers in boston and other communities in eastern and central massachusetts 
the ldc segment also sells natural gas for resale in massachusetts and other states 
boston gas serves over  customers and is the largest natural gas distribution company in new england 
boston gas has been in business for years and is the second oldest gas company in the united states 
since  all of the common stock of boston gas has been owned by eastern 
as described above  essex gas was acquired by eastern in september essex gas serves approximately  customers 
for definitions of unfamiliar terms  see the glossary on page of the form k 
the ldc segment provides local transportation services and gas supply for all customer classes 
the ldc segment s services are available on a firm and non firm basis 
firm transportation services and sales are provided under rate tariffs and or contracts filed with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte  formerly the department of public utilities  that typically obligate the ldc segment to provide service without interruption throughout the year 
non firm transportation services and sales are generally provided to large commercial industrial customers who can use gas or another energy source interchangeably 
non firm services are provided through individually negotiated contracts and  in most cases  the price charged takes into account the price of the customer s alternative fuel 
k the ldc segment offers unbundled services to all commercial industrial users  who are allowed to purchase local transportation from the ldc segment separately from the purchase of gas supply  which the customer may buy from third party suppliers 
the ldc segment views these third party suppliers as partners in marketing gas and increasing throughput and expects to work closely with them to facilitate the unbundling process and ensure a smooth transition  especially in the tracking and processing of transactions 
the ldc segment has also implemented a program to educate commercial industrial customers about the opportunity to purchase gas from third party suppliers  while still relying on the utility for delivery 
as of december   the ldc segment had approximately  firm transportation customers 
the chart below reflects the migration of customers to transportation only service 
service to all residential customers currently is on a bundled basis 
while the migration of customers from bundled sales to transportation only service will lower the ldc segment s revenues  it has no impact on its operating earnings 
the ldc segment earns all of its margins on the local distribution of gas and none on the resale of the commodity itself 
bar chart firm throughput in bcf bundled transportation sales only bar chart boston area weather variance from normal markets and competition the ldc segment competes with other fuel distributors  particularly oil dealers  throughout its service territory 
gas throughput the following table provides information about the ldc segment s throughput during the three years  as measured in billions of cubic feet of natural gas at  btu per cubic foot bcf 
the reduction in throughput from to primarily reflects the warmer weather in  as shown in the chart above 
years ended december  residential commercial industrial off system sales total sales transportation of customer owned gas less off system sales total throughput firm throughput the table above excludes the cumulative effect of adopting the accrual method of revenue recognition  as discussed in note the one time effect of this change increased residential  commercial industrial and transportation throughput in by bcf  bcf and bcf  respectively 
residential customers comprise of the ldc segment s customer base  while commercial industrial establishments account for the remaining 
volumetrically  residential customers account for of total throughput and of firm throughput  while commercial industrial customers account for of total throughput and of firm throughput 
in  approximately of the commercial industrial customers total throughput was local transportation only service 
no customer  or group of customers under common control  accounted for more than of total firm revenues in firm throughput for boston edison accounted for of the total transportation of customer owned gas 
k gas supply the following table provides information about the ldc segment s sources of supply during in bcf years ended december  natural gas purchases lng purchases total purchases change in storage gas company use  unbilled and other 
total sales year to year variations in storage gas and unbilled gas reflect variations in end of year customer requirements  due principally to weather 
given the ready availability of supply during  the ldc segment purchased approximately two thirds of its peak pipeline supplies under short term and spot contracts 
the balance of peak day pipeline requirements is purchased directly from domestic and canadian producers and marketers pursuant to long term contracts which have been reviewed and approved by the dte or by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
pipeline supplies are transported on interstate pipeline systems to the ldc segment s service territory pursuant to long term contracts 
ferc approved tariffs provide for fixed demand charges for the firm capacity rights under these contracts 
the daily and annual capacity and the contract expiration dates of the interstate pipeline companies that provide firm transportation service to the ldc segment s service territory  are as follows capacity in bcf expiration pipeline daily annual dates algonquin gas transmission company algonquin tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee in addition  the ldc segment has firm capacity contracts on interstate pipelines upstream of the algonquin and tennessee pipelines to transport natural gas purchased by the ldc segment from producing regions to the algonquin and tennessee pipelines 
the expiration dates for these contracts are similar to those included in the above table 
the ldc segment has contracted with pipeline companies and others for the storage of natural gas in underground storage fields located in pennsylvania  new york  maryland and west virginia 
these contracts provide for storage capacity of bcf and peak day withdrawal capacity of bcf 
the ldc segment utilizes its existing capacity contracts to transport gas from the storage fields to its service territory 
supplemental supplies of lng and propane are purchased and produced from foreign and domestic sources 
peak day throughput was bcf  bcf  and bcf in   and  respectively 
the ldc segment provides for peak period demand through a least cost portfolio of pipeline  storage and supplemental supplies 
the ldc segment considers its annual and peak day sendout capacity  based on its total supply resources  to be adequate to meet the requirements of its firm customers 
regulation the ldc segment s operations are subject to massachusetts statutes applicable to regulated gas utilities 
rates  gas purchases  pipeline safety regulations  issuances of securities and affiliated party transactions are regulated by the dte 
rates for firm transportation and sales provided by the ldc segment are subject to approval by  and are on file with  the dte 
in addition  the ldc segment has a cost of gas adjustment clause cgac which allows for the adjustment of billing rates for firm gas sales to enable it to recover the actual cost of gas delivered to firm customers  including the demand charges for capacity on the interstate pipeline system and certain other charges 
boston gas rates for local transportation service are governed by a five year performance based rate plan approved by the dte in in its last rate proceeding in dpu under this plan  boston gas local transportation rates are recalculated annually to reflect inflation for the previous months  minus a productivity factor of percent 
the plan also provides for penalties if boston gas fails to meet specified service quality measures  with a maximum potential exposure of million 
rates are capped such that of earnings in k excess of a return on ending equity are to be passed back to ratepayers 
similarly  ratepayers would absorb of any shortfall below a return on ending equity 
the final year of the plan ends on october  boston gas has appealed the dte s order in dpu to the massachusetts supreme judicial court 
because of the low current rate of inflation  the calculation for resulted in a minor rate reduction of approximately  boston gas continues to recover its gas costs under its cgac 
essex gas rates for local transportation service are governed by a ten year rate plan approved by the dte in conjunction with its approval of eastern s acquisition of essex gas 
the plan immediately reduced rates for essex gas customers by reflecting expected gas supply cost savings passed back through the cgac 
the plan freezes base rates  which were set in a december rate order  through the freeze on base rates is subject to adjustment only to take into account certain exogenous factors  such as changes in tax laws  accounting changes  or regulatory  judicial or legislative changes 
all of essex gas administrative  operations and maintenance functions have been integrated with those of boston gas 
in july  the dte directed all ten investor owned gas distribution companies gas utilities in massachusetts to undertake a collaborative process with other stakeholders  including third party suppliers  customers and others  to develop common principles under which comprehensive gas service unbundling might proceed 
a settlement on model terms and conditions for unbundled transportation service jointly agreed upon by the gas utilities and the stakeholders was approved by the dte on november  further  on february   the dte ordered that for a five year transition period  massachusetts gas utility contractual commitments for upstream capacity will be assigned on a mandatory  pro rata basis to marketers selling gas to each gas utility s customers 
the mandatory assignment method assures that the costs of upstream capacity purchased by a gas utility to serve firm customers will not be absorbed as stranded costs by the gas utility or its remaining bundled customers during the five year transition period 
under the dte s order  during the transition period the gas utilities will retain primary responsibility for upstream capacity planning and procurement to support customer requirements and growth 
in year three of the transition period  the dte intends to evaluate the extent to which the upstream capacity market for massachusetts is workably competitive and shorten or lengthen the transition period accordingly 
while the dte s order assures the recoverability of stranded costs for capacity throughout the transition period  there can be no assurance about the recoverability of subsequent potential stranded costs until the dte has addressed the assignment of capacity after the transition period 
the restructuring collaborative is also examining how to extend unbundled transportation service to residential customers 
eastern was granted an exemption under the public utility holding company act of under section a thereof  pursuant to orders of the securities and exchange commission sec dated february   as amended by orders dated november  and august  eastern s exemption was confirmed pursuant to an order of the sec dated september   in conjunction with the essex gas acquisition 
seasonality and working capital the ldc segment s revenues  earnings and cash flows are highly seasonal as the demand for most of its distribution sales and servicess is for space heating and  therefore  is directly related to variations in temperature conditions 
the majority of the ldc segment s earnings is generated in the first quarter  with a seasonal loss occurring in the third quarter 
since the bulk of its revenues is billed in the november through april heating season  significant cash flows are generated from late winter to early summer 
in addition  while the ldc segment pays pipeline demand charges over the entire year  these charges are billed to customers over the heating season 
the lag between payment and billing of demand charges  along with other costs of gas distributed but unbilled  is reflected as deferred gas costs and is financed through short term borrowings 
short term borrowings are also required from time to time to finance normal business operations 
as a result of these factors  short term borrowings are generally highest during the late fall and early winter 
environmental matters the ldc segment may have or share responsibility under applicable environmental law for the remediation of certain former manufactured gas plant sites 
information with respect to environmental matters may be found in note such information is incorporated herein by reference 
employees as of december   the ldc segment had approximately  employees  of whom were organized in local unions 
all of the collective bargaining agreements expire in properties the ldc segment operates four lng facilities in dorchester  salem  lynn and haverhill  massachusetts 
these facilities enable the ldc segment to purchase  and at one facility to liquefy lng and store it for use in k periods of high demand 
the ldc segment owns and operates such facilities in dorchester and haverhill  massachusetts 
boston gas owns the real property beneath the salem and lynn facilities and rented those plants under a lease financing arrangement 
boston gas is currently litigating to enforce its purchase rights under the lease 
a stipulation with the lessor of the gas plants that allowed boston gas to operate these facilities expired october  boston gas remains in possession of the facilities pending the determination of its purchase rights on appeal 
on december   the ldc segment s distribution system included approximately  miles of gas mains   services and  active customer meters 
a majority of the gas mains consist of cast iron and bare steel pipe  which requires ongoing maintenance and replacement 
the ldc segment s mains and services generally are located on public ways or private property not owned by it 
the ldc segment s occupation of such property generally is pursuant to easements  licenses  permits or grants of location 
except as stated above  the principal items of property of the ldc segment are owned in fee 
in  the ldc segment s capital expenditures were million 
capital expenditures were principally made for system replacement  system expansion to meet customer demand and productivity enhancement initiatives 
the ldc segment plans to spend approximately million for similar purposes in  with a slightly higher proportion for system expansion

marine transportation the marine transportation segment is comprised of midland enterprises inc and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries together midland  which are engaged in the operation of a fleet of barges and towboats  principally on the ohio and mississippi rivers and their tributaries  the gulf intracoastal waterway and the gulf of mexico 
midland transports dry bulk commodities  a major portion of which is coal 
midland also operates a boat and barge repair facility  two coal dumping terminals  a phosphate rock and phosphate chemical fertilizer terminal and provides refueling and barge fleeting services 
sales midland transported million  million  and million tons in  and  respectively 
tonnage in grew from as a result of increased shipments by contract coal customers and new aggregate business acquired in  partly offset by lower grain and export coal demand 
tonnage in declined from  primarily as a result of the non renewal of several multi year contracts  unplanned plant outages for several customer accounts and lower demand from export coal and grain markets 
ton miles are the product of tons and distance transported 
the following charts depict tonnage by commodity and ton miles of cargo transported for the period pie chart tonnage by commodity coal grain other bar chart ton miles by commodity in millions coal grain other other includes sand  stone  gravel  iron  scrap  steel  coke  phosphate  other commodities and towing for others 
in  ton miles declined primarily due to an decline in the average length of haul  which resulted principally from lower coal and grain export tonnage 
in  ton miles declined due to the lower tonnage  as discussed above  partially offset by longer average hauls  particularly for coal 
in addition to changes in ton miles transported  midland s revenues and net earnings are affected by other factors such as competition  operating conditions and the segment of the river system traveled 
in and again in  river navigation was significantly affected by adverse weather conditions 
in  multiple tropical storms  flooding and lock delays affected operations  while record flooding  ice and lock repairs slowed production and reduced tonnage levels in  as described further in the competition section 
the following table summarizes midland s backlog of transportation and terminaling business under multi year contracts december  tons in millions revenues in millions portions of revenue backlog not expected to be filled within the current year the revenue backlog which is based on contracts that extend beyond december  is shown at prices in effect on december   which are generally subject to certain cost escalation de escalation provisions 
since services under many of the multi year contracts are based on customer requirements  midland has estimated its backlog based on its forecast of the anticipated requirements of these contract customers 
the increase in tonnage backlog from mainly reflects new multi year agreements  in addition to extended terms on current multi year contracts 
partially offsetting these increases are elapsing terms of current multi year contracts as they draw closer to maturity  including those excluded from the calculation as they enter their final k year 
the increase in revenue backlog exceeded the increase in the tonnage backlog due to the mix change of the forecasted backlog tonnage as longer haul commodities generally produce higher revenues on a tonnage basis 
electric utilities  which traditionally have entered into multi year transportation and coal supply agreements  have begun to shorten the term of some agreements for a variety of reasons such as clean air act requirements and increasing competitive pressures resulting from the ongoing deregulation of the electric power industry 
these factors have also led to changes in the sourcing of coal by utilities  leading to changes in traffic patterns 
the only significant raw material required by midland is the diesel fuel to operate its towboats 
diesel fuel is purchased from a variety of sources and midland regards the availability of diesel fuel as adequate for its operations 
seasonality revenues during winter months tend to be lower than revenues for the remainder of the year due to the freezing of some northern waterways  increased coal consumption by electric utilities during the summer months and the fall harvest of grain 
competition midland s marine transportation business competes on the basis of price  service and equipment quality and availability 
midland s primary competitors include other barge lines and railroads 
there are a number of companies offering transportation services on the waterways served by midland 
price competition between barge lines intensifies as barge supply exceeds demand 
during the past few years  barge supply has increased as the industry has built more barges than it has retired 
partially offsetting in were poor operating conditions and lock delays which consumed barge days and absorbed some of the additional capacity 
in addition  the strength of the us dollar and weak foreign economies reduced demand for us exports of coal and grain in and as a result of these factors and lower fuel costs in  market rates have fallen as competition has intensified 
in the revenues from an operating subsidiary of cinergy corp 
and the combined revenues from two operating subsidiaries of the southern company each accounted for more than of midland s consolidated revenues under multi year coal transportation agreements 
in a subsidiary of cinergy corp 
accounted for approximately of midland s consolidated revenues 
no other customer  or group of customers under common control  accounted for more than of revenues in  or on the basis of past experience and its competitive position  midland considers that the simultaneous loss of several of its largest customers  while possible  is unlikely to happen 
midland s multi year transportation and terminaling contracts expire at various dates from march through december during  approximately of midland s revenues resulted from multi year contracts 
a substantial portion of the contracts provide for rate adjustments based on changes in various costs  including diesel fuel costs  and  additionally  contain force majeure clauses that excuse performance by the parties to the contracts when performance is prevented by circumstances beyond their reasonable control 
many of these contracts also have provisions for termination for specified causes  such as material breach of contract  environmental restrictions on the burning of coal  or loss by the customer of an underlying commodity supply contract 
penalties for termination for such causes are not generally specified 
however  some contracts provide that in the event of an uncured material breach by midland that results in termination of the contract  midland would be responsible for reimbursing the customer for the differential between the contract price and the cost of substituted performance 
improvements in operating efficiencies have permitted barge operators to maintain comparatively low rate structures 
consequently  the barge industry has generally been able to retain its competitive position with alternate methods  primarily railroads  for the transportation of bulk commodities  particularly when the origin and destination of such movements are near or contiguous to navigable waterways 
towboats  such as those operated by midland  are capable of moving in one tow barge configuration approximately  tons of cargo equivalent to one hundred ton capacity railroad cars on the ohio river and upper mississippi river and approximately  tons equivalent to one hundred ton capacity railroad cars on the lower mississippi river  where there are no locks to transit 
barge transportation costs per ton mile are generally below those of railroads 
environmental matters midland is subject to the provisions of the federal water pollution control act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  the superfund amendment and reauthorization act  the resource conservation and recovery act of and the oil pollution act of which permit the coast guard and the environmental protection agency to assess penalties and clean up costs for k oil  hazardous substances  and hazardous waste discharges 
midland is further subject to comparable state environmental statutes in the states where it operates 
some of these acts also allow third parties to seek damages for losses caused by such discharges 
compliance with these acts has had no material effect on midland s capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position  and no such effect is currently anticipated 
properties as of december   midland s marine equipment consisted of  dry cargo barges and towboats 
approximately half of this equipment is either mortgaged to secure midland s equipment financing obligations or chartered under long term leases from third parties 
in  midland s capital expenditures were million 
these expenditures were made principally for the purchase of new barges and for renewal of equipment 
in midland expects to spend approximately million for capital equipment  primarily for the purchase of new barges 
employees as of december   midland employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately are represented by labor unions

growth in throughput was partially offsetting 
weather for calendar was warmer than normal and warmer than the revenue decrease associated with customer migration and lower gas costs has no impact on operating earnings as the ldc segment earns all of its margins on the local distribution of gas and none on the sale of the commodity or the passthrough of gas costs 
operating earnings in increased million  or  as lower operating costs million  throughput growth million  and modestly higher average rates were mostly offset by the negative impact of warmer weather million and higher depreciation expense 
the decrease in operating costs primarily reflects weather related reductions and continued cost control measures  as well as the absence of a million charge related to boston gas decision to exit the gas appliance service business in the operating earnings impact of this latter charge was essentially offset by the absence of the nonrecurring revenue increase related to the bad debt recovery mechanism  as described above 
the absence of a million gain in on the settlement of pension obligations was offset by the impact of conforming essex gas historical periods with those of eastern which increased operating earnings by million  reflecting the inclusion of essex gas operating earnings for december and the exclusion of its operating loss for september  as described in note marine transportation revenues in decreased million  or  reflecting lower ton mile production and lower rates resulting from weaker market conditions 
a strong us dollar and economic problems in asia combined to significantly reduce long haul export coal and grain demand  which in turn created excess barge capacity and placed downward pressure on rates 
tonnage transported in increased over  while ton miles declined due to shorter average trip lengths  primarily reflecting the reduced long haul export tonnage 
total coal tonnage increased with coal tonnage shipped under multi year contracts to utility customers increasing 
coal ton miles declined  however  due to the decline in long haul export coal shipments 
for the second straight year  extreme adverse weather conditions significantly increased operating costs and reduced productivity 
while experienced significant spring flooding on the ohio river  multiple tropical storms and hurricanes along the gulf coast continually disrupted intra coastal and nearby inland operations in in addition  the ohio river experienced extended periods of low water conditions  resulting in prolonged lock delays and mandated traffic restrictions 
these operating difficulties disrupted traffic patterns  lowered fleet productivity and materially increased operating expenses 
lower fuel prices  which dropped per gallon in  were partly offsetting 
reflecting these operating and market issues  operating earnings declined million  from k other services revenues of million include million from servicedge and million from amr data  which commenced operations in and  respectively 
their operating loss of million primarily reflects costs associated with starting these new businesses  principally servicedge 
other the million reduction in net interest expense reflects the use of short term investments to redeem million of midland debt in march  the issuance of million of effective rate debt by midland in september  and lower short term debt to finance the ldc segment s working capital requirements 
eastern recognized an extraordinary loss of million pre tax  million net  or

marine transportation total   the decrease in consolidated revenues from to primarily reflects decreased demand and lower rates at marine transportation and lower average usage and the migration of customers from firm gas sales to transportation only service  partially offset by sales to new customers  at natural gas distribution 
in millions change operating earnings natural gas distribution marine transportation headquarters total the decrease in operating earnings from to primarily reflects the impact of decreased revenues and poor operating conditions at marine transportation  partially offset by higher rates and lower operating expenses at the ldc segment 
natural gas distribution revenues in were about the same as in  primarily because lower average customer usage  the migration of customers from firm sales to transportation only service and the impact of comparatively warmer weather were offset by sales to new customers and the full year impact of boston gas rate increase 
weather for was colder than normal  but warmer than operating earnings increased million  or  from  primarily reflecting growth in throughput  lower operating expenses  higher rates and boston gas million gain on the settlement of pension obligations  partially offset by the margin impact of lower average usage and warmer weather 
boston gas recorded nonrecurring revenues of million related to a change  pursuant to its rate ruling  regarding the recovery mechanism for the portion of its bad debt expense associated with gas costs 
this income was largely offset by a charge of approximately million related to boston gas decision to exit the gas appliance service business 
k marine transportation revenues in decreased million or  primarily because of weak export demand for coal and grain  lower contractual requirements for utility and industrial coal and fewer barges 
weak demand depressed spot prices for nearly all commodities and traffic patterns were disrupted  reducing operational efficiency 
operating conditions in were worse than in and included record flooding on the ohio river  long traffic delays related to low water and repairs to various key locks throughout the river system  all of which resulted in higher operating costs and lower fleet productivity than in as a result of weaker markets  the fleet replacement program was slowed and expiring charters of outside barges were not renewed 
these decisions  in addition to delivery postponements due to production delays  reduced the size of midland s barge fleet 
tonnage and ton miles decreased and  respectively  reflecting the weak markets and operating conditions discussed previously 
a change in business mix and customer sourcing resulted in longer average hauls 
coal tonnage and ton miles decreased and  respectively  from the record levels of domestic coal volume  primarily for electric utilities  declined due to the nonrenewal of several multi year contracts  unplanned plant outages and milder temperatures 
export coal and grain demand weakened as the strong dollar made us supplies less competitive on the world market 
ongoing programs to lower vessel operating costs and administrative expenses partially offset the higher operating costs discussed above 
operating results at terminals were also lower  reflecting the reduced demand for coal transportation 
as a result of the adverse market and operational issues discussed above  operating earnings decreased by million  or  in other other income primarily reflects losses of million and million in and  respectively  representing eastern s share of a former joint venture s operating losses 
eastern s effective tax rate in was  which was lower than in  primarily because of adjustments related to prior year returns  as described in note year issues state of readiness eastern has assessed the impact of year issues with respect to its information technology it and embedded chip systems as well as the company s exposure to significant third party risks 
in this regard  eastern has initiated and completed substantial portions of its plans to replace or modify existing systems and technology and to assure that major customers and critical vendors are also addressing these issues 
with respect to its it systems  boston gas has tested and certified  as year ready  five of its eleven mission critical business systems

total risks of year issues natural gas distribution and marine transportation have assessed the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
given its efforts to minimize the risk of year failure by its internal systems and its distribution network control systems  the ldc segment believes its worst case scenario would involve failures by a pipeline supplier or by suppliers of telecommunications  electricity or banking services 
a short term interruption in pipeline supplies would require the utilization of locally stored liquefied natural gas supplies 
a telecommunications or electric outage would require the ldc segment to enact business contingency and disaster recovery measures to enable the continuation of service to its customers 
midland believes its worst case scenario would involve failures by the army corps of engineers  which operates the various lock and dam systems on the inland waterways  by rail services  which are essential for bringing commodities to the rivers for transit in barges  or by suppliers of telecommunications  electricity or banking services 
major delays to river traffic and customers could result in a loss of revenues 
such failures would require midland to enact disaster recovery plans  use alternate service providers and seek other routes of navigation  to the extent possible 
contingency plans the ldc segment has initiated the development of a business contingency plan concerning year risks to its internal systems  embedded chips and significant suppliers 
business processes are expected to be assessed and prioritized by march  detailed plans for critical business processes are expected to be developed and tested by september  midland is developing a contingency plan  which it expects to complete by june  to the extent midland believes that any supplier of critical goods or services poses a significant risk of year failure  it expects to locate backup providers by september  forward looking information this report and other company statements and statements issued or made from time to time contain certain forward looking statements concerning projected future financial performance  expected plans or future operations 
eastern cautions that actual results and developments may differ materially from such projections or expectations 
investors should be aware of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking projections or expectations 
these factors include  but are not limited to the effect of the colonial gas merger and other strategic initiatives on earnings and cash flow  eastern s ability to successfully integrate its new gas distribution operations  temperatures above or below normal in eastern massachusetts  changes in market conditions for barge transportation  adverse weather and operating conditions on the inland waterways  uncertainties regarding the profitability of servicedge  the timetable and cost for completion of eastern s year plans  the impact of third parties year issues  changes in economic conditions  including interest rates and the value of the dollar versus other currencies  regulatory and court decisions and developments with respect to eastern s previously disclosed environmental liabilities 
most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond eastern s control 
k liquidity and capital resources management believes that projected cash flow from operations  in combination with currently available resources  is more than sufficient to meet eastern s capital expenditure and working capital requirements  potential funding of its environmental liabilities  normal debt repayments  anticipated dividends to shareholders and the planned acquisition of colonial gas 
in addition to cash and marketable investments of million at december   eastern maintains million of borrowing capacity under long term revolving credit agreements  plus uncommitted lines  all of which are available for general corporate purposes 
at december   there were borrowings of million outstanding under these facilities 
to meet working capital requirements which reflect the seasonal nature of its business  natural gas distribution had outstanding million of short term borrowings at december   a decrease of million from the prior year  primarily reflecting lower balances for deferred gas costs 
in addition  natural gas distribution maintains bank credit agreements which support the issuance of up to million of gas inventory financing to fund its inventory of gas supplies 
at december   natural gas distribution had outstanding million of gas inventory financing for this purpose 
in march  midland utilized currently available cash and short term investments to redeem million of first preferred ship mortgage bonds  due in september  midland issued million of effective rate first preferred ship mortgage bonds due october   as discussed in note the million net proceeds of the notes will be used to fund current and future capital expenditures for barges and other equipment 
eastern s capital structure is depicted in the chart below 
subject to the effects of strategic initiatives which eastern might undertake  the company expects to continue its policy of capitalizing its ldc segment and midland with approximately equal amounts of equity and long term debt 
boston gas and midland currently maintain a ratings with the major rating agencies 
bar chart capital structure in millions debt equity total capital bar chart interest coverage natural gas marine transportation reported pre tax earnings plus depreciation  amortization and interest expense divided by interest expense 
consolidated capital expenditures for are budgeted at approximately million  with about at eastern s ldc segment and the balance at midland 
other matters eastern is aware of certain non utility sites  associated with former operations  for which it may have or share responsibility for environmental remediation or ongoing maintenance 
eastern has accrued a reserve of approximately million at december   to cover the remediation and maintenance costs of these sites  the principal of which is a former coal tar processing facility in everett  massachusetts  as described in note while eastern has provided reserves to cover the estimated probable costs of remediation and maintenance for environmental sites based on the information available at the present time  the extent of eastern s potential liability at such sites is not yet determined 
eastern s natural gas distribution operations  like many other companies in the natural gas industry  are parties to government proceedings requiring investigation and possible remediation of former manufactured gas plant mgp sites 
boston gas and essex gas may have or share responsibility under applicable environmental law for remediation of such sites  as described in note boston gas and essex gas are aware of other mgp sites within their service territories 
a subsidiary of new england electric system has provided full indemnification to boston gas with respect to eight of these sites 
at this time  there is substantial uncertainty as to whether boston gas or essex gas has or shares responsibility for remediating any of these other sites 
no notice of responsibility has been issued to boston gas or essex gas for any of these sites from any governmental authority
