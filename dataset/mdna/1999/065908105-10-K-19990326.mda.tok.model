the above items were partially offset by an increase in net interest income relating to the larger loan portfolio  income from real estate operations and a net pension curtailment gain 
included in the company s statement of operations for the year ended december  was a million net pension curtailment gain and a million restructuring charge 
the pension curtailment gain net resulted from the freezing of benefits relating to the company s defined benefit pension plan and the termination of employees at the end of the restructuring charges relating to continuing operations was for severance and benefits relating to full time employees that were terminated  write down of assets associated with facility closures  and liabilities established for lease contracts on closed branches 
included in the restructuring was the elimination of indirect consumer loan originations  the closing and merging of branches and the consolidation of mortgage banking operations in the tampa bay market into a centralized processing operation 
the primary reasons for the increase in income from continuing operations during compared to was an increase in net interest income resulting from the purchase of wholesale residential loans and the october acquisition of bna  increased noninterest income from trading securities gains  gains on sales of loans held for sale  and gains on sales of securities available for sale  and higher fee income from loans  deposits  and atm customers due to an expanded branch and atm network and a larger loan portfolio 
discontinued operations historically  the msb has been a positive source of income for the company by generating net fee income and by providing a substantial interest free source of funds from escrow balances  as well as periodic gains from servicing portfolio sales 
the rapidly changing interest rate environment during  coupled with competition and technological advances  produced a refinancing climate that had not been experienced in recent years and  as a result  caused significant volatility 
the effect of significant prepayments of loans underlying msrs and an increase in the anticipated rate of future prepayments resulted in the establishment at september  of a million valuation allowance for impairment of msrs 
no such allowance was required at the prior quarter end when anticipated prepayments were more comparable to recent historical rates 
the company determined in december to discontinue the msb 
included in the loss from discontinued operations during the year ended december  was a million provision for the disposal of the msb net of income taxes 
the remaining loss from discontinued operations during primarily resulted from rapidly declining interest rates during causing prepayments and declines in the value of the msr asset 
the increase in income from discontinued operations during the year ended december  compared to the period resulted from higher gains on the sale of msrs

the provision for loan losses increased in each of the years in the three years ended december  the higher provision for loan losses during the year ended december  compared to resulted from consumer loan charge offs primarily from the indirect consumer lending portfolio  charge offs from small business loans which the company began originating during the fourth quarter  charge offs from lti lease financing operations which was acquired in march  charge offs in commercial business loans relating to the company s factoring operations  and a significant increase in the allowance for loan losses reflecting recent growth in small business lending and indirect consumer and small business delinquency trends 
since the company has made a number of attempts to profitably enter the indirect consumer loan market 
from to the majority of indirect loans generated were home improvement and automobile loans 
purchases of home improvement loans ceased in and indirect automobile lending ceased in in connection with the acquisition of megabank in and the acquisition of bna in  bankatlantic again commenced offering indirect consumer loans  primarily automobile loans 
throughout the to period delinquencies and charge offs of indirect automobile loans continued to increase in either absolute dollars or as a percentage of the portfolio  particularly in the latter part of these trends resulted in a further increase in losses associated with indirect consumer loans 
the increased allowance for consumer loans reflects the fact that charge offs were higher than for even though the average balance of loans declined in although there have been numerous management and system changes for this product  the number of delinquencies  charge offs and yields of this product resulted in management s decision at the end of to again cease  acquiring indirect consumer loans 
during the latter part of  bankatlantic began originating small business loans 
initial allowances were based upon industry information and internal experience with similar products 
as the program progressed  delinquencies and charge offs increased  particularly in the fourth quarter of in response to these trends  the allowance for loan losses was increased 
personnel and operating changes have been and are continuing to be made  including the use of more restrictive underwriting standards 
the acquisition of lti in also resulted in an increase in the allowance for the year due to the expansion of lti s activities and the establishment of an allowance based upon charge offs experienced after acquisition which were higher than those historically experienced by lti 
a significant factor used by bankatlantic in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is historical loan loss experience with greater emphasis placed on current trends in delinquencies and charge offs 
determinations may also be impacted by geographic and personnel factors 
the company also terminated its factoring operations in mid since the credit quality and yields associated with the product were not consistent with the company s goals 
the provision for loan losses increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period due to charge offs in the indirect consumer loan portfolio  an increase in specific reserves primarily related to a real estate construction loan acquired in connection with the bna acquisition  and higher aggregate loan balances and delinquency trends in the net commercial business loan charge offs primarily reflect charge offs of unsecured loans acquired in connection with the bna and megabank acquisitions

the increase in nonaccrual loans reflected two commercial nonresidential real estate nonaccrual loans totaling million  nonaccrual lease financing contracts from lti  and nonaccrual small business loans

the decline in consumer nonaccrual balances reflected a reduction in home equity nonaccrual loans from december repossessed assets declined at december  compared to december  the decline reflected lower residential and commercial real estate owned and automobile repossessed assets  partially offset by lease finance repossessions 
the decline in restructured loans reflected the reclassification from non performing to performing status of two loans that performed based on the terms of their agreements

the increase in nonaccrual residential loans was primarily due to higher residential loan balances in compared to non accrual consumer loans increased at december  compared to due to increased direct consumer loan nonaccrual balances and higher indirect nonaccrual consumer loans acquired in connection with the bna and megabank acquisitions 
the nonaccrual direct consumer loans were primarily home equity loans  and the nonaccrual indirect loans were primarily automobile loans

all employees were vested based on their years of service 
employees will not receive any further credit for future services  while the plan is frozen 
the freezing of the plan and the termination of employees resulted in a net pension curtailment gain at december  other non interest expense increased for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the increased other non interest expenses during the year ended december  compared to reflect the expanded atm network  the expanded branch network  and the increased number of departments and personnel

such increase was partially offset in by depreciation and amortization expense increasing significantly during compared to and due to accelerated premium amortization on the wholesale residential loan portfolio which was caused by increased actual and anticipated prepayments due to the declining interest rate environment

asset and liability management bankatlantic originates commercial real estate loans  commercial business loans  small business loans  and consumer loans which generally have higher yields and shorter durations than residential real estate loans 
bankatlantic originates residential loans with both fixed and adjustable rates  however the majority of residential loans originated are currently sold to correspondents 
bankatlantic also purchases residential loans with both fixed and adjustable rates  which are retained for portfolio 
since these bulk loan purchases are acquired periodically  management believes it is in a better position unlike the case of individual loan originations to manage the interest rate risk in this portfolio due to the size and generally homogeneous nature of these purchases 
bankatlantic also acquires mortgage backed securities and treasury securities with intermediate terms 
during recent years in order to lower its cost of funds  bankatlantic has not emphasized certificates of deposit and seeks to generate low cost transaction accounts as market opportunities allow 
see mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
in managing its asset and liabilities  management continually assesses general economic conditions  the interest rate environment  and the yields and credit risk associated with alternative investments 
market risk market risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market valuation which arise from interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and equity price risk 
the company s primary market risk is interest rate risk and its secondary market risk is equity price risk 
equity price risk the company including rbco maintains a portfolio of trading and available for sale securities which subjects the company to equity pricing risks 
the change in fair values of equity securities represents instantaneous changes in all equity prices segregated by trading  securities sold not yet purchased and available for sale securities 
the following are hypothetical changes in the fair value of the company s trading and available for sale securities at december  based on percentage changes in fair value 
actual future price appreciation or depreciation may be different from the changes identified in the table below 
total available securities dollar percent trading for sale sold not change change in securities securities yet from fair value fair value fair value purchased dollars in thousands during  the company began trading government securities which are generally bought and sold on the same day 
in addition  rbco is a market maker in equity securities which could  from time to time require them to hold securities during declining markets 
the company attempts to manage its equity price risk by maintaining a relatively small portfolio of securities and evaluating equity securities as part of the company s overall asset and liability management process 
the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature subjecting the company to significant interest rate risk 
the company has developed a model using vendor software to quantify its interest rate risk 
a sensitivity analysis was performed measuring the company s potential gains and losses in net portfolio fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments at december  resulting from a change in interest rates 
interest rate sensitive instruments included in the model were the company s bullet loan portfolio  bullet debt securities available for sale  bullet investment securities  bullet fhlb stock  bullet federal funds sold  bullet deposits  bullet advances from fhlb  bullet securities sold under agreements to repurchase  bullet federal funds purchased  bullet subordinated debentures  bullet trust preferred securities  and bullet off balance sheet loan commitments 
the company has no off balance sheet derivatives other than fixed rate loan commitments aggregating million at december  the model calculates the net potential gains and losses in net portfolio fair value by i discounting anticipated cash flows from existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts at market rates to determine fair values at december   ii discounting the above expected cash flows based on instantaneous and parallel shifts in the yield curve to determine fair values  iii the difference between the fair value calculated in i and ii is the potential gains and losses in net portfolio fair values 
management has made estimates of fair value discount rates that it believes to be reasonable 
however  because there is no quoted market for many of these financial instruments  management has no basis to determine whether the fair value presented would be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale 
bankatlantic s fair value estimates do not consider the tax effect that would be associated with the disposition of the assets or liabilities at their fair value estimates 
the prepayment assumptions used in the model are disclosed in bankatlantic s cumulative rate sensitivity gap at december  subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities were valued for this purpose based on their contractual maturities or redemption date 
the company s interest rate risk policy has been approved by the board of directors and establishes guidelines for tolerance levels for net portfolio value changes based on interest rate volatility 
management has maintained the portfolio within these established tolerances 
presented below is an analysis of the company s interest rate risk at december  as calculated utilizing the company s model 
the table measures changes in net portfolio value for instantaneous and parallel shifts in the yield curve in basis point increments up or down 
net portfolio changes value dollar in rate amount change dollars in thousands bp   bp   bp  bp   bp   certain assumptions by the company in assessing the interest rate risk were utilized in preparing the preceding table 
these assumptions related to bullet interest rates  bullet loan prepayment rates  bullet deposit decay rates  bullet market values of certain assets under various interest rate scenarios  and 
bullet repricing of certain borrowings it was also assumed that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates although there can be no assurance that this would be the case 
even if interest rates change in the designated increments  there can be no assurance that the company s assets and liabilities would perform as indicated in the table above 
in addition  a change in us treasury rates in the designated amounts  accompanied by a change in the shape of the yield curve could cause significantly different changes to the fair values than indicated above 
furthermore  the result of the calculations in the preceding table are subject to significant deviations based upon actual future events  including anticipatory and reactive measures which the company may take in the future 
interest rate sensitivity bankatlantic s profitability is dependent to a large extent on its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on its interest earning assets such as loans and its interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities such as deposits 
like most financial institutions  changes in general interest rate levels and other economic factors affect bankatlantic s profitability 
if there is a mismatch between the dollar amount of repricing or maturing assets such as loans and liabilities such as time deposits  a financial institution is said to have an interest rate sensitivity gap 
a financial institution s interest rate risk arises from an interest rate sensitivity gap 
financial institutions measure this interest rate risk in terms of the ratio of the interest rate sensitivity gap to the institution s total assets 
if more assets reprice or mature over a given time frame than liabilities  the financial institution is considered asset sensitive 
this risk is reflected as a positive gap 
conversely  if more liabilities reprice or mature over a given time frame than assets  the financial institution will be considered liability sensitive 
this risk is reflected as a negative gap 
an asset sensitive position ie  a positive gap will generally enhance earnings in a rising interest rate environment because more interest earning assets will be repriced or replaced at higher interest rates than interest paying liabilities 
in a falling interest environment an asset sensitive position will generally negatively impact earnings since more interest earning assets will be repriced or replaced at lower interest rates than interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  a liability sensitive position ie  a negative gap will generally enhance earnings in a falling interest rate environment more interest bearing liabilities are replaced or repriced at lower rates than interest earning assets and negatively impact earnings in a rising interest rate environment more interest bearing liabilities will be replaced or repriced at higher rates than interest earning assets 
at december   bankatlantic had a one year positive cumulative gap of 
this positive one year gap position may  as noted above  have a negative impact on bankatlantic s earnings in a declining interest rate environment 
however  it is important to note that the company makes a number of assumptions to calculate its interest rate sensitivity gap 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates and the assumptions may not prove to be correct 
accordingly  the company s interest rate sensitivity gap may not accurately reflect the impact of changes in interest rates on the company s profitability 
in addition  management of bankatlantic may take anticipatory or reactive measures in response to changes in interest rates that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity calculation 
while bankatlantic has attempted to structure its asset and liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net interest income of changes in market interest rates  there is no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
adverse impact of accelerated prepayments on net interest income generally  as interest rates fall  loan prepayments accelerate 
due in significant part to current historically lowinterest rates  bankatlantic has experienced a high volume of loan prepayments in its mortgage portfolio and in its servicing portfolio during the year ended december  those prepayments adversely affected its results of operations during this period 
bankatlantic completely amortizes the remaining msrs upon prepayment of the associated loan 
the yields earned with respect to the portion of bankatlantic s mortgage portfolio which were prepaid were greater than alternative short term investments in which bankatlantic reinvested such funds  also adversely impacting the results of operations for the period 
significant loan prepayments in bankatlantic s mortgage portfolio and msr portfolio in the future could have a similar adverse effect on results of operations 
prepayments of the underlying loans also may have an adverse effect on bankatlantic s ability to sell msrs at the value estimated at december  additionally  increased prepayments associated with purchased residential loans may result in increased amortization of premiums on acquired loans  which would reduce interest income 
at december   bankatlantic serviced approximately  loans with outstanding principal balances serviced of billion representing net msrs of million 
see the discussion below relating to the company s decision to exit the msb 
adverse impact of accelerated prepayments on valuation of financial instruments changes in general interest rate levels also affect the valuation of the company s assets and liabilities  including msrs  that are interest rate sensitive 
the company may be required under generally accepted accounting principles to establish a valuation allowance to reflect a decline in the market value of its assets as a result of changes in interest rates 
for the year ended december   bankatlantic established a valuation allowance of million million at september  to reflect the decline in the market value of its msrs primarily as a result of historically low interest rate levels causing anticipated acceleration of prepayments of the loans associated with the msrs 
while the company intends to exit the msb the company s results of operations would be adversely affected in future periods if changes in interest rates adversely impact the market value of its assets and liabilities

liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of cash flow is dividends from bankatlantic 
the company also obtains funds upon the exercise of outstanding stock options to acquire its stock and  as previously noted  through the sale of common shares and issuance of debt securities 
the company s annual debt service associated with its million of   and debentures and its trust preferred securities is approximately million 
the company s estimated current annual dividends to common shareholders is million 
during  the company received million of dividends from bankatlantic 
liquidity relates to bankatlantic s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet funding needs to support loan demand  to meet deposit withdrawals and to pay operating expenses 
bankatlantic s securities portfolio provides an internal source of liquidity as a consequence of its short term investments as well as scheduled maturities and interest payments 
loan repayments and sales also provide an internal source of liquidity 
deposits have been the principal source of bankatlantic s funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes  however  loan repayments  sales of securities  capital contributions from the company  advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of atlanta and other borrowings  and the use of repurchase agreements have been additional sources of funds 
loan principal prepayments and deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates 
borrowings may be used by bankatlantic on a short to intermediate term basis to compensate for reductions in normal sources of funds such as savings inflows  and to provide additional liquidity investments 
on a long term basis  borrowings may support expanded lending activities and purchases of loans and investments 
bankatlantic has borrowed primarily from the fhlb of atlanta and through the use of repurchase agreements and in  brokered deposits 
the company and bankatlantic currently engage in real estate development and investment activities through the ownership of slwhc and equity investments in real estate limited partnerships and there is significant volatility in the timing of real estate sales 
there is no assurance that periodic sales of properties from slwhc or the real estate investments will be sufficient to fund operating expenses in future years 
slwhc had approximately million in operating expenses during to the extent real estate sales are not adequate to cover operating expenses  it may be necessary to fund the operating deficit

any partial or total disposition would be subject to regulatory approval and the structure of the transaction could also be impacted by income tax considerations 
as of december   the company s investment in bdc amounted to million and included slw and six joint ventures 
such investment is currently excluded for purposes of calculation of bankatlantic s regulatory capital compliance 
the impact to the company of any type of disposition of bdc is dependent upon the consideration to be received by the company for such disposition 
any form of disposition which results in consideration to the company or bankatlantic at less than the value of its investment in bdc could negatively impact the company and bankatlantic s financial condition and results of operations 
however  as discussed elsewhere herein  there are significant risks associated with real estate development activities and there is no assurance that the company s continued involvement in these activities will positively contribute to the company s or bankatlantic s financial condition or results of operations

subject portfolio from through  bankatlantic purchased in excess of million of indirect homeimprovement loans from certain dealers  primarily in the northeastern united states 
bankatlantic ceased purchasing loans from such dealers in the latter part of these dealers were affiliated with each other but were not affiliated with bankatlantic 
in connection with loans originated through these dealers  bankatlantic funded amounts to the dealers as a dealer reserve 
such loans and related dealer reserves are referred to herein as the subject portfolio 
in late  questions arose relating to this portfolio and such questions revolved around practices which were intended to defraud bankatlantic 
as a consequence of this activity bankatlantic filed a claim with its insurance carrier which resulted in payments of million by the carrier to bankatlantic during through the carrier has no obligation to make further payments on this matter to bankatlantic 
as part of the settlement agreement with the carrier covenant  bankatlantic agreed to and did file suit against certain third parties 
the covenant provides that in the event of recovery by bankatlantic of damages against third party wrongdoers  bankatlantic will be entitled to retain such amount until such amounts plus any payments received from national union equal million plus the costs incurred by bankatlantic to obtain such recoveries 
a trial against various wrongdoers was held in february and judgment was entered in favor of bankatlantic and the carrier against over fifty third party defendants  individuals and corporations 
a number of these third party defendants have been convicted of criminal fraud 
additionally  bankatlantic has been named as a defendant in various litigation instituted by or for the benefit of various consumers who were mortgagors of the loans 
at december   all such litigation had been resolved except for the ongoing action in new jersey  discussed below 
two actions were filed in new jersey 
one of the new jersey actions was brought on behalf of the state of new jersey and was resolved in the remaining new jersey action  which was brought against over parties  including bankatlantic  purported to be a class action on behalf of named and unnamed plaintiffs that may have obtained loans from dealers who subsequently sold the loans to financial institutions  including bankatlantic

dividends the company intends to pay regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock 
funds for dividend payments and interest expense on the   debentures and trust preferred securities are or will be dependent upon bankatlantic s ability to pay dividends to the company 
current regulations applicable to the payment of cash dividends by savings institutions impose limits on capital distributions based on an institution s regulatory capital levels and net income 
see regulation and supervision restriction on dividends and other capital distributions 
subject to the results of operations and regulatory capital requirements for bankatlantic  the company will seek to declare regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock 
the company has previously effected stock splits in the form of a stock dividend of class a common stock to both class a and class b common shareholders 
due to accounting and tax considerations  adjustment for such stock dividends to class b common stock options previously granted under the company s option plans are made only in class b common stock 
year considerations many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the consequences of incomplete or untimely resolution of year issues represent an uncertainty that could affect future financial results 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that computer applications will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company has established a year action plan which was presented to the board of directors on december  the action plan was developed using the guidelines outlined in the federal financial institutions examination council s the effect of on computer systems 
the six phases of the company s action plan are awareness define the year issues  gain executive level support  establish a project team and develop a strategy which encompasses technology and business issues  assessment assess the size and complexity of the issues and detail the magnitude of the effort necessary to address them  renovation code enhancements  hardware and software upgrades  and system replacements  validation testing of software  system components and connections between systems  implementation systems should be certified as year ready by the business users  and contingency planning determination of strategy to handle the most likely worst case scenarios on year issues 
the company believes that it has completed the awareness and assessment phases of its action plan 
renovation  validation and implementation phases were approximately completed at december  with anticipated and completion as of march  and june   respectively 
the contingency planning phase was completed as of december   and is scheduled to be complete as of march  and completed as of june  although the company expects to meet its action plan schedule  there is no assurance that this timetable will be completed according to schedule 
the majority of the company s mission critical information technology system structure it has been outsourced to third party vendors 
the company s internal it primarily consists of a minicomputer for item processing and a personal computer based wide area network 
the wide area network s primary function is to communicate with third party service bureaus and secondarily to run non critical personal computer applications such as e mail  word processing and spreadsheet programs 
the company has various non it systems with embedded microcontrollers  including but not limited to  vault security equipment  branch security equipment  telephone systems  circuit boards on building equipment  building elevators  and appliances 
the above it and non it systems could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company relies on third party vendors to perform loan  deposit  general ledger and other application processing 
the company is monitoring the progress of these third party vendors in meeting their year obligations and is actively involved in the implementation and testing of the modified application programs 
the third party vendors completed the update of the application programs during the fourth quarter of with the company testing the programs during the first quarter of although the company currently has no indication that its third party vendors will not be able to operate as a result of year related problems  there is no assurance that these third party vendors will meet their obligations to the company 
included in the statement of operations during the year ended december  were  of third party expenses related to the year action plan 
the company estimates that it will spend approximately  on year consulting services   on software and hardware maintenance specifically related to year   on rbco system upgrades and consulting services and  for contingency planning during the year ended december  the above items will be expensed as incurred and do not include employee compensation allocated for time spent on the year project 
risk factors associated with the year event include the risk that the company s business could be disrupted due to vendors  suppliers  and customer system failures  or even the possible loss of electrical power or phone service 
the company is currently assessing the probability of these events occurring and is formulating contingency plans 
the company could be also subjected to litigation due to year noncompliance from customers  borrowers and suppliers as a result of both internal and third party system failures 
the company as part of its action plan has sent brochures to customers  and questionnaires to borrowers and suppliers  and as mentioned above is addressing both it and non it year issues 
further  the credit quality of the company s loans may be affected by the failure of a borrower s operating or other systems as a consequence of a year issue or the related failure of a borrower s key suppliers  customers  or service providers resulting in higher provisions for loan losses 
the company s underwriting and credit policies include consideration of a borrower s potential year issues 
there is no assurance that the company s borrowers will be able to meet their obligations to the company if these borrowers experience year problems 
certain assets of the company may have to be replaced  based on upgrades to equipment and software that are part of the company s normal business needs  rapidly developing technology  and a three year capital equipment and software replacement plan 
the company does not anticipate impairment or significant replacement of assets related to the year issue 
there is no assurance that the foregoing has identified all costs  risks or possible losses which the company may experience associated with year issues 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers  borrowers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the goal of the year project is to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
impact of inflation the financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of bankatlantic are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on bankatlantic s performance than the effects of general price levels 
although interest rates generally move in the same direction as inflation  the magnitude of such changes varies 
the possible effect of fluctuating interest rates is discussed more fully under the previous section entitled interest rate sensitivity
