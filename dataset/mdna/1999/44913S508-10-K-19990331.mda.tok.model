part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations for compared to total revenue increased in to million from million in our hyperfeed and lan services and internet services both posted increases in over hyperfeed and lan service revenue increased  or  from million in to million in revenue growth was experienced through increased service offerings 
revenue from our internet services increased million  or  to million in from million in the growth is principally due to our pc quote internet service where the number of subscribers grew from  at the end of to  at the end of direct costs of services increased approximately to million in from million in principal components of the increase were royalties  leased equipment  communication costs  and compensation directly attributable to internet services and pc quote subscriber growth  and payments to providers of market data 
amortization of software development costs decreased from million in to million in due to certain projects not planned for release until direct costs associated with hyperfeed and lan services increased from million in to million in increases in license and exchange fees and the cost of customer support were offset to a degree by efficiencies in data feed operations and a decrease in amortization of software development costs 
the resulting gross margin increased slightly to million in from million in direct costs associated with internet services increased to million from million in the significant growth we experienced caused us to incur increases in license and exchange fees  customer support and operations devoted to these services 
software amortization also increased as more resources were diverted to this portion of our business 
the gross margin on internet services increased from  in to million in  as we were able to leverage our infrastructure and support operations 
total operating expenses declined  or  as a result of the restructuring in and subsequent cost containment efforts 
decreases from restructuring charges and in general and administrative expenses were offset to a degree by increases in sales expense and product and market development 
sales costs increased to million in as compared to million in the increase was due to additional sales personnel added at the end of and early  increased advertising expenditures and higher total commission expense as a result of increased sales of our pc quote internet service offering 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was principally due to reductions in compensation and related employee costs  lower utilization of consultants and external professionals and a decrease in bad debt expense as compared to the prior year 
product and market development costs increased to million in from million in the increase was due to an increase in the number of personnel devoted to these efforts  in addition to costs of maintaining and enhancing previously developed products and services 
depreciation and amortization remained unchanged at million year to year 
there were no restructuring charges recognized in like the million reported for interest expense was million for  a decrease of from the million recognized in the decrease reflects the absence of non cash amortization of  recognized in for the value of common stock purchase warrants that were issued to pico holdings  inc this was offset by an increase in interest expense amortization to  in from  in for the value of the million convertible subordinated debenture s beneficial conversion feature 
also included is interest on our bank term loan  the convertible subordinated debenture and borrowings from pico holdings  inc see note and note of the notes to financial statements 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations for compared to  continued in december we converted current debt into convertible preferred stock 
the maximum conversion rates for the two series of preferred issued were set at and above the closing market price of our common at the time the conversion was approved by our board in september stockholder approval  obtained in december  was a condition to closing the debt conversion transactions 
the market price of our common stock on the closing date was slightly higher than the maximum conversion price agreed to in september 
accounting and sec pronouncements require this differential to be treated as non cash preferred dividends 
preferred dividends of  were recognized in with a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital from the preferred issuance 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
results of operations for compared to total revenue increased in to million from million in the increase is despite the loss of two major customers that used our traditional direct data feed service 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
the lost revenue from the two customers  million  was offset by an increase of approximately  in net new data feed service revenue and a million increase in our internet services revenue 
our internet services  launched in  grew from  in to million in  a increase 
the increase reflects professional and individual investors acceptance of the internet as a medium for receiving delayed and real time market data 
direct costs of services increased to million in from million in principal components of the increase were royalties  leased equipment  communication costs  and compensation directly attributable to internet operations and sales of pc quote  and payments to providers of market data 
amortization of software development costs increased to million in from million in the increase is the result of our continued investment in our internet and direct data feed services and delivery mechanisms 
also contributing to the increase was our determination that our software projects should be amortized over a three year period 
we also assessed the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for software projects capitalized in earlier years with a five year amortization period 
based on our assessment  no adjustment to their net realizable value was necessary 
direct costs associated with hyperfeed and lan services increased from million in to million in increases in license and exchange fees and amortization of software development costs were offset to a degree by decreases in the cost of customer support and data feed operations related to the two lost customers 
principally due to the lost customers  the resulting gross margin decreased significantly from million in to million in direct costs associated with internet services increased to million from million in the significant growth we experienced caused us to incur increases in license and exchange fees  customer support and operations devoted to these services 
software amortization also increased as more resources were employed to develop this portion of our business 
the resulting gross margin increased from a negative  to a positive  total operating expenses increased million  or  as a result of the restructuring in and increases in sales  general and administrative  and product and market development incurred to improve operations and generate replacement revenue growth 
sales costs increased to million in as compared to million in the increase was mainly due to higher commission incentives and increased sales of our pc quote internet service offering 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the increase was principally due to higher utilization of consultants and external professionals as compared to the prior year 
the higher utilization resulted from financing alternatives pursued by us during  in addition to professionals employed by us to assist in improving our operations 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations for compared to  continued product and market development costs increased to million in from million in we incurred additional personnel and related costs in in order to develop  market and brand our internet service offerings 
depreciation and amortization was unchanged at million for and we had a significant management reorganization and restructuring of operations in june we wrote off approximately  of unamortized software development costs related to previously capitalized software projects that were discontinued 
the management reorganization resulted in employment related termination costs of  we also paid  to terminate a contractual arrangement related to unprofitable operations 
as a result  we recognized restructuring expense of million 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
interest expense was million for  an increase of  over the  incurred in the increase reflects the recognition of non cash amortization of  for the value of the million convertible subordinated debenture s beneficial conversion feature  and amortization of  for the value of the common stock purchase warrants issued to pico holdings  inc in connection with a financing arrangement 
also included is interest on the bank term loan  the convertible subordinated debenture and financing arrangement borrowings 
see note and note of the notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources net cash and cash equivalents were essentially unchanged at million at the end of and expenditures for new equipment were less in versus as a result of lower prices for computer equipment and increased efficiencies implemented in our operations 
capitalized software costs were higher in than due to an increase in development resources devoted to coding  testing and quality assurance of new service offerings 
in december we converted million of current debt into preferred equity 
the converted debt was comprised of  convertible subordinated debenture principal balance  accrued interest on the convertible subordinated debenture in the amount of   including  borrowed in  principal balance on the loan facility with pico holdings  inc   facility fee on the loan facility  and accrued interest on loan facility borrowings in the amount of  we incurred approximately  in legal and associated costs to affect the debt conversion 
interest expense related to the converted debt accounted for approximately million of the loss reported for in january we completed a rights offering receiving approximately million in gross proceeds from the sale of shares underlying exercised rights 
the entire proceeds were used to fulfill our obligation to repurchase shares 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  continued we also received approximately million in net proceeds from other sales of common stock through the exercise of previously issued warrants  the exercise of employee options  purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  issuance of shares to the chairman and ceo in lieu of cash salary payments  and o a million private placement of common stock 
see note of the notes to financial statements for additional details regarding the debt conversion and financing transactions 
we reported a net loss of approximately million and a net loss available to common stockholders of approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and deficit working capital of million 
these conditions raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have addressed  and continue to address  this doubt 
total revenue in increased to million over  while direct costs of services increased only to million versus million in the resulting gross margin increased from million in to million in the increase in revenue was principally due to the growth in subscriptions to our internet version of pc quote and other internet services 
this together with operating cost containment contributed to our gross margin improvement 
we expect continued revenue growth and gross margin improvement due to continued increases in subscriptions to our current internet services  new service offerings planned for release in and planned reductions in expenses related to leased equipment 
we believe the anticipated revenue growth and improved margins will result in our operations turning cash flow positive by the end of although we believe our gross margins will continue to improve  there can be no assurances that generated cash flow will be sufficient to fund operations 
if generated cash flow is not sufficient to fund operations  we may have to raise additional capital externally 
we raised a substantial amount of capital in through the debt conversion and exercise of warrants and other sales of common stock 
these transactions significantly improved our financial condition 
in order to minimize dilution to existing stockholders  our objective is to raise the minimal amount of capital for operations  if and when necessary 
we believe we have the ability to raise external capital 
however  any capital raised could be costly to us and or dilutive to stockholders 
additionally  we have explored  and continue to explore multiple alternatives that may be available for the purpose of enhancing stockholder value 
these alternatives include a merger  a spin off or sale of part of our business  a strategic relationship or joint venture with another technology or financial services firm and future equity financing to further fund our business 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will conclude a transaction 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued year issues overview pc quote does not have or use mainframe computers in its internal operations 
consequently  we do not have the extent of yk issues other companies have that depend on what is commonly known as legacy systems 
we use pc s and server class computers in our operations 
our end user applications also run on the same type of hardware 
these systems still may have yk issues 
we have implemented a plan to attempt to assess  remediate  and correct any year critical issues 
a year problem will occur where date sensitive software uses two digit year date fields  sorting the year before the year 
the year problem may result in data corruption and processing errors occurring where software  technology equipment  or any other equipment or process uses date dependent software 
our plan has been structured to address the following areas a 
processing plant and communications network b 
pc quote retail applications c 
operational infrastructure state of readiness we have approached each of the above areas in four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and contingency planning 
assessment summarizes the process of issue identification 
remediation refers to the process of taking corrective action to best mitigate identified year risks 
testing is the process of validating a specific pc quote remediation effort or confirming a third party capability or certification of year compliance 
contingency planning means the process by which we identify an alternate course of action and or procedure in the event we cannot or fail to remediate or mitigate a known year risk 
we may or may not engage in contingency planning for individual subproject components where successful year remediation has been validated through the testing process or other methods 
pc quote is preparing to participate in the full end to end year scenario test sponsored by the financial information forum in conjunction with the securities industry association 
this is an industry wide test to provide securities  options and futures exchanges and market data providers with the ability to test their systems under simulated year conditions 
time will essentially be moved forward into the year we are in preliminary testing that uses test data from participating exchanges to identify non compliant components that will need to be replaced prior to the full test 
this full end to end test  from the exchanges through market data vendors to the end user software application  is scheduled for may  the following is a status report on our state of readiness 
a 
processing plant and communications network assessment phase has been completed 
a full inventory has been taken of the processing plant  our data feed input  consolidation and output process  and communications areas 
we are currently in the remediation and testing phases 
this includes verifying yk compliance of outside vendors and suppliers and testing all mission critical items 
testing also includes all pc s  routers  modems  phone lines  internet service providers isp s  and production computers  known as servers  used internally in the communications room 
we are also checking our outbound satellite  phone companies and isp s distribution network  in addition to some isp s that our customers may use 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  year issues  continued the testing completion status as of is as follows 
areas equipment systems compliant processing plant communications network testing is scheduled to be completed by b 
pc quote retail applications our retail applications include proprietary and rd party software applications  licensed to our customers for use only with our data feed 
these applications include internet web site and browser based applications  local area network lan based applications  and windows nt client server applications 
one os based application will become obsolete in customers using this application will be converted to a compliant application 
applications compliant pc quote customer apps rd party customer apps c 
operational infrastructure we are assessing our main facility and field offices for compliance in the security systems  hvac systems  pagers  phone system  utility providers and other mission critical systems 
we have started to upgrade  at minimal cost  non compliant equipment 
based on our current assessment  we believe we will be able to meet our yk compliance goals 
costs as part of the ordinary course of our business  we continually develop major enhancements to our operating systems and applications 
for instance  we spent three years developing the first windows nt based processing plant that was put into production in in addition to many other benefits  it is fully yk compliant 
we have not in the past separately tracked the cost of yk remediation  as these efforts were incorporated into our on going maintenance and equipment replacement program 
we have started to track costs in and have spent approximately  so far this year on the cost of year this includes internal personnel resources  hardware  software and equipment replacement and upgrades necessary to be yk compliant 
we will be upgrading various administrative systems that use commercial third party software for accounting  billing and customer management 
the total remaining cost of software  replacement equipment  and internal resources for remediation and testing to become yk compliant is not expected to exceed  based upon currently available information  we do not believe that the cost of yk compliance will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  year issues  continued risks achieving yk compliance depends on many factors 
some factors may be beyond our control because we use services of others 
should our internal systems or the internal system of one of our critical vendors fail to achieve yk compliance and fail in the year  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
for example a piece of communications equipment has an internal clock that is not yk compliant 
although end to end testing is done  if for some reason  we or a vendor of ours fail to detect the non compliance 
yk comes and the clock shuts down  causing an inability to transmit over that channel 
our customers on that channel do not receive our service 
we or our vendor have the cost of finding and fixing the problem 
our customer could make a claim against us for the lost service 
many of our customers have back up systems in place with us which could mitigate any damage caused by the disruption 
in the event that there are claims for damages  our contracts with our customers limit our liability in such instances 
however  if there were a large number of customers affected for a prolonged period of time  we could be put in a position of either granting credits or risk losing the customers and our reputation could be adversely effected 
we have customers that use our quote tools to access our data feed for software applications 
quote tools is a set of programmer tools known as application programming interfaces or apis for short 
our quote tools are written and tested to be yk compliant 
if for some reason yk came and our quote tools did not function properly because of the date change  we would have to spend money and resources to fix the bug 
if the bug could not be fixed  and we had no alternative solution  for our customers using the service  we could lose the customers and related revenue 
our contracts with our customers generally limit our liability to total fees paid over the preceding year  which in was under  for quote tools customers 
contingency plans all testing  including internal infrastructure  is scheduled to be completed by we have not started extensive contingency planning because we are concentrating our efforts on remediation and testing 
we believe effective contingency planning should not begin until after these phases are complete 
we expect to begin comprehensive contingency planning at the start of the third quarter of effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements we will implement the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which is required to be adopted for financial statements issued for the fiscal year ending december  statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  by requiring us to recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
we believe that adoption of statement will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the sop provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and provides guidance for determining whether computer software is for internal use 
we will adopt the provisions of sop effective january  we are currently reviewing our software capitalization policies and evaluating the impact of this statement on our results of operations and financial position 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued other we do not believe general inflation materially impacts our sales and operating results 
we do not expect that current tax legislation will significantly affect our future financial position  liquidity or operating results 
at december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes and approximately  for the alternative minimum tax 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not previously utilized  as follows   and thereafter  see note of the notes to financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a bank term loan that has an interest rate equal to the bank s prime rate 
we are exposed to market risk as the prime rate is subject to fluctuations in the market 
we do not believe the market risk is material to our financial statements 
at december  we had excess cash invested in a money market account 
we do not expect any material loss  if at all  on this investment
