overview historically  the company has principally engaged in designing and manufacturing microwave components and subsystems for the defense industry 
in fiscal  the company expanded its capabilities in order to serve the emerging commercial wireless and satellite communications markets 
organizationally  the company operates predominately in the wireless communications  and space and defense markets 
the company s two reportable segments have been determined based upon the nature of the products and services offered  customer base  technology  availability of discrete internal financial information  homogeneity of products  delivery channel  and other factors 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company combined its satellite communications and defense electronics business groups into one new group called space and defense 
these two groups were combined to more efficiently utilize the engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources allocated to the separate groups 
increased commonality in the types of products and manufacturing processes required by the groups  coupled with a marked increase in new orders and development activity in the satellite area were the basis for the change 
the new combined entity  the space and defense group  will continue to focus on both the defense electronics and space communications markets 
the company recognized a tax benefit of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the dissolution of the company s european subsidiary 
the disposition of the net assets of the subsidiary and a corresponding restructuring charge were recognized for financial reporting purposes in in the fourth quarter of fiscal  all of the criteria necessary to support a deduction for the tax investment in the subsidiary were met and the tax benefit was recorded 
the company recognizes sales at the time products are shipped to its customers 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
the company believes that it develops a significant amount of intellectual capital through funded research and development 
customer funded design and development in fiscal represented approximately million in sales compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal operations for fiscal were highlighted by continuing escalation of commercial wireless sales  a resurgence of defense product sales and a significant improvement in operating margins and net income over fiscal net sales for the year ended june  were million  up from net sales of million for fiscal operating income for fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to million and of net sales in the prior year 
net income was million and per share diluted for fiscal  up significantly from net income of million and 
per share diluted for fiscal year status the company has conducted a full review of its computer systems to identify the programs and systems that could be affected by the year problem and has developed and is continuing to develop an implementation plan to resolve the problem 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits instead of four to define the applicable year 
programs with this problem may recognize a date using as the year instead of the year  resulting in system failures or miscalculations 
the company installed a major revision to its manufacturing software at the end of december  and has thoroughly tested the system for compliance with only minor problems encountered to date 
this system includes all the company s operating software from order entry through production planning and inventory control mrp and including all financial accounts payable  invoicing  receivable  purchasing and general ledger systems 
presently  the company is in the process of reviewing its pc based systems and network for compliance problems and has determined the applicable software upgrades that are required 
we are now awaiting pc and network operating system upgrades from microsoft which are certified yk compatible 
additionally  the company s yk committee has performed a room by room evaluation of all equipment in the company s facility and has determined which equipment requires a software upgrade to be compliant  and has completed a survey of all critical company vendors for compliance status 
required software upgrades have been ordered and  where deemed necessary  additional vendor resources are being evaluated for future use 
although no assurances can be given  the company presently believes that with additional modifications to existing software and conversion to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems 
the company intends to continue to review information systems for any possible problems  as well as monitor its key suppliers and customers for any impact that the year may have on their information systems which could impact the company 
the company does not believe that there will be significant issues or costs associated with its products related to year compliance  however  there can be no assurance that such products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions or that there do not exist heretofore undetected aspects of the company s manufacturing process which could be impacted by the year although the company is not currently aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its products  manufacturing processes or internal information systems for the year  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its products  manufacturing processes or internal information systems  which are comprised predominantly of third party software and hardware 
the company does not currently anticipate that the year programming issue will have a material impact on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
should the company not be completely successful in mitigating internal and external year risks  the result could be a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  manufacture products  and invoices or engage in similar normal business activities at the company or its vendors and suppliers 
the compay believes that under a worse case scenario  it could continue the majority of its normal business activities on a manual basis 
the company does not currently have a contingency plan with respect to potential year failures of its suppliers or customers
