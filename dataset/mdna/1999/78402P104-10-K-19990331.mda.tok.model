certain statements in the following discussion that are not historical in fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements regarding the company  its business  prospects and results of operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties posed by many factors and events that could cause the company s actual business  prospects and results of operations to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed below  and in year disclosure  and in periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission sec 
cyclical nature of medical malpractice insurance industry many factors influence the financial results of the medical malpractice insurance industry  several of which are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include  among other things  changes in severity and frequency of claims  changes in applicable law and regulatory reform  changes in judicial attitudes toward liability claims  and changes in inflation  interest rates and general economic conditions 
the availability of medical malpractice insurance  or the industry s underwriting capacity  is determined principally by the industry s level of capitalization  historical underwriting results  returns on investment and perceived premium rate adequacy 
historically  the financial performance of the medical malpractice industry has tended to fluctuate between a soft insurance market and a hard insurance market 
in a soft insurance market  competitive conditions could result in premium rates and underwriting terms and conditions that may be below profitable levels 
for a number of years  the medical malpractice insurance industry in california and nationally has faced a soft insurance market 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when industry conditions will improve or the extent to which any improvement in industry conditions may improve the company s financial condition and results of operations 
changing nature of the business the vast majority of the company s business is professional liability insurance for physicians written on a claims made and reported basis 
the company believes that the integration of healthcare delivery in recent years  particularly in california  will result in the growing importance of large medical groups and other healthcare entities  and a corresponding change in the entities that make professional liability purchasing decisions 
the company believes that these changes have created a need for the company to further diversify 
as a result  the company has adopted a strategy for growth that includes expanding the type of products offered by the company and diversifying geographically by offering products in states other than california 
the company began to implement its strategy in by offering professional liability insurance to hospitals in california and  in  began offering errors and omissions coverage for managed care organizations 
american healthcare indemnity company ahi  a subsidiary of scpie holdings  has formed a relationship with poe brown  inc poe brown one of the nation s top independent insurance agency organizations  to provide professional liability insurance to physicians commencing january  this coverage is currently offered to solo physicians and medical groups in five states  the largest such states being connecticut  florida  georgia and louisiana 
in  the company expects to offer this coverage in three additional states 
this replaces an existing program poe brown had established with another insurance company 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will successfully retain or expand this business through poe brown or that it will ultimately be profitable 
in addition  ahi acquired the medical malpractice insurance business of fremont indemnity company fremont effective january  through a quota share retroactive reinsurance agreement 
simultaneously  a quota share prospective fronting reinsurance agreement went into effect  making scpie indemnity the reinsurer for the fremont policies until ahi obtains the proper approvals to write this business directly 
the fremont policies are written through brokers in states  with the vast majority in california and arizona 
during the fourth quarter of  ahi received regulatory approval to write this business directly 
upon the policy s renewal date  each policy will be transferred from a fremont policy to an ahi policy 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will successfully retain or expand this business or that it will ultimately be profitable 
competitive environment the california medical malpractice insurance market for medical groups and physicians  in which the company principally operates  has become extremely competitive in recent years 
the company s principal competitors are three physician owned companies and a physicians mutual protection trust 
in addition  commercial insurance companies have recently returned to the california market to insure medical groups and physicians 
in the late s  many medical malpractice insurance companies began to experience significantly improved claims cost trends and attempted to attract medical groups and physicians insured by other companies by reducing premium rates 
beginning in  the company implemented annual rate decreases aggregating more than during the next three years  which resulted in a reduction in premium volume to approximately million in  and a deterioration of underwriting results 
between and  however  the company instituted annual overall rate increases ranging from to on its physician professional liability policies in order to improve its underwriting results 
these rate increases were higher than those implemented by most of its competitors 
as a result  the company has lost some of its policyholders  in part due to these rate increases  but realized a modest increase in its premium volume and has improved its underwriting results 
the company partially offset the effect of these rate increases through the payment of dividends to the members of the exchange in the form of premium credits based on the actual results of prior policy years 
the company ceased paying such premium credit dividends to its policyholders in the company instituted no rate increases for  which may have offset the elimination of dividends to policyholders and somewhat improved its competitive position 
during  the company will institute an average rate increase of for california physician insureds 
therefore  the company may find it more difficult to compete with other insurance companies offering such dividends 
loss and lae reserves medical malpractice and other property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves are established based on known facts and interpretation of circumstances  including the company s experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns  loss payments and pending levels of unpaid claims  as well as court decisions and economic conditions 
the effects of inflation are considered in the reserving process 
establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no assurance that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
the company follows a practice of conservatively estimating its future liabilities relating to losses already incurred and has attempted to establish its loss and lae reserves at the upper end of a reasonable range of reserve estimates 
the company believes that it has been particularly difficult to make such estimates for medical malpractice claims in california because of the uncertain benefits of tort reform measures and changes in the judicial process 
the company believes that a combination of these and other factors have contributed to the recent redundancies in reserves established by scpie for prior years 
the original reserves were established without full knowledge of the effect of these factors 
redundant reserves  which have been released in every year since  have contributed significantly to reported earnings in recent years 
the company reduced reserves for prior years by million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the redundancies recognized in were offset  in part  by a million increase in the loss and lae reserves for the medical malpractice insurance business assumed from fremont in january the strengthening of the fremont reserves was made in order to bring those reserves in line with the company s more conservative reserving policy 
the company cannot predict whether similar redundancies will be experienced in future years 
the company continues to establish its loss and lae reserves at what it believes is the upper end of a reasonable range of reserve estimates  but there is no assurance that such reserves will ultimately prove to be redundant 
the company believes that some reduction in the amount of the redundancies recently experienced is reasonably likely 
if such redundancies do not occur or loss and lae experience does not improve  the company s net income could be significantly reduced or a net loss could occur 
operating expenses with its continued expansion into other states and markets  the company has experienced an increase in its operating expense levels to achieve and service this expansion 
commissions for policies that are sold through agents and brokers typically range from to of premiums  whereas the company does not incur commissions on products sold directly 
hospital and other healthcare provider policies are typically sold through brokers  as are physician and medical group policies sold through poe brown and in the program acquired from fremont 
to the extent that these policies represent an increased percentage of the company s business in the future  expense ratios will increase 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  premiums earned premiums earned increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in the increase was principally due to a million increase in physician and medical group medical malpractice insurance premiums to approximately million in from million in this increase was a result of the company s acquisition of the medical malpractice book of business of fremont on january  and premiums attributable to an agency relationship with poe brown which commenced on january  hospital medical malpractice premiums were approximately million in compared to million in this decrease in hospital premiums is due principally to the loss of one large integrated hospital account in florida in late assumed reinsurance premiums  other than those received in the fremont and poe and brown arrangements  increased slightly in net investment income net investment income decreased approximately million  or  to million in from million in invested assets increased million to million in from million at december  the average pretax yield on the investment portfolio decreased to in compared to in due to a general decline in interest rates and a greater proportion of lower yielding  tax exempt securities in the portfolio 
realized investment gains and other revenue realized investment gains were approximately million in compared to million in in december sales were made in the fixed maturity portion of the investment portfolio to reposition the portfolio by increasing the percentage of corporate securities 
losses and lae losses and lae increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of premiums earned  losses and lae decreased to in from for the same period in for  the company reduced loss and lae reserves incurred in prior policy years approximately million as compared to a reserve reduction of million for for claims incurred in prior policy years 
the redundancies recognized in were offset  in part  by a million increase in the loss and lae reserves for the medical malpractice insurance business assumed from fremont in january the strengthening of those reserves was made in order to bring those reserves in line with the company s more conservative reserving policy 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the ratio of other operating expenses to premiums earned is referred to as the expense ratio  which increased to in from in this increase is due primarily to certain one time charges and the amortization of non recurring costs related to the acquisition of the fremont business 
additionally  other operating expenses include higher commission expenses associated with the greater percentage of business written through brokers in and general personnel increases necessary to produce and service the higher premium volume 
federal income taxes federal income taxes increased million  or  to million in from million in the effective tax rate increased to in from in  due primarily to higher realized gains in year ended december   compared to year ended december  premiums earned premiums earned increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in the increase was principally due to a million increase in hospital medical malpractice premiums and an increase of million increase in assumed reinsurance premiums 
medical malpractice premiums from physicians and medical groups were approximately million in compared to million in an average increase in premium rates in effect during was offset by a decrease in the average number of policies in force during as compared to hospital medical malpractice premiums were approximately million in compared to million in assumed reinsurance premiums were approximately million in  which includes million of assumed hospital premiums compared to million in net investment income net investment income increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in invested assets increased million to million in from million at december  the average pretax yield on the investment portfolio decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to lower yielding tax exempt bonds 
realized investment gains and other revenue realized investment gains were approximately million in compared to million in approximately million of the gains from resulted from the sale of equity securities in connection with the company s decision in the first quarter of to increase the focus of its investment portfolio on fixed maturity securities 
in  sales were made in the fixed maturity portion of the investment portfolio to reposition the portfolio by increasing the percentage of tax exempt securities 
losses and lae losses and lae increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of premiums earned  losses and lae increased to in from for the same period in for  the company reduced loss and lae reserves incurred in prior policy years approximately million as compared to a reserve reduction of million for for claims incurred in prior policy years 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was principally attributable to increases in policy acquisition expenses  payroll benefit expenses  and legal and consultation fees of million  million and million  respectively 
the expense ratio was in and in policyholder dividends the governing board of the exchange declared a final dividend to members of the exchange of record on november   who were also members of the exchange during policy years through such dividend was paid in the form of premium credits during this dividend of million offset by a million credit for forfeited dividends declared in was reflected as an expense for the year ended december  federal income taxes federal income taxes decreased million  or  to million in from million in the effective tax rate decreased to in from in  due primarily to an increase in tax exempt interest in liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of the company s liquidity are insurance premiums  net investment income  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
funds are used to pay losses  lae  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums and taxes 
the company has also paid significant dividends  in the form of premium credits  to its members in the years through the company paid million and million of such dividends during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company paid no policyholder dividends in  and has ceased paying such dividends to its policyholders 
the company has consistently experienced positive cash flow from operations 
because of uncertainty related to the timing of the payment of claims  cash from operations for a property and casualty insurance company can vary substantially from year to year 
cash provided by operating activities for the company was million in compared to million in the cash provided by operating activities in was before the payment of policyholder dividends 
the company invests its positive cash flow from operations in both fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
the company s current policy is to limit its investment in equity securities and real estate to no more than of the total market value of its investments 
accordingly  the company s portfolio of unaffiliated equity securities was million at december  the company plans to continue this focus on fixed maturity securities for the indefinite future 
the company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in high quality  short term securities to meet short term operating liquidity requirements  including the payment of losses and lae 
short term investments totaled million  or of invested assets  at december  the company believes that all of its short term and fixed maturity securities are readily marketable 
the company has made limited investments in real estate  which have been used almost entirely in the company s operating activities  with the remainder leased to third parties 
in july  the company entered into a lease covering approximately  square feet of office space for new company headquarters 
the lease is for a term of years and the company moved its headquarters and principal operations to this space in early march the company intends to lease its former headquarters to third parties 
the company expended million for leasehold improvements and equipment in the fourth quarter of  and estimates a total of million will be incurred 
scpie holdings is an insurance holding company whose assets primarily consist of all of the capital stock of its insurance company subsidiaries 
its principal sources of funds are dividends from its subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the insurance company subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in the amount of dividends they can pay in relation to earnings or surplus  without the consent of the applicable state regulatory authority  principally the california department of insurance 
scpie holdings principal insurance company subsidiary may pay dividends to scpie holdings in any year  without regulatory approval  to the extent such dividends do not exceed the greater of i of its statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year or ii its net income for the preceding year 
applicable regulations further require that an insurer s statutory surplus following a dividend or other distribution be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs  and permit the payment of dividends only out of statutory earned unassigned surplus unless the payment out of other funds receives regulatory approval 
the amount of dividends that the insurance company subsidiaries are able to pay to scpie holdings during without prior regulatory approval is approximately million 
dividends of million were paid to scpie holdings during common stock dividends paid to stockholders were per share in these dividends were funded through dividends from the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the company expects to pay dividends in the future 
however  payment of dividends is subject to board approval  earnings and the financial condition of the company 
the company has received a commitment from a large lender for a bank facility in the amount of million 
the commitment is subject to certain terms and conditions as well as negotiation and completion of all documentation 
the company expects to use this facility for general corporate purposes 
based on historical trends  market conditions and its business plans  the company believes that its sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs over the next months and beyond 
however  because economic  market and regulatory conditions may change  there can be no assurance that the company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet these liquidity needs 
the short and long term liquidity requirements of the company may vary because of the uncertainties regarding the settlement dates for unpaid claims 
during may  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
the repurchases may be made from time to time and continue until may since   shares were repurchased 
subsequent to december   an additional  shares were repurchased 
the board of directors may further extend the program s expiration date 
year the company relies heavily on information technology it systems and other systems and facilities such as telephones  building access control systems and heating and ventilation equipment embedded systems to conduct its business 
the company also has business relationships with health care providers  financial institutions  financial intermediaries  public utilities and other critical vendors as well as regulators and customers who are themselves reliant on it and embedded systems to conduct their businesses 
worldwide concerns have arisen over the ability of it and embedded systems to function properly on and after january  year 
the year concern is the result of many computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
systems that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  or as no date 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business operations 
state of readiness in  the company organized a multi disciplinary year project team 
the year project team has developed and is currently executing a comprehensive plan designed to make the company s mission critical it systems and embedded systems year ready 
outside consultants have reviewed the company s overall process  plan and progress to date 
the company s plan for it systems consists of four phases inventory identifying all it systems and risk rating each according to its potential business impact  assessment identifying it systems that use date functions and assessing them for year functionality  remediation reprogramming  or replacing where necessary  inventoried items to ensure they are year ready  and testing and certification testing the code modifications and new inventory with other associated systems  including extensive date testing and performing quality assurance testing to ensure successful operation in the post environment 
the company completed the remediation of substantially all of its mission critical it systems by year end the company believes that its year project is on schedule 
external relationships the company also faces the risk that one or more of its critical suppliers or customers external relationships will not be able to interact with the company due to the third party s inability to resolve its own year issues  including those associated with its own external relationships 
the company has completed its inventory of external relationships and risk rated each external relationship based upon the potential business impact  available alternatives and cost of substitution 
the company is attempting to determine the overall year readiness of its external relationships 
in the case of mission critical suppliers such as banks  financial intermediaries such as stock exchanges  telecommunications providers and other utilities  it vendors  financial market data providers  major physician groups and major hospitals  the company is engaged in discussions with the third parties and is attempting to obtain detailed information as to those parties year plans and state of readiness 
the company  however  does not have sufficient information at the current time to predict whether its external relationships will be year ready 
year costs year costs incurred were  and  in and  respectively and are currently estimated to be  in for a total of  a large majority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenses that will not recur in the year or thereafter 
the company expenses these costs as incurred and funds these costs through operating cash flows 
risks and contingency recovery planning if the company s year issues were unresolved  potential consequences would include  among other possibilities  the inability to accurately and timely process claims  update policyholders accounts  process financial transactions  bill policyholders  assess exposure to risks  determine liquidity requirements or report accurate data to management  stockholders  policyholders  regulators and others as well as business interruptions or shutdowns  financial losses  reputational harm  increased scrutiny by regulators and litigation related to year issues 
the company is attempting to limit the potential impact of the year by monitoring the progress of its own year project and those of its critical external relationships and by developing contingency recovery plans 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to resolve all of its year issues 
any critical unresolved year issues at the company or with its external relationships  however  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company has begun to develop contingency recovery plans aimed at ensuring the continuity of critical business functions before and after december  as part of that process  the company has begun to develop reasonably likely failure scenarios for its critical it systems and external relationships and the embedded systems in its critical facilities 
once these scenarios are identified  the company will develop plans that are designed to reduce the impact on the company  and provide methods of returning to normal operations  if one or more of those scenarios occur 
the company expects contingency recovery planning to be substantially complete by march  other factors affecting the company s businesses any critical unresolved year issues at the company or with its external relationships could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
in addition  the company s expectations about the future costs and timely and successful completion of its year program are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above under year factors that could influence the amount of future costs and the completion dates and effectiveness of remediation  testing and certification and contingency planning efforts include the company s success in identifying it systems and embedded systems that contain two digit year codes  the nature and amount of required reprogramming  testing and certification  the rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs  the availability of qualified personnel and the success of the company s external relationships in addressing their own year issues 
effect of inflation the primary effect of inflation on the company is considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae for claims in which there is a long period between reporting and settlement  such as medical malpractice claims 
the actual effect of inflation on the company s results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
based on actual results to date  the company believes that loss and lae reserve levels and the company s ratemaking process adequately incorporate the effects of inflation 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to various market risk exposures  including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity securities  which at december  comprised of total investments at market value 
us government and tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments  with the remainder consisting almost entirely of mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds 
equity securities  consisting primarily of common stocks  account for of total investment at market value 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments  which are primarily overnight bank repurchase agreements and short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that takes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the value of the common stock equity investments is dependent upon general conditions in the securities markets and the business and financial performance of the individual companies in the portfolio 
values are typically based on future economic prospects as perceived by investors in the equity markets 
the first two columns of the following table show the financial statement carrying values and related estimated fair values of certain of the company s financial instruments as of december  the third column shows the effect on current estimated fair values assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates and a decline in equity price sensitivity analysis 
estimated fair vale estimated fair vale at adjusted in thousands at current market market rates prices carrying value rates prices as indicated below interest rate risk fixed maturity securities available for sale    equity price risk common stocks    adjusted interest rates assume a basis point increase in market rates at december  adjusted equity prices assume a percent decline in values at december  for all its financial assets and liabilities  the company seeks to maintain reasonable average durations  consistent with the maximization of income without sacrificing investment quality and providing for liquidity and diversification 
the estimated fair values at current market rates for financial instruments subject to interest rate risk in the table above are the same as those disclosed in note investments to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair values at the adjusted market rates assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates are calculated using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling where appropriate 
the estimated values do not consider the effect that changing interest rates could have on prepayment activity 
this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of certain of the company s financial instruments 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited as it does not consider any actions the company could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates and equity prices
