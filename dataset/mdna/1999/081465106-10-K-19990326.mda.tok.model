in response to higher dairy costs  the company instituted a price increase effective in july for its packaged pint products and a combined price increase for its gallon bulk containers effective in january and july to offset these increased costs 
if dairy commodity prices begin to rise again to higher levels  there is the possibility that these costs will not be passed on to customers  which will negatively impact future gross profit margins

in addition  million cash was used to repurchase shares of the company s class a common stock and million was used to pay down debt and capital leases

year readiness disclosure background of year issues 
the year issue is the result of computer systems and software programs using two rather than four digits to define a year 
as a result  computer systems that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year unless remedied  the year issue could result in system failures  miscalculations  and the inability to process necessary transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition to computer systems and software  equipment using embedded chips  such as manufacturing and telephone equipment  could also be at risk 
state of readiness 
the company has developed  and is implementing a year plan to address year issues 
the plan focuses on the following three broad categories a information technology systems  b manufacturing facilities including embedded technology  and c external noncompliance by customers  distributors  suppliers and other business partners 
the company has substantially completed the inventory and assessment of the core software applications and hardware infrastructure 
the company has identified and is in various stages of remediating software and hardware deficiencies caused by the year issue 
the financial  human resources  manufacturing and distribution systems are currently being repaired  testing and validation of these systems are scheduled during the second quarter of the company s networking equipment is not compliant and is scheduled to undergo renovation and testing during the second quarter of as well 
while the company is continuing detailed assessment of its manufacturing facilities and embedded chip technology  it has not identified any problems thus far that would have a material impact upon operations 
the assessment phase for the manufacturing facilities is expected to be completed in april at the same time  the company is testing and remediating certain equipment and software systems known to have possible year issues and is expected to complete this phase during the second quarter of a critical step in this project is the coordination of year readiness with third parties 
the company is communicating with its significant suppliers  distributors and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable if the third parties fail to resolve their year issues 
the company will continue to assess and work with all of its major partners to understand the associated risks and plan for contingencies 
risks related to year issues 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems and that the internal year issues will be resolved in a timely manner 
however  the future compliance of year processing within the company is dependent upon key personnel  vendor software  vendor equipment and components 
in the unlikely event that no further progress is made on the company s year project  the company may be unable to manufacture or ship product  invoice customers or collect payments 
as a result  year issues could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and its financial results 
in addition  if systems operated by third parties including municipalities or utilities are not year compliant  this could also have a material adverse affect on the company 
costs to address year issues 
the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the year project  which are primarily the related payroll costs for its information systems is group 
there have been no incremental payroll costs related to the year project  however non critical is projects have been deferred due to concentration on year efforts 
the delay of these projects is not expected to have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the external costs for software  hardware  equipment and services related to the year project are expected to be approximately million 
the company will expense the costs of modifying existing systems and capitalize the replacement cost of software or equipment that is not year compliant 
there can be no guarantee  however  that the systems of other entities which the company relies upon will be converted on a timely basis or that any failure to convert by another entity would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems and operations 
contingency plans 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  including uncertainty regarding the year readiness of suppliers  distributors and other manufacturers  the company is developing contingency plans 
this process includes  among others  developing backup procedures in case of systems failures  identifying alternative production plans and developing alternative plans to engage in business activities with customers  distributors and suppliers that are not experiencing year problems 
the above forward looking statements with regard to the timing and overall cost estimates of the company s efforts to address the year problem are based upon the company s experience thus far in this effort 
should the company encounter unforeseen difficulties either in the continuing review of its internal systems  the ultimate remediation  or the responses of its business partners  the actual results could vary significantly from the estimates in these forward looking statements 
forward looking statements this section  as well as other portions of this document  includes certain forward looking statements about the company s business  new products  sales  dairy prices  other expenditures and cost savings  year program costs  effective tax rate  operating and capital requirements and refinancing 
any such statements are subject to risks that could cause the actual results or needs to vary materially 
these risks are discussed below 
risk factors dependence on independent ice cream distributors 
historically  the company has been dependent on maintaining satisfactory relationships with dreyer s grand ice cream  inc dreyer s and the other independent ice cream distributors that have acted as the company s exclusive or master distributor in their assigned territories 
in  dreyer s distributed significantly more than a majority of the sales of ben jerry s products 
while the company believes its relationships with dreyer s and its other distributors generally have been satisfactory and have been instrumental in the company s growth  the company has at times experienced difficulty in maintaining such relationships to its satisfaction 
in addition  in early dreyer s made overtures to ben cohen and jerry greenfield  the company s co founders  to obtain their support for an offer that dreyer s would make to acquire the company 
the co founders rejected these overtures 
in august january  the company redesigned its distribution network  entering into a distribution agreement with the pillsbury company pillsbury and a new agreement with dreyer s 
these arrangements take effect september   except for certain territories  which are effective  in april may the company believes the terms of the new arrangements will  on balance  be more favorable to its company and expects that  under the distribution network redesign  no one distributor will account for more than of the company s net sales 
however  both pillsbury  through its haagen daz unit  and dreyer s are competitors of the company 
since available distribution alternatives are limited  there can be no assurance that difficulties in maintaining satisfactory relationships with pillsbury  dreyer s and its other distributors  some of which are also competitors of the company  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
see business markets and customers growth in sales and earnings 
in  net sales of the company increased to million from million in pint volume increased compared to the super premium ice cream  frozen yogurt and sorbet industry category sales increased in as compared to given these overall domestic super premium industry trends  the successful introduction of innovative flavors on a periodic basis has become increasingly important to sales growth by the company 
accordingly  the future degree of market acceptance of any of the company s new products  which will be accompanied by significant promotional expenditures  is likely to have an important impact on the company s and future financial results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
competitive environment 
the super premium frozen dessert market is highly competitive with the distinctions between the super premium category  and the adjoining premium and premium plus categories less marked than in the past 
as noted above  the ability to successfully introduce innovative flavors on a periodic basis that are accepted by the marketplace is a significant competitive factor 
in addition  the company s principal competitors are large  diversified companies with resources significantly greater than the company s  two of which are distributors for the company 
the company expects strong competition to continue  including competition for adequate distribution and competition for the limited shelf space for the frozen dessert category in supermarkets and other retail food outlets 
see business competition and business the super premium frozen dessert market 
increased cost of raw materials 
management believes that the general trend of increased dairy ingredient commodity costs may continue and it is possible that at some future date both gross margins and earnings may not be adequately protected by pricing adjustments  cost control programs and productivity gains 
reliance on a limited number of key personnel 
the success of the company is significantly dependent on the services of perry odak  the chief executive officer  and a limited number of executive managers working under mr 
odak  as well as certain continued services of jerry greenfield the chairperson of the board and co founder of the company  and ben cohen  vice chairperson and co founder of the company 
loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
see directors and executive officers of the company 
the company s social mission 
the company s basic business philosophy is embodied in a three part mission statement  which includes a social mission to operate the company in a way that actively recognizes the central role that business plays in the structure of society by initiating innovative ways to improve the quality of life of a broad community local  national and international 
underlying the mission of ben jerry s is the determination to seek new and creative ways of addressing all three parts  while holding a deep respect for individuals inside and outside the company and for the communities of which they are a part 
the company believes that implementation of its social mission  which is being more integrated into the company s business  has been beneficial to the company s overall financial performance 
however  it is possible that at some future date the amount of the company s energies and resources devoted to its social mission could have some material adverse financial effect 
see business introduction and business marketing 
international 
total international net sales represented approximately of total consolidated net sales in the company s principal competitors have substantial market shares in various countries outside the united states  principally europe and japan 
the company sells product in japan  canada  the united kingdom  ireland  france  the netherlands  belgium and will start selling in peru and lebanon in in  the company granted an exclusive license to manufacture and sell ben jerry s products in israel 
in february  the company made an investment commitment in the israeli licensee  which gave the company a ownership interest 
in may  the company signed a licensing agreement with delicious alternative desserts  ltd 
to manufacture  sell and distribute ben jerry s products through the wholesale distribution channels in canada 
the company is investigating the possibility of further international expansion 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in entering directly or indirectly through licensing  on a long term profitable basis  such international markets as it selects 
control of the company 
the company has two classes of common stock the class a common stock  entitled to one vote per share  and the class b common stock authorized in  entitled  except to the extent otherwise provided by law  to ten votes per share 
ben cohen  jerry greenfield and jeffrey furman collectively the principal stockholders hold shares representing of the aggregate voting power in elections for directors  permitting them as a practical matter to elect all members of the board of directors and thereby effectively control the business  policies and management of the company 
because of their significant holdings of class b common stock  the principal stockholders may continue to exercise this control even if they sell substantial portions of their class a common stock 
see security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
in addition  the company issued all of the authorized class a preferred stock to the foundation in all current directors of the foundation are directors of the company 
the class a preferred stock gives the foundation a class voting right to act with respect to certain business combinations as defined in the company s charter and significantly limits the voting rights that holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock  the owners of virtually all of the equity in the company  would otherwise have with respect to such business combinations 
see business the ben jerry s foundation 
also  in april  the legislature of the state of vermont amended a provision of the vermont business corporation act to provide that the directors of a vermont corporation may also consider  in determining whether an acquisition offer or other matter is in the best interests of the corporation  the interests of the corporation s employees  suppliers  creditors and customers  the economy of the state in which the corporation is located and including the possibility that the best interests of the corporation may be served by the continued independence of the corporation 
also in august   following approval by its board of directors  the company put in place two shareholder rights plans  one pertaining to the class a common stock and one pertaining to the class b common stock 
these plans are intended to protect stockholders by compelling someone seeking to acquire the company to negotiate with the company s board of directors in order to protect stockholders from unfair takeover tactics and to assist in the maximization of stockholder value 
these rights plans  which are common for public companies in the united states  may also be deemed to be anti takeover provisions in that the board of directors believes that these plans will make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company on terms which are unfair or unfavorable to the stockholders 
while the board of directors believes that the class b common stock and the class a preferred stock are important elements in keeping ben jerry s an independent  vermont based business focused on its three part corporate mission  the class b common stock and the class a preferred stock may be deemed to be anti takeover provisions in that the board of directors believes the existence of these securities will make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company on terms opposed by the holders of the class b common stock  including primarily the principal stockholders  or the foundation  or for incumbent management and the board of directors to be removed 
in addition  the amendments to the company s articles of association to classify the board of directors and to add certain other related provisions  the april vermont legislative amendment of the vermont business corporation act and the shareholder rights plans put in place in august  see anti takeover effects of class b common stock  class a common stock  class a preferred stock  classified board of directors  vermont legislation and shareholder rights plans in item may be deemed to be anti takeover provisions in that the board of directors believes that these amendments and legislation will make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company on terms opposed by the holders of the class b common stock  including primarily the principal stockholders and the foundation  or for incumbent management and the board of directors to be removed 
item a 
market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio

certificates of deposits do not expose the consolidated statement of operations or balance sheets to fluctuations in interest rates
