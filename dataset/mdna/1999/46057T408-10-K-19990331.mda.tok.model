as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
the company and third parties with which the company does business rely on numerous computer programs in their day to day operations 
the company has begun the process of identifying computer systems that could be affected by the year issue as it relates to the company s internal hardware and software  as well as third parties which provide the company goods or services

as of the first quarter of  testing  remediation and replacement had commenced for all categories 
the company has not developed a contingency plan that would be utilized if current efforts by the company and its vendors are unsuccessful

the credit facility matures on march  because the interest rate on the credit facility is variable  the company s cash flow may be affected by increases in the prime rate
