item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company develops  produces and distributes a broad range of television programming  and in the past year has expanded its feature motion picture development efforts 
historically  the company has produced most of its programming for third parties on a fee for services basis 
fees paid to the company for these production services generally range from  to  per episode and typically cover all direct production costs plus a profit margin 
the company has begun to produce programming for which it controls some of the proprietary rights associated with such programming including  for example  international distribution and licensing and merchandising rights 
fees paid to the company for these production services typically do not cover all direct production costs 
generally  the company seeks to cover at least of its production costs prior to production of its proprietary programs and seeks to cover the remaining production costs through the exploitation of the proprietary rights associated with these programs 
as a result  the company may recognize revenue associated with its proprietary programming over a period of years 
the company produces a limited number of animated television series in any year and is substantially dependent on revenues from licensing these programs to broadcasters 
the company s future performance will be affected by issues facing all producers of animated programming  including risks related to the limited number of time slots allocated to children s and or animated television programming  the intense competition for those time slots  the limited access to distribution channels particularly for programs produced by independent studios  the declining license fees paid to producers of programming by broadcasters and the regulations implemented by the federal communications commission governing program content 
while the company seeks to limit its financial risk associated with its proprietary programming by obtaining commitments prior to production to cover at least of its direct production costs  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to cover the balance of its production costs and overhead costs relating to production  licensing and distribution through the exploitation of its proprietary rights 
as a result of the foregoing risks  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate revenues that exceed its costs 
the company is currently seeking to enter into new business areas beyond its core business of animation television production such as live action television production  feature film production both live action and animation  computer generated animation and direct to video production both live action and animation and alternative forms of distribution 
the company s future performance will be affected by unpredictable and changing factors that influence the success of an individual television program  feature film or direct to video release such as personal taste of the public and critics as well as public awareness of a production and the successful distribution of a production 
although the company intends to attempt to limit the risks involved with television  film and direct to video production  the company will likely be unable to limit all financial risk  and the level of marketing  promotional and distribution activities and expenses necessary for such production cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company has a very limited history of developing  producing or distributing live action television  computer generated animation or film productions  and there can be no assurance that the company can compete successfully with more established persons or entities 
live action production involves many of the risks associated with animation production as well as additional risks inherent to live action that are outside of the company s control 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the risk of strike by actors and film crew  increased union activity  delay in production due to weather and other local conditions  inability to obtain proper permitting at a desired site  at desired times and or under desired terms  and accidents or injury to actors and film crew 
no assurance can be given that the company will produce any live action television  film or direct to video productions or that  if produced  such productions will be profitable 
in the first quarter of  the company decided to reduce its fixed overhead by outsourcing its licensing and merchandising  public relations  promotion  and advertising to third party suppliers 
the company will consider bringing these functions in house again  should the volume indicate that such action would be prudent 
revenue and cost recognition the company follows fasb for accounting practices related to revenue recognition and amortization of production costs for its fee for services and proprietary programming 
revenues from license and production agreements  which may provide for the receipt by the company of nonrefundable guaranteed amounts  are recognized when the license period begins and the programming is available pursuant to the terms of the agreement  typically when the finished episode has been delivered to or made available to and accepted by the customer 
amounts in excess of minimum guarantees under such agreements are recognized when earned 
cash collected in advance of the time of availability of programming is recorded as deferred revenue million at december  
all costs incurred in connection with an individual program or film  including acquisition  development  production and allocable production overhead costs and interest are capitalized as film costs 
at december   the company s capitalized film costs balance was million 
these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value 
estimated total production costs for an individual program or film are amortized in the proportion that revenue realized relates to management s estimate of the total revenue expected to be received from such program or film 
estimated liabilities for third party participations are accrued and expensed in the same manner as film costs are amortized 
due to the inherent uncertainties of forecasting both total revenue and total expense  at any time one or the other can be overstated or understated  resulting in potential adjustments to the amortization rate or net realizable value calculation 
the company s cash flows are not necessarily related to revenue recognition and amortization of production costs 
cash is received and costs are incurred and paid throughout the year 
historically  in the fourth quarter  and to a lesser extent the third quarter  cash used in operations typically exceeded cash generated by operations as completed shows were delivered to broadcasters 
the company expects that cash used in or provided by operations will fluctuate greatly from quarter to quarter  due in part  to the international sales and collections cycle related to the programs in its library 
overhead allocation overhead is allocated to particular productions on the basis of the total allocable overhead times the ratio of direct production costs incurred on a program to total production costs incurred during the period 
total allocable overhead is determined on the basis of management s estimates of the percentage of overhead costs which can be attributed to the productions in progress during the period 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  total revenue decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
total revenue decreased in part  because the company delivered fewer episodes of programming in as compared to the company delivered a total of episodes of programming for the year ended december  as compared to episodes delivered in however  the primary reason for the decrease in total revenue is that in september  united paramount network upn and the company entered into a settlement whereby upn compensated the company for a portion of the costs associated with blues brothers the animated series blues brothers 
upn had initially ordered the series and subsequently cancelled its order while the series was in production 
the company s investment amounted to approximately million as of december   and the company received revenue of million and recorded a write off for the year ended december   of approximately million 
the company delivered fee for services episodes during the year ended december   compared to episodes in fee for services revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in as a result of delivering no saturday morning episodes 
the company delivered proprietary episodes for the year ended december   compared to episodes in proprietary revenue consists of revenue derived from the us license fees paid upon the initial delivery of a new episode of proprietary programming to a us broadcaster and from the exploitation of the proprietary rights eg  merchandising  licensing and or international distribution rights associated with the proprietary episodes in the company s library that were initially delivered in prior periods 
proprietary revenue decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in this decrease resulted from blues brothers settlement revenue being included in but not  and lower international sales of the company s library programming in other revenue increased by approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due primarily to higher revenues from commercials and specials  and net profit participations  offset by lower interactive revenue and other creative services revenue 
total cost of revenue decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  total cost of revenue as a percentage of sales decreased by  to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  costs as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily because the costs for the twelve months ended december  included a write off related to the blues brothers as discussed earlier 
the overall decrease was partially offset by a write down to net realizable value as a result of changes in the company s estimated future revenues from certain of its episodic programming 
total selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the comparable period in  due primarily to an increase in the cost of the company s development infrastructure and an increase in the expense of certain development costs  as well as an accrual for the charges related to the company s termination of its employment contract with the founder of the company 
these increases were partially offset by outsourcing the company s licensing and merchandising activities 
operating loss was million for the year ended december   as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared with year ended december  total revenue decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
total revenue decreased primarily because the company delivered significantly fewer episodes of programming in as compared to the company delivered a total of episodes of programming for the year ended december  as compared to episodes delivered in the company delivered fee for services episodes during the year ended december   compared to episodes in fee for services revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in as a result of delivering more prime time episodes which generally generate higher per episode fees than saturday morning episodes 
the company delivered proprietary episodes for the year ended december   compared to episodes in proprietary revenue consists of revenue derived from the us license fees paid upon the initial delivery of a new episode of proprietary programming to a us broadcaster and from the exploitation of the proprietary rights eg  merchandising  licensing and or international distribution rights associated with the proprietary episodes in the company s library that were initially delivered in prior periods 
proprietary revenue decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in this decrease was a result of significantly fewer proprietary episodes being delivered partially offset by million in revenue from the blues brothers settlement with upn and continued international sales of the company s library programming 
other revenue decreased by approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due primarily to lower revenues from commercials and specials  interactive revenues and net profit participations 
total cost of revenue decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  total cost of revenue as a percentage of sales remained constant at for both and total selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the comparable period in  due primarily to increased professional fees  the write off of certain development costs and ongoing costs of operating a public company 
operating loss was million for the year ended december   as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and short term investments of approximately million compared to million at december  and million at december  the company s cash and short term investment balances have continued to decline since december  and the company expects to experience further declining balances during the remainder of fiscal management believes that its existing cash balances and short term investments  combined with anticipated cash flow from operations  will nevertheless be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through the end of fiscal however  if the company is successful in the execution of its more aggressive and broad production strategies  it will be required to make additions to personnel and augment its development and production capabilities in the areas of animated programming  computer generated animated programming  live action television series  feature films and direct to video films 
in such a case  the company may need to secure additional equity or debt financing prior to the end of fiscal in order to fulfill its growth strategies 
recent operating losses  the company s declining cash balances  trends in the entertainment industry adversely affecting independent production companies similar to the company  and the company s historical stock performance may make it difficult for the company to attract equity investments on terms that are deemed to be favorable to the company 
in addition  the losses in fiscal and fiscal make it more difficult for the company to attract significant debt financing 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in arranging for additional equity or debt financing at levels sufficient to meet its planned needs 
the failure to obtain such financing could have an adverse affect on the implementation of the company s growth strategies 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million due to use of cash in connection with film production activities offset by an increase in deferred revenue and fluctuations in other operating assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   net cash used for investing activities was million due to additions to property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   was million due primarily from the receipt of proceeds from the offering 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million due to non cash amortization of film cost being greater than cash spent on film cost additions and cash generated in connection with a decrease in accounts receivable  offset by fluctuations in other operating assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   net cash used for investing activities was million due to additions to property and equipment 
the company had minimal financing activities during for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million primarily due to cash used in connection with film production activities and a decrease in accounts payable offset by an increase in deferred revenue and an increase in accrued expenses 
for the year ended december   net cash used for investing activities was million due to additions to property and equipment 
the company had minimal financing activities during the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
fas 
cash collected in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
as of december   the company had a balance in its deferred revenue account of million 
the net cost to the company future receipts less future expenditures to finish the programs for which cash has been collected in advance and included in deferred revenue is approximately million 
management believes that the company s cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operating requirements for at least the next year 
impact of year general overview the company s year project is currently proceeding on schedule 
the company began its assessment in the spring of in response to a need to address the issue of older computer programs and embedded computer chips inability to distinguish between the year and the year critical programs with the company were written to use two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  those programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this programming method could cause a system failure or miscalculation which could cause the disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the current assessment project schedule is to be year compliant by mid in all areas within the company 
areas deemed critical with potential to affect the company s ability to do business ie computer server room  finance  human resources  legal are year compliant at this time 
project the company s year project is divided into three sections applications software  communications systems telephones  voicemail  etc 
and infrastructure 
the methodology used to assess these three primary sections includes a prioritizing by critical area  b inventorying for potential year problems ie computer workstations  servers  software  c repairing recoding program code where applicable and or replacing hardware software as necessary  d testing material items  and e designing and implementing contingency and business continuation plans for the company 
as of march   the priority assessment has been completed as it relates to the company s computer systems 
year issues as they relate to the physical premises building power  incoming phone service  etc 
are outside the company s control and correspondence inquiring as to year compliance has been delivered to the principals of the building s property management  phone system suppliers  alarm system suppliers and communications service providers ie mci  pacific bell 
the results thus far indicate that the company s internal alarm systems and communications systems are year compliant 
the concern now is whether or not incoming services are year compliant 
because it is not possible to gauge the readiness of third party vendors  the company is in the process of drafting a contingency plan in the event that the company s third party vendors do not complete their year implementations in time 
this contingency plan is scheduled to be drafted and implemented by mid inventorying of potential year systems is approximately complete overall within the company and complete in areas deemed critical 
the company is currently investigating year inventorying systems that will guarantee that all inventorying of non critical areas will be completed by march as of march   the main accounting system in use by the company  show auditor  has been recoded to comply with year issues and has been tested as compliant 
software changes have also been implemented within the company s network servers  human resources division  international division and legal divisions to meet year compliance 
compliance is also about completed at the desktop application level word processing  spreadsheets and operating systems at each of the company s computer workstations 
this has been accomplished by either installing the latest software patches  upgrading software or replacing software as necessary 
the company s communications systems are year compliant as mentioned above  therefore  recoding or replacing is not necessary at this time 
the company has instituted a policy of buying only year compliant computer systems and applications to assure that all new machines are year compliant 
further  the company acquired hardware technology from micro  inc to insert into older computer systems to make them year compliant at the hardware level 
as of march   the centurion yk hardware card has been tested and implemented 
all infrastructure activities are expected to be completed by mid the company expects to begin final testing on all internal applications software and hardware systems by march  the purpose of this phase is to assure that all year compliance changes are in fact working as expected 
this phase will also involve the installation of any last minute software patches as provided by software developers manufacturers 
testing of communications systems and infrastructure systems will also occur at this time 
the company is involved in prioritizing non computer related systems to assess their potential impact to the company s operations 
these systems would include operations such as delivery services  materials suppliers  etc 
a contingency plan to address any of these systems which prove to be critical to the company s operations will be drafted by the company and implemented by mid costs the total cost of the required modifications necessary to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position and is estimated at approximately  this does not include the company s potential share of year costs that may be incurred by the company by way of partnerships and joint ventures in which the company participates but is not the controlling entity 
accordingly  the foreseeable costs arising from such third party relationships cannot be determined at this time 
the total amount expended on the year project through march  was  which was related to the cost to repair or replace software and related hardware problems 
risks the failure to correct material year problems could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business operations 
these failures could potentially materially affect the company s results of operations and financial condition  however  due to the general uncertainty which is inherent in potential year problems  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers  customers or partners  the company is unable to determine  at this time  whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the year assessment project is the company s response to this potential problem and is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and the compliance and readiness of its material third party vendors 
the company believes that with the implementation of new systems and completion of the year project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions affecting the company s operations should be reduced 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in this year disclosure should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading  risk factors 
readers should understand that the dates on which the company believes the year project will be completed are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the company s year compliance project 
a delay in specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  the ability to correct all relevant computer code  timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced  and similar uncertainties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of year readiness of third parties and the inter connection of national and international businesses  the company cannot ensure that its ability to timely and cost effectively resolve problems associated with the year issue may not affect its operations and business  or expose it to third party liability 
risks factors dependence on a limited number of television programs 
our revenue has historically come from the production of a relatively small number of animated television programs 
the simpsons  king of the hill  and the mr 
potato head show accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue for the year ended december  as audiences tastes change frequently  we cannot assure you that broadcasters will continue to broadcast our proprietary or fee for services programs or that we will continue to be engaged to produce 
we currently enjoy limited profit participation and or limited licensing and merchandising participation in king of the hill  family guy  and the downtowners 
however  we cannot assure you that o those shows will remain on the air  o we will continue to produce them  or o they will be sufficiently successful to generate participation to us while we continually endeavor to develop new programming  there can be no assurance that revenue from existing or future programming will replace a possible loss of revenue associated with the cancellation of any particular program 
impact of fcc regulations requiring educational content programming certain fcc rules may adversely affect the number of time slots available for our productions 
these regulations strongly encourage broadcasters through license renewal procedures to offer at least three hours per week of programming specifically designed to serve the educational and information needs of children ages and under  identify each program as educational  schedule this programming weekly  and offer this programming in minute formats 
while the full impact of the regulations on aggregate demand for children s programming remains uncertain  we have experienced some significant impact 
cbs  one of our primary customers over the years  elected to change its programming slate to conform to the fcc regulations 
in its first year implementing this strategy  cbs did not order any new animated programming from us 
in its second year of implementation  cbs reduced its license fees 
in addition  it is possible that programming qualifying for the new fcc requirements will have a competitive advantage over non qualifying programs 
this could further diminish the number of time slots available for our existing programs  thus intensifying the strong competition for the remaining time slots 
risks of vertical integration over the last decade  broadcasters  distributors and producers of televison and motion picture programming have become increasingly integrated vertically through mergers  acquisitions  partnerships  joint ventures or other affiliations 
we have not entered into any of these relationships 
these relationships  coupled with the recent repeal of certain regulations of the fcc which had limited the ability of network broadcasters to control certain rights in television programming  has resulted in broadcasters working with their affiliated producers of animated programming 
this result limits the number of time slots available for other producers 
we cannot assure you that the number of time slots currently available for children s and or animated programming and  specifically  for animated programming supplied by independent animation studios  will not decrease  or that we will compete successfully for available time slots 
declining value of license fee agreements and increasing control of proprietary rights by broadcasters competition created by the emergence of new broadcasters such as upn  wb  nickelodeon and the usa network has provided television audiences with more choices  thereby generally reducing the number of viewers watching any one program 
as a result  the market share of  and license fees paid by  fox  cbs and abc have decreased 
there continues to be intense competition for the time slots offered by the networks  especially fox  cbs and abc 
this trend continues to depress license fees to a level that may make it difficult for us to finance certain proprietary programs 
moreover  broadcasters are demanding a greater percentage of the revenue generated from the exploitation of proprietary rights associated with the programs which they license 
broadcasters may also seek to control and exploit all of the proprietary rights associated with the programs which they license 
we believe that these industry wide trends may have a significant adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
it is possible that our current programs may not sustain their popularity and our new programs may not become popular we derive substantially all of our revenue from the production and distribution of animated television programs 
each production is an individual artistic work  and consumer reaction will determine its commercial success 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to create entertaining episodes for our existing programs or that we will be able to create new programs that are appealing to broadcasters 
when advertisers decide whether to pay for advertising during a program s broadcast  they look closely at neilsen ratings 
broadcasters also consider neilsen ratings when deciding whether to renew a series or license a new series 
producers of syndicated programming  like us  often receive payments from syndicators based on a share of the revenue received from advertisers who advertise during a specific program 
we try to develop and produce programming that will perform well in the nielsen ratings system 
nielsen ratings for our programming depend on many factors beyond our control  including o audience reaction  o competing programming  o availability of alternative forms of entertainment  o time slots when aired and o critical reviews we cannot assure you that our programs will obtain favorable nielsen ratings or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our programs in development or will renew licenses to broadcast programs which we currently produce 
even if a broadcaster renews the license to broadcast our programming  we cannot guarantee that our program will remain popular 
if our programming becomes less popular  we will most likely derive less revenue which could impact our financial condition 
our revenues result from sales to a limited number of major customers 
during the year ended december   we derived approximately and of our net sales from our top two customers  twentieth television a division of twentieth century fox and fox kids network 
neither of these customers is contractually obligated to continue to do business with us 
in order to be successful  we must continue our relationships with these customers  we must continue to develop relationships with new customers  and our existing programs must continue to be broadcast 
in the event our relationship with either of our top customers terminates  we could experience an adverse impact on our business 
risks related to expansion of production of proprietary programming we produce substantially all of our programming on a fee for services basis 
as a result  we do not typically own or control licensing or distribution rights  but may have profit participation rights based on a percentage of adjusted gross profits or net profits earned by the owners of these distribution rights 
the fees we receive for these production services typically cover all direct production costs plus a margin 
we intend to expand our production of programming for which we own or control licensing and or distribution rights proprietary programming 
these rights may include domestic and international broadcast distribution  home video distribution  licensing and merchandising  feature film and interactive game development proprietary rights 
while we seek to limit the financial risk associated with our proprietary programming by obtaining commitments prior to production to cover at least of our direct production costs  we cannot be sure that we will be able to recover the balance of our production and overhead costs through the exploitation of our remaining rights 
we derived million  and million  in revenues from proprietary programming for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since we only recently have begun to retain the proprietary rights associated with our animated programs  we have a limited history of operations and experience related to the exploitation of these rights 
risk of budget and cost overruns we review cost reports and update our cost projections regularly 
although we have generally completed each of our productions within its budget  we cannot assure you that the actual production costs for our programming will remain within budget 
risks such as production delays  higher talent costs  increased subcontractor costs  political instability overseas  and other unanticipated events may substantially increase production costs and delay completion of the production of any one or more of our programs 
risks related to overestimation of revenue or underestimation of costs we follow financial accounting standards board statement no 
 individual film forecast fasb  regarding revenue recognition and amortization of production costs 
all costs incurred in connection with an individual program or film  including acquisition  development  production and allocable production overhead costs and interest  are capitalized as television and film costs 
these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value 
we amortize our estimated total production costs for an individual program or film in the proportion that revenue realized relates to management s estimate of the total revenue expected to be received from such program or film 
as a result  if revenue or cost estimates change with respect to a program or film  we may be required to write down all or a portion of our unamortized costs for the program or film 
we cannot assure you that these write downs will not have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
seasonality our results of operations depend on our production and delivery schedule of television programs 
broadcasters typically make most of their annual programming commitments in the first and second quarters of any calendar year so that new programs will be ready for delivery in the third quarter and  to a greater extent  the fourth quarter of that year 
producers typically recognize revenues from license and production agreements when the producer delivers the finished product to the customer and the customer accepts it 
as a result of the production cycle  we do not recognize revenue evenly throughout the year 
we typically recognize a significant portion of our revenue in the fourth quarter 
our results of operations fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the results of any one period do not necessarily indicate results for future periods 
cash flows also fluctuate and do not necessarily correlate with revenue recognition competition programming 
the creation  development  production and distribution of television programming  together with the exploitation of the proprietary rights related to such programming  is a highly competitive business 
we compete with producers  distributors  licensors and merchandisers  many of whom are larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
although the number of outlets available to producers of animated programming has increased with the emergence of new broadcasters  the number of time slots available to independent producers of children s and animated programming remains limited 
moreover  because license fees in the united states have dropped substantially recently  companies that do not rely on us broadcast license fees to finance the production of animation programming  particularly international animation companies which receive governmental subsidies  have achieved a competitive advantage 
these companies now serve as an additional source of competition for the limited slots available to independent animation companies 
we also believe that we face competition from a variety of companies in three principal areas for the time slots for animated programming offered by broadcasters  for the acquisition of characters  story lines  plots and ideas and for the right to license and distribute our products throughout the united states and internationally 
creative properties and creative personnel 
we compete with other animation companies for characters  storylines  plots and ideas created by third parties 
third parties select us based on their perception of whether we are best able to create and develop a successful program from the initial idea or character 
we also compete with other animation companies including the film and television animation operations of major studios for the animators  writers  producers and other creative personnel needed to successfully develop and produce animated programming 
we believe that we compete for creative properties and creative personnel with a variety of companies including the walt disney company  warner bros  hanna barbera  dic  klasky csupo  marvel entertainment  saban entertainment  cinar films  dreamworks skg  nelvana  universal cartoon studios  sony cartoon studios and hyperion productions  many of which have greater financial resources to obtain creative properties and creative personnel 
licensing and merchandising 
in the first quarter of  we decided to reduce our fixed overhead by outsourcing our licensing and merchandising activities 
however  we expect that the exploitation of our licensing and merchandising rights will remain an important part of our strategy 
we compete with other owners of creative content who seek to license their characters and properties to a limited number of distributors 
in connection with our recent initiatives to exploit the proprietary rights associated with our programming  we have entered into several licensing and merchandising agreements 
however  for the year ended december   we derived no significant revenue from our licensing and merchandising activities and we cannot assure you that we will derive significant revenue in the future 
risks related to international operations risks of international business generally 
part of our strategy involves our current and planned activities in a number of developing nations 
there are many risks inherent in our international business activities 
our projects could be adversely affected by o reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets to new competitors  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o export controls  tariffs and other barriers  o currency fluctuations  o investment policies  o nationalization  expropriation and limitations on repatriation of cash  and o social and political risks overseas subcontractors 
like other producers of animated programming  we subcontract some of the less creative and more labor intensive components of our production process to animation studios located in low cost labor countries  primarily in the far east 
as the number of animated feature films and animated television programs increases  the demand for the services of overseas studios has increased substantially 
this increased demand may lead overseas studios to raise their fees which may result in increased animated programming production costs or our inability to contract with our preferred overseas studios 
many of the subcontractors we use are located in south korea and  to a lesser extent  taiwan  the philippines and china 
each of these areas has recently experienced significant political and or economic turmoil  such as  but not limited to  devaluation of the won and other asian currencies 
the asian markets may continue to deteriorate  which could have a substantial impact on our ability to contract favorably with studios in asia 
these conditions could cause significant disruptions in the delivery of animation products to us 
in that event  we may be required to retain new subcontractors 
we cannot assure you that different subcontracting arrangements will be as favorable to us as our current arrangements 
international sales market fractionalization 
we derived approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  from licensing international distribution rights to our proprietary programming 
we anticipate that revenue from these activities will not grow substantially until we produce additional proprietary programming for which we own and control international distribution rights 
just as in the us  there are an increasing number of broadcast outlets for animation in most major international territories 
while this has created more opportunities to sell product  on the one hand  the total advertising dollars available is now being spread amongst this larger number of outlets  so the revenues each broadcaster receives and  consequently  the amount of the license fees they can pay  has begun to diminish substantially 
our ability to continue to expand our international business as well as our ability to contract upon favorable terms with overseas studios depends  in part  on the local economic conditions  currency fluctuations  local changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and cultural barriers 
in addition  political instability in a foreign nation may adversely affect our ability to distribute our product in that country 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our international operations will be profitable 
see business principal elements of the company s business distribution of proprietary programming international distribution 
risks associated with possible new businesses due in part to the recent changes in the television industry described in this report  we have made  and intend to continue to make a substantial commitment to new business areas beyond our core business of animation television production 
we have begun live action television production  feature film development with the expectation of production both live action and animation and direct to video production both live action and animation 
some of this production may be on a fee for services or a proprietary basis 
the television  feature film and direct to video industries are highly speculative and involve a substantial degree of risk 
the success of an individual television program  feature film or direct to video release depends upon unpredictable and changing factors  such as personal tastes of the public and critics 
in addition  we are evaluating entering the internet distribution market through the level branded animation destination 
this is a new business for us that may require that we use significant resources in an effort that may not be successful 
therefore  there is a substantial risk that our projects will not be successful  resulting in costs not being recouped and anticipated profits not being realized 
although we intend to limit the risks of production through co production  pre sale financing and or distribution arrangements  we will likely be unable to limit all of the financial risk of a television production  feature film or direct to video release 
in addition  because the success of a television production  feature film or direct to video release  and internet distribution depends upon consumer taste and critical response  as well as public awareness and the successful distribution of a production  we cannot predict the level of marketing  promotional and distribution activities and expenses necessary in any particular instance 
moreover  we have no history of developing  producing  or distributing live action television or film productions  or with exhibition over the internet and we cannot assure you that we can compete successfully with more established persons or entities 
live action production involves many of the risks associated with animation production that are described in this report  as well as additional risks inherent to live action that are outside of our control  including the risk of work stoppage or strike  increased union activity  delay in production due to weather and other local conditions  inability to obtain proper permitting to film at a desired site  at desired times and or under desired terms  and accidents or injury to actors and film crew 
we cannot be sure that we will produce any live action television or film projects or that  if produced  that such projects will be profitable 
the world wide web is an evolving marketplace  and we cannot predict consumer taste or the underlying technology 
likewise  we cannot assure you that we will be successful should we decide to promote level as an independent animation destination network 
technological changes  possible changes in production of our products the proliferation of new production technologies may change the manner in which we create and distribute programming 
recently  certain animators have begun to use computer generated animation  including three dimensional digital animation  instead of two dimensional cel animation  to create their animated programming 
we cannot be sure that the introduction and proliferation of three dimensional digital animation or other technological changes will not cause our historical methods of producing animation to become less cost competitive or less appealing to our audiences 
in addition  we cannot be sure that we will be able to adapt to such changes in a cost effective manner 
dependence upon key personnel our success depends to a significant extent upon the expertise and services of david pritchard  our president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
pritchard and or other key management personnel could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have employment agreements with mr 
pritchard and certain of our other key management personnel 
we do not currently carry key man life insurance policies on any of our executives 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our existing management personnel 
in addition  our continued success is highly dependent on the artistic and production capabilities of our creative staff 
we are a signatory to the screen actors guild collective bargaining agreement and certain of our voice over actors are screen actors guild members 
we also have a wholly owned subsidiary  namor productions inc  which is a signatory to the writer s guild of america collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel in both our existing and new businesses 
casualty risks substantially all of our operations and personnel are located in our north hollywood headquarters  resulting in vulnerability to fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure or other local conditions  including the risk of seismic activity 
if a disaster were to occur  our disaster recovery plans may not be adequate to protect the company and our business interruption insurance may not fully compensate us for our losses 
possible adverse effect of anti takeover provisions certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law including a stockholders rights plan sometimes referred to as a poison pill which we adopted in could be used by our incumbent management to make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company 
these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our corporate documents authorize the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to establish the rights of that preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if the board issues preferred stock  it could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company  even if a change in control were in our best interests 
volatility of stock price the market price of our common stock  which trades on the nasdaq national market  could fluctuate significantly in response to our operating results and other factors 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these fluctuations  as well as a shortfall in sales or earnings compared to public market analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  additions or departures of key personnel  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  and general economic and market conditions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we do not intend to pay dividends we have never paid dividends and currently do not intend to declare or pay dividends 
we plan to follow a policy of retaining earnings to finance the growth of our business 
whether or not we declare or pay dividends is up to our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations  financial condition  contractual and legal restrictions and other factors our board deems relevant at that time 
year issue risks may result in a material adverse effect on our business we are aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex 
virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to 
the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
we are reviewing both our information technology and our non information technology systems to determine whether they are year compliant  and to date we have not identified any material systems which are not year compliant 
we have not made any material expenditures to address the year problem and do not anticipate that we will be required to make any such material expenditure in the future 
we have contacted all of our significant suppliers and service providers to determine the extent to which we are vulnerable to their failure to address the year problem 
although we have received verbal assurances from some of these third parties that their systems are year compliant  we have not yet received written assurances from all of them 
although we do not believe our operations will be significantly disrupted even if third parties with whom we have relationships are not year compliant  we cannot guarantee you that any year compliance problems of these third parties will not negatively affect our financial performance 
because uncertainty exists concerning the potential costs and effects associated with any year compliance  we intend to continue to make efforts to ensure that third parties with whom we have relationships are year compliant
