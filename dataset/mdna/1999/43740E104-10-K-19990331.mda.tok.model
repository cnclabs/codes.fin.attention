general the company is headquartered in greenville  south carolina  and primarily engages in the business of originating  purchasing  selling  securitizing and servicing mortgage loan products to sub prime customers 
prior to the sale of the company s auto loan portfolio in march  the company also originated  securitized and serviced auto loans 
prior to the sale of substantially all of the assets of the small business loan unit in the fourth quarter of  the company made loans to small businesses primarily for the acquisition or refinancing of real estate or property  plant and equipment  working capital  and debt consolidation 
the company commenced its lending operations in through the acquisition of carolina investors  inc cii  a small mortgage lending company  which had been in operation since from the date of this acquisition through december   the company has experienced a compounded annual growth rate of in loan originations 
in  loan originations declined from the prior year 
there were two primary factors that resulted in lower production in compared to first was a decision at the beginning of to segregate the origination and the underwriting processes 
in connection with this reorganization  several managers of the homegold retail operations left the company 
second was a decision by the company to tighten underwriting guidelines in response to investor concerns related to the quality of loans that the company and its competitors were originating 
in  the company decided to focus primarily on the company s larger direct mail retail mortgage operation and its mortgage brokerage business 
this resulted in the sale of the small retail origination subsidiary  sterling lending corp 
slc in august in the fourth quarter of  the company began restructuring its mortgage loan retail product line distribution channel 
as a result of the restructuring and other factors  mortgage loan origination volumes declined each quarter in having assessed market conditions  management made strategic decisions to streamline retail mortgage lending operations 
retail lending operations located in indianapolis  indiana  phoenix  arizona  and houston  texas were consolidated in november into the greenville retail operating center located at the company headquarters in greenville  south carolina 
the impact of the above restructuring resulted in the elimination of positions or approximately of the company s work force 
the company incurred a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter as a result of this decision 
management feels these charges will be beneficial by creating efficiencies through consolidation of operations and implementation of future strategic directives  and better aligning expenses with current levels of production 
the company believes as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments on securitized loan pools and concerns in the market about the credit worthiness of several issuers of securitized assets  corporate interest rates spreads within the industry have widened significantly in the last half of the third quarter of these conditions have negatively impacted the securitization and whole loan sale markets 
as spreads widened  securitization as a means of financing has become less attractive 
as a result  more issuers are turning to the whole loan sale market 
as this whole loan product flows into the market  whole loan sale premiums have eroded  which has  in turn  adversely impacted issuer s profitability and created a liquidity crisis for the industry 
the company responded to the higher than anticipated prepayments on securitized loan pools by increasing the prepayment assumptions from cpr constant prepayment rate to cpr 
this decision resulted in a fair market value write down of million during the company also responded to the market liquidity concerns by making liquidity the company s primary objective in this decision resulted in a strategy in the last nine months in of selling all loans on a whole loan cash basis and not participating in any securitizations 
this decision also resulted in reducing the size of the loan portfolio 
the loan portfolio declined million or 
a part of the loan portfolio reduction resulted from the sale of the auto loan portfolio and the sale of the small business loan portfolio 
the sale of the auto loan portfolio resulted in the company receiving million while the sale of the small business loan portfolio resulted in the company receiving net cash proceeds of approximately million after repayment of warehouse lines of credit  required escrow funding  and payment of transaction costs 
the company s decision to reduce the loan portfolio size also allowed the company to use excess liquidity to repurchase million of its senior unsecured debt  and realize an extraordinary gain of million on the extinguishment of this debt 
the company may  from time to time  continue to acquire its senior debt 
in the first two months of  the company repurchased an additional million of senior debt  for a net gain of million 
as a result of higher customer loan prepayments than anticipated on both the portfolio and the securitized loan pools and the decision to reduce the loan portfolio by whole loan selling loans  the company s serviced mortgage loan portfolio declined from million at the end of to million at the end of the combination of the above factors resulted in the company having million of cash and overnight investments on hand at december  the company also had additional availability under its warehouse line of credit at the end of of million 
the company believes that its effort to closely monitor its liquidity position has allowed the company to weather the market turmoil in late while several competitors in the sub prime mortgage industry were forced out of business

included in the million net loss are several unusual items that included a million write down in the value of its residual receivables due to faster than anticipated prepayment speeds on its securitization pools  a million restructuring charge  a gain on sale of subsidiaries net assets of million  and an million gain on extinguishment of debt 
total revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the lower level of revenues resulted principally from lower than anticipated mortgage loan originations and decreases in gain on sale of loans 
the decrease in gain on sale of loans was partly offset by higher interest income and servicing income  and gain on sale of subsidiaries net assets 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income resulted primarily from a million or increase in average loan balance to million in from million in this increase was partly offset by a reduction in the average yield of basis points 
the yield in was compared to in the increase in the average loan balance resulted from a million increase in the company s mortgage loan portfolio  a million increase in the small business loan portfolio and a million reduction in the auto loan portfolio 
the increase in the average mortgage portfolio related primarily to growth in the portfolio in the first six months of in the third quarter of  the company began reducing the amount of mortgage loans held in its portfolio 
the reduction in the yield earned resulted from both a change in the mix of the company s total portfolio  more mortgage and small business and less auto  combined with lower mortgage and commercial rates 
weighted average mortgage rates declined basis points from in to in weighted average commercial rates declined basis points from in to in servicing income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due principally to the securitization of mortgage loans throughout and in the first quarter of  for which the company retained servicing rights 
prior to  all mortgage loans sold were sold servicing released  therefore the mortgage serviced portfolio was just beginning to grow during the average serviced mortgage loan portfolio increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross gain on sale of loans declined million  or  to million for this year ended december   from million for the year ended december  cash gain on sale of loans decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted principally from lower premiums and discounts on sales of mortgage loans 
the company believes the significant change in the premiums discounts received in resulted primarily from two factors 
first  the company sold at a discount substantially all of the second lien mortgage loans it held  that were not underwritten in accordance with company guidelines 
in an effort to increase loan production  former employees approved loans that did not meet company guidelines 
second  the company received significantly lower premiums on loan sales in the third and fourth quarters of because of a market surplus in the supply of loans in the resale market 
the company believes this surplus  in turn  resulted from the decision of issuers of securitized loan pools to sell their loan products in the whole loan cash market when securitization  as a means of financing  became less attractive 
securitization became less attractive as the corporate interest rate spreads required by investors increased in the latter half of investors required higher spreads because of concerns related to higher than anticipated prepayments on securitized loan pools and concerns about the credit worthiness of several issuers 
loans sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in loans sold resulted from the company s decision to increase its liquidity by reducing its loan portfolio 
the weighted average cash gain on sale of loans was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash gain on sale of loans decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in non cash gain on sale of loans was due principally to the company s decision not to do a mortgage securitization in the last three quarters of the company securitized million in loans for the year ended december  and recognized a weighted average non cash gain on sale as a percentage of loans securitized of  net of expenses 
the company securitized million in loans for the year ended december  and recognized a weighted average non cash gain on sale as a percentage of loans securitized of  net of expenses 
loan fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  loan fees received as a percentage of retail production for the year ended december  were as compared to for the year ended december  loan fees are deferred and recognized as interest income over the life of the loan 
all unamortized loan fees  net of origination costs  are realized as part of the gain on sale of loans when the loans are sold or securitized 
in  the company realized a net million gain on sale of subsidiaries net assets 
the company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its auto loan unit for book value on march  no significant gain or loss was recognized on this transaction 
on august   the company completed the sale of its small branch network retail mortgage origination unit  sterling lending corporation 
there was no significant gain or loss recorded as a result of this sale 
on november   the company sold the majority of the assets of its small business lending units 
the gain realized in was approximately million net of related costs 
on december   the company sold the majority of its asset based lending unit 
this transaction completed the disposition of all non mortgage related activities of the company 
the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of  other revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other revenues are comprised principally of insurance commissions  underwriting fees  late charges  warrant valuations  and management fees received in connection with the mezzanine lending operation 
the increase of other revenues resulted principally from the increased value of securities owned relating to the commercial mezzanine lending operation in the amount of approximately  and higher underwriting fees and late charge fees received in total expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  total expenses are comprised of interest expense  provision for credit losses  fair value write down of residual receivables  salaries  wages and employee benefits  business development costs  and other general and administrative expenses 
the increased expenses are due largely to the company s increased mortgage loan retail origination operations during with the opening of the greenville office in the first quarter and the opening of the houston office in the fourth quarter 
however  management has reduced general and administrative expenses during from an average of million per month in the first quarter of  to million per month in the second quarter of  to in the third quarter of  and to in the fourth quarter of excluding million restructuring charge 
management anticipates that in the first quarter of general and administrative expenses will be lower than the fourth quarter  mainly as a result of personnel reductions and the restructuring initiated in november first quarter general and administrative expenses are anticipated to average approximately million per month 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was due principally to additional borrowings associated with the increase in the company s average mortgage and small business loan portfolio  the offering of the company s senior notes due senior notes in september  and the higher borrowing levels that were required to fund the company s operating loss in for the year ended december  and  the company incurred interest expense of approximately million and million  respectively related to the senior notes 
provision for credit losses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in the provision was made to maintain the general reserves for credit losses associated with loans held for investment  as well as to increase specific reserves for possible losses with regard to particular loans  including delinquent loans purchased out of the mortgage securitizations  which totaled million for the year ended december  as the result of higher than anticipated prepayments in  the company modified the estimated prepayment speeds on all of its mortgage loan securitization transactions to peak at constant prepayment rate cpr up from the previous prepayment speeds of cpr 
this resulted in a write down of residual receivables of million in no such write down was necessary in in november  the company decided to close three retail loan origination centers and to consolidate all operations into one location 
this decision resulted in a restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring charge related to the write down of fixed assets to net realizable value on assets no longer used by the company was million  the estimated costs of employee relocation costs and employee severance was approximately million  and the estimated net lease cost on facilities no longer being used was million 
total general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this resulted primarily because salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million  or  to million in  from million in  and business development costs increased million to million in from million in the increased personnel costs resulted from the expansion of the mortgage retail product distribution channels in and early in the portfolio management  underwriting  processing  and closing departments  and the increased expenses associated with the opening of retail regional operating centers in greenville first quarter of and houston fourth quarter of 
the higher business development costs also related to the retail lending expansion 
the higher general and administrative expenses were also the result of expenditures associated with an anticipated higher level of production volume planned for in  which did not occur 
the company has recorded current income tax expense of million for the year ended december   even though overall the company generated a pre tax loss for the year ended december  the company has not recorded a deferred tax benefit related to the current loss due to management s assessment of the recoverability of the related deferred tax asset 
the current tax is due on income called excess inclusion income 
excess inclusion income is a result of the company securitizing loans in pools to third party investors 
these transactions generate income for the company that is included in the overall loss 
however  according to irs regulations  a portion of that income is subject to federal tax in the current period regardless of other current period losses or nol carryovers otherwise available to offset regular taxable income 
the excess inclusion income approximates the net interest the company receives on the loans in the pools after the bondholders are paid their share of the interest less the sum of the daily accruals  an amount allowed for tax purposes as a reasonable economic return on the retained ownership interest

with respect to loans to be sold on a non recourse basis  the company is at risk for loan delinquencies and defaults on such loans while they are held by the company pending such sale 
to provide for credit losses  the company charges against current earnings an amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at levels expected to cover inherent losses in loans receivable 
the table below summarizes certain information with respect to the company s allowance for credit losses on the owned portfolio for each of the periods indicated 
summary of allowance for credit losses on owned portfolio at and for the year ended december  in thousands allowance for credit losses at beginning of    period net charge offs    provision charged to expense    write down of allowance due to sale of receivables    allowance for credit losses at the end of the period    the company considers its allowance for credit losses to be adequate in view of the company s loss experience and the secured nature of most of the company s outstanding loans 
although management considers the allowance appropriate and adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about future events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for credit losses or that additional increases in the allowance for possible credit losses will not be required

average serviced loans have been determined by using beginning and ending balances for the period presented except that the and averages are calculated based on the daily averages for small business loans and auto loans and monthly averages for the mortgage loans rather than the beginning and ending balances 
management closely monitors delinquencies to measure the quality of its loan portfolio and securitized loans and the potential for credit losses 
accrual of interest is discontinued and reversed when a loan is either over days past due  the collateral is determined to be inadequate  or when foreclosure proceedings begin 
collection efforts on charged off loans continue until the obligation is satisfied or until it is determined that such obligation is not collectible or the cost of continued collection efforts would exceed the potential recovery 
recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance for credit losses 
management monitors securitized pool delinquencies using a static pool analysis by month by pool balance 
since these pools are new  it is anticipated that the delinquencies will ramp up during the first one to two years 
current year results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
the following sets forth the static pool analysis for delinquencies by month in the company s securitized mortgage loan pools 
current principal balance months from pool inception delinquencies days past due months from pool inception included in the principal balances and delinquency amounts is million of real estate acquired through foreclosure 
delinquencies days past due as a percent of current balance months from pool average inception actual historical life to date prepayment speed liquidity and capital resources the company s business requires continued access to short and long term sources of debt financing and equity capital 
as a result of selling its loans for cash in the whole loan market and as a result of selling more loans in than were originated in  the company experienced a positive cash flow from operating activities in although the company s goal is to achieve a positive cash flow each quarter  no assurance can be given that this objective will be obtained due to the higher level of cash required to fund the loans purchased and originated 
currently  the company s primary operating cash uses include the funding of i loan originations and purchases pending their securitization or sale  ii interest expense on cii investor savings notes cii notes  senior unsecured debt and its revolving warehouse credit facilities credit facilities  iii fees  expenses  overcollateralization and tax payments incurred in connection with the securitization program and iv ongoing administrative and other operating expenses 
the company s primary operating sources of cash are i cash gains from whole loan mortgage loan sales  ii cash payments of contractual and ancillary servicing revenues received by the company in its capacity as servicer for securitized loans  iii interest income on loans receivable and certain cash balances  iv fee income received in connection with its retail mortgage loan originations  and v excess cash flow received in each period with respect to residual receivables 
while the company believes that such sources of funds will be adequate to meet its liquidity requirements  no assurance of such fact may be given 
the company overcollateralizes loans as a credit enhancement on the mortgage securitization transactions 
this requirement creates negative cash flows in the year of securitization 
the company determined in the second quarter of to conduct whole loan sales for the remainder of the year so as to improve liquidity 
accordingly  the company did not securitize any mortgage loans in the last three quarters of cash flow is also enhanced by the generation of loan fees in its retail mortgage loan operation and the utilization of a wholesale loan origination strategy whereby loans are generally funded at par  rather than at the significant premiums typically associated with a correspondent based strategy 
however  in  the company began paying  on a limited basis  some yield spread premiums as a way to increase its wholesale production

the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due principally to a million net reduction on warehouse lines of credit 
at december   the company had a million warehouse line of credit with cit group business credit  inc cit to fund its mortgage loan originations 
based on the borrowing base limitations contained in the credit facility  at december   the company had aggregate outstanding borrowings of million and aggregate borrowing availability of million 
the credit facility bears interest at prime 
the credit facility matures on june  the credit facility contains certain covenants  including  but not limited to  covenants that impose limitations on the company and its subsidiaries with respect to declaring or paying dividends and minimum cii notes outstanding and loans and advances by hgi and cii to the company 
the company believes that it is currently in compliance with the loan covenants 
during  the company sold million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes due constitute unsecured indebtedness of the company 
the senior notes due are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after september   at predetermined redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
this agreement requires  among other matters  restrictions on the payment of dividends 
at december   management believes the company was in compliance with such restrictive covenants 
the senior notes due are fully and unconditionally guaranteed the subsidiary guarantees jointly and severally on an unsecured basis each  a guarantee by certain of the company s subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors 
with the exception of the guarantee by cii  the subsidiary guarantees rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantors and senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of such guarantors 
the guarantee by cii is equal in priority to cii s notes payable to investors and is senior to cii s subordinated debentures 
the company purchased million face amount of its senior notes in and million in the first two months of at december   million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes were outstanding 
at february   million was outstanding 
cii engages in the sale of cii notes to investors 
the cii notes are comprised of senior notes and subordinated debentures bearing fixed rates of interest which are sold by cii only to south carolina residents 
the offering of the cii notes is registered under south carolina securities law and is believed to be exempt from federal registration under the federal intrastate exemption 
cii believes it conducts its operations so as to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of rule promulgated pursuant to the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
at december   cii had an aggregate of million of investor notes outstanding bearing a weighted average interest rate of  and an aggregate of million of subordinated debentures bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
the investor notes and subordinated debentures are subordinate in priority to the credit facility 
substantially all of the cii notes and debentures have one year maturities 
shareholders equity decreased in by million to million at december   from million at december  during  stockholders equity increased million to million at december   from million at december  the decrease in relates primarily to the losses incurred for the year  while the increase in resulted principally from the retention of income by the company and the issuance of  additional shares of common stock at a value of million related to the acquisition of the remaining of reedy river ventures lp that the company did not already own 
the company s primary objective in will be to insure adequate levels of liquidity as the company strives to increase loan originations 
the company anticipates incurring operating losses in the company plans to continue to reduce the loan portfolio through either whole loan sale or through securitizations 
these sales will generate additional cash that can be used to fund operating losses  to fund declines in investor notes that could occur  or purchase additional subordinated debt  reducing interest expense 
the company plans to operate more like a mortgage banker that originates and sells loans  retaining only a small portfolio of loans until such time that the company s operations support the levels of cash flow to justify rebuilding a portfolio of loans 
combining the company s present level of liquidity  with its borrowing availability under the warehouse line of credit  and the company s plans to further reduce both the senior subordinated debt and loan portfolio  management believes these strategies will provide adequate cash flow to support the operating plan 
the company continually evaluates the need to establish other sources of capital and will pursue those it considers appropriate based upon its need and market conditions 
the company currently does not anticipate incurring any significant capital expenditures in loan sales and securitizations the company sells or securitizes substantially all of its loans 
the company sells on a whole loan basis a significant amount of its mortgage loans servicing released  including substantially all of its mortgage loans secured by second liens  principally to secure the additional cash flow associated with the premiums paid in connection with such sales and to eliminate the credit risk associated with the second lien mortgage loans 
however  no assurance can be given that the second mortgage loans can be sold 
to the extent that the loans are not sold  the company retains the risk of loss 
at december  and  the company had retained and million  respectively  of second mortgage loans on its balance sheet 
during   and  the company sold million  million  and million  respectively  of mortgage loans and  million  and million  respectively  of the guaranteed portions of sba loans 
on a quarterly basis in  the company securitized substantial amounts of its mortgage loans  totaling million 
in the first quarter of  the company securitized million of mortgage loans 
although securitizations provide liquidity  the company has utilized securitizations principally to provide a lower cost of funds and reduce interest rate risk  while building servicing revenues by increasing the serviced portfolio 
in connection with its securitizations  the company has retained interest only residual certificates representing residual interests in the trusts 
these subordinate residual securities totaled million  net of allowances  at december  a new securitization structure was completed for the fourth quarter mortgage loan securitization 
this structure utilizes a real estate investment trust reit and allows sales treatment for financial reporting purposes  but debt treatment for tax purposes 
accordingly  this structure eliminates current taxes payable on the book gain  while maintaining the structural efficiency of tranching  previously only available through a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic transaction 
additionally  under this structure  the company has distributed 
ownership in the reit to a certain class of employees  with an initial value of approximately  in  the company began securitizing mortgage loans 
under this method  the company sells mortgage loans it purchased or originated to a trust for cash 
the trust sells asset backed bonds secured by the loans to investors 
the company records certain assets and income based upon the difference between all principal and interest received from the loans sold and the following factors i all principal and interest required to be passed through to the asset backed bond investors  ii all excess contractual servicing fees  iii other recurring fees and iv an estimate of losses on the loans collectively  the excess cash flow 
at the time of the securitization  the company estimates these amounts based upon a declining principal balance of the underlying loans  adjusted by an estimated prepayment and loss rate  and capitalizes these amounts using a discount rate that market participants would use for similar financial instruments 
these capitalized assets are recorded as a residual receivable 
the company believes the assumptions it has used in past securitizations are appropriate and reasonable 
the company retains the right to service loans it securitizes 
fees for servicing loans are based on a stipulated percentage generally per annum of the unpaid principal balance of the associated loans 
on its mortgage loan securitizations  the company has recognized a servicing asset in addition to its gain on sale of loans 
the servicing asset is calculated as the present value of the expected future net servicing income in excess of adequate compensation for a substitute servicer  based on common industry assumptions and the company s historical experience 
these factors include default and prepayment speeds 
for the five mortgage securitizations completed to date  the servicing asset recorded represents a basis point strip of cash flows from the stipulated servicing percentage 
the following sets forth facts and assumptions used by the company in arriving at the valuation of the residual receivables relating to its mortgage loan securitizations at december  outstanding balance of loans      securitized average stated principal balance      weighted average coupon on loans weighted average remaining term to mths mths mths mths mths stated maturity weighted average ltv of first mortgage loans weighted average pass through rate to bondholders assumed annual losses ramp period for losses mths mths mths mths mths assumed cumulative losses as a of upb annual servicing fee servicing asset discount rate applied to cash flow after overcollateralization prepayment speed initial cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr peak cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr tail cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr ramp period mths mths mths mths mths cpr peak period mths mths mths mths mths cpr tail begins mths mths mths mths mths annual wrap fee and trustee fee initial overcollateralization required final overcollateralization required cpr represents an industry standard of calculating prepayment speeds and refers to constant prepayment rate 
the company uses a curve based on various cpr levels throughout the pool s life  based on its estimate of prepayment performance  as outlined in the table above 
based on percentage of original principal balance  subject to step down provisions after months 
each of the company s mortgage loan securitizations have been credit enhanced by an insurance policy provided through a monoline insurance company such that the senior certificates have received ratings of aaa from moody s investors services  inc moody s and aaa from standard poor s ratings group  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc standard poor s 
the company expects to begin receiving excess cash flow on its mortgage loan securitizations approximately months from the date of securitization  although this time period may be shorter or longer depending upon the securitization structure and performance of the loans securitized 
prior to such time  the monoline insurer requires a reserve provision to be created within the securitization trust which uses excess cash flow to retire the securitization bond debt until the spread between the outstanding principal balance of the loans in the securitization trust and the securitization bond debt equals a specified percentage depending on the structure of the securitization of the initial securitization principal balance the overcollateralization limit 
once this overcollateralization limit is met  excess cash flows are distributed to the company 
the company begins to receive regular monthly servicing fees in the month following securitization 
the gains recognized into income resulting from securitization transactions vary depending on the assumptions used  the specific characteristics of the underlying loan pools  and the structure of the transaction 
the company believes the assumptions it has used are appropriate and reasonable 
the company assesses the carrying value of its residual receivables and servicing assets for impairment 
there can be no assurance that the company s estimates used to determine the gain on sale of loans  residual receivables  and servicing assets valuations will remain appropriate for the life of each securitization 
if actual loan prepayments or defaults exceed the company s estimates  the carrying value of the company s residual receivables and or servicing assets may be decreased through a charge against earnings in the period management recognizes the disparity 
conversely  if actual loan prepayments or defaults are better than the company s estimates  the carrying value of the company s residual receivables and or servicing assets may be increased  with additional earnings recognized in the period management recognizes the disparity 
at december  key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate percent and percent adverse changes in assumed economics is as follows dollars in thousands 
loans carrying amount fair value of retained interests  weighted average life in years prepayment speed assumption annual rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change  expected credit losses annual rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change residual cash flows discount rate annual impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change  these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution 
as the figures indicate  any change in fair value based on a percent variation in assumptions cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value is not linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated independent from any change in another assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
tax considerations as a result of operating losses incurred by the company  the company has net operating losses nol that can be used to offset future earnings 
federal tax laws provide that net operating loss carryforwards are restricted or eliminated upon certain changes of control 
applicable federal tax laws provide that a change of control  which is calculated over a rolling three year period  would cause the loss of substantially all of the nol 
the company believes its maximum cumulative change of control during the relevant three year period was less than 
during  the company established a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax asset  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million at december  management based the decision to record the valuation allowance based on the significant operating losses incurred during the amount of the reserves was established such that the amount of deferred tax assets on the books remained constant to the level at december  the amount of the remaining deferred tax asset is deemed appropriate by management based on its belief that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of this deferred tax asset  given the levels of historical taxable income and current projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets would be realized 
the company had a federal nol of approximately million at december  hedging activities the company s profitability may be directly affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
while the company monitors interest rates it may  from time to time  employ a strategy designed to hedge some of the risks associated with changes in interest rates  no assurance can be given that the company s results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected during periods of fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s interest rate hedging strategy includes shorting interest rate futures and treasury forwards  and entering into interest rate lock agreements 
since the interest rates on the company s warehouse line of credit used to fund and acquire loans is variable and the rates charged on loans the company originates are fixed  increases in the interest rates after loans are originated and prior to their sale could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the ultimate sale of the company s loans generally will fix the spread between the interest rates paid by borrowers and the interest rates paid to investors in securitization transactions with respect to such loans  although increases in interest rates may narrow the potential spread that existed at the time the loans were originated by the company 
without hedging these loans  increases in interest rates prior to sale of the loans may reduce the gain on sale or securitization of loans earned by the company 
accounting considerations in june  financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company has not assessed the impact of this standard 
in october  fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise which is effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  this statement conforms the subsequent accounting for securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans by a mortgage banking enterprise with the subsequent accounting for securities retained after the securitization of other types of assets by a nonmortgage banking enterprise 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation affects the company most significantly in the area of loan originations and can have a substantial effect on interest rates 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
profitability may be directly affected by the level and fluctuation in interest rates which affect the company s ability to earn a spread between interest received on its loans and the costs of its borrowings 
the profitability of the company is likely to be adversely affected during any period of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates 
a substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the ability of the company to originate and purchase loans and affect the mix of first and second lien mortgage loan products 
generally  first lien mortgage production increases relative to second lien mortgage production in response to low interest rates and second lien mortgage production increases relative to first lien mortgage production during periods of high interest rates 
a significant decline in interest rates could decrease the size of the company s loan servicing portfolio by increasing the level of loan prepayments 
additionally  to the extent servicing rights and residual receivables have been capitalized on the books of the company  higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments or losses could require the company to write down the value of such servicing rights and residual receivables  adversely impacting earnings 
fluctuating interest rates may also affect the net interest income earned by the company resulting from the difference between the yield to the company on loans held pending sales and the interest paid by the company for funds borrowed under the company s warehouse line of credit 
year general description of the year issue and the nature and effects of the year on information technology it and non it systems the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send statements  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on recent assessments  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications or replacements of existing software and certain hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date  the company has fully completed its assessment of all systems that could be significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems were year compliant  but this assessment has identified some portions which require remediation or upgrades 
for its information technology exposures  to date the company is complete on the remediation phase and complete on the testing and implementation phases 
the company expects to complete these phases no later than april  accordingly  the company does not believe that the year presents a material exposure 
in addition  the company has gathered information about the year compliance status of its significant suppliers and subcontractors and continues to monitor their compliance 
nature and level of importance of third parties and their exposure to the year the company has queried its significant suppliers and subcontractors in writing 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
costs the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
to date  the company has incurred approximately   expensed and  capitalized for new systems and equipment  related to all phases of the year project 
of the total remaining project costs  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of software and upgrades  which will be expensed as incurred 
risks management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases  the company would temporarily be unable to engage in normal business activities on and after january  in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
contingency plan the company has contingency plans for certain critical applications and is working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  and adjusting staffing strategies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market price and interest rates 
this risk of loss can be reflected in diminished current market values and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  its holding of residual receivables and its investor savings activities 
the structure of the company s loan and investor savings portfolios is such that a significant rise or decline in interest rates may adversely impact net market values and net interest income 
the company does not maintain a trading account nor is the company subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
responsibility for monitoring interest rate risk rests with senior management 
senior management regularly reviews the company s interest rate risk position and adopts balance sheet strategies that are intended to optimize operating earnings while maintaining market risk within acceptable guidelines 
to estimate the impact that changes in interest rates would have on the company s earnings  management uses simulation analysis 
simulation analysis is performed using a computer based asset liability model which incorporates current portfolio balances and rates  contractual maturities  repricing opportunities and assumptions about prepayments  future interest rates and future volumes 
to measure the sensitivity of the company s earnings  the result of multiple simulations  which assume changes in interest rates  are compared to the base case simulation  which assumes no changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity of earnings is expressed as a percentage change in comparison to the base case simulation 
the model assumes an immediate parallel shift in interest rates 
the company s interest rate risk position based on simulation results as of december  is as follows basis point change in interest rates projected percentage change in net income while the company monitors interest rates and may  from time to time  employ a strategy designed to hedge some of the risks associated with changes in interest rates  no assurance can be given that the company s results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected during periods of fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december   the company did not hedge its loans held for whole loan sales 
the company s present strategy is to sell the substantial portion of the current month s production that is designated for whole loan sales in the following month and the remaining loans in the subsequent month 
because the interest rates on the company s warehouse lines of credit used to fund and acquire loans are variable and the rates charged on loans the company originates are fixed  increases in the interest rates after loans are originated and prior to their sale may reduce the gain on loan sales earned by the company 
there were no open hedging positions at year end 
on loans originated for inclusion in securitized pools  the company generally employs a strategy designed to hedge some of the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
the company s interest rate hedging strategy  includes shorting interest rate futures and treasury forwards  and entering into interest rate lock agreements relating to loans pending a securitization transaction 
the ultimate sale of the company s loans included in a securitized transaction generally will fix the spread between the interest rates paid by borrowers and the interest rates paid to investors in securitization transactions with respect to such loans  although increases in interest rates may narrow the potential spread that existed at the time the loans were originated by the company 
however  a significant reduction in market rates could accelerate the prepayment speed on loans held in the various securitized mortgage pools 
an acceleration of prepayment on loans held in the securitized pools would have a negative impact on the carry value of the residual assets 
there were no open hedging positions at year end 
projected percentage changes in operating results brought about by changes in interest rates could be material relative to the company s operating results 
if simulation results indicate earnings sensitivity in excess of management s acceptable limits  management will seek to identify on balance sheet and or off balance sheet strategies to bring earnings sensitivity within target guidelines 
management will continue to monitor the company s interest rate risk position to manage the possible adverse impact on earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
