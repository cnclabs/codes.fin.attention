the company derives revenue primarily from the sale of vacation credits and  to a lesser extent  from financing of vacation credits and from management fees generated from its management agreement with worldmark 
vacation credit sales and upgrade sales are recognized on the accrual basis after the company has received an executed sales contract and a minimum down payment  and the rescission period generally three to seven days has passed 
in instances where the company finances an upgrade sale and the customer does not make an additional cash down payment of at least of the upgrade sale  the company uses the installment method to recognize revenue 
under the installment method  gross profit on such upgrade sale is deferred and thereafter recognized in relation to each principal payment received 
revenue is fully recognized on the upgrade sale when the principal collected related to the upgrade sale totals of the amount of the upgrade sale 
commencing in the first quarter of  the company modified its upgrade sales marketing practices so as to encourage an additional cash down payment of at least of the upgrade sale amount 
in  of upgrade sales had the additional cash down payment  as compared to in the company acquires or develops additional resort units for worldmark and contributes those units to worldmark free of monetary encumbrances  thereby creating additional vacation credits for sale by the company 
the company assigns each worldmark resort unit a specific number of vacation credits based on its vacation use value relative to existing worldmark resort units 
acquisition and construction costs associated with the worldmark resort units are recorded as inventory

financing of vacation credits is provided to owners by trendwest at an interest rate of or per annum for a term of up to seven years 
the company routinely sells notes receivable to financial institutions and other investors to generate liquidity to acquire or develop new resort units and for working capital 
the company recognizes a gain on the sale of notes receivable at the time of sale equal to the excess of the proceeds received cash plus residual interest in notes receivable sold over the allocated carrying value of the notes receivable sold 
residual interest in notes receivable sold represents the present value of the estimated net future cash flows of the payment streams  resulting from the sale of notes receivable  and is carried at fair value with the changes in fair value included in finance income

the company continually needs to acquire and develop additional resort units for worldmark in order to provide additional vacation credits for sale by the company and to provide a greater variety of resort location for owners 
the continued growth of the company and increase in the owner base allows for the development of larger resorts which provides certain economies of scale to the company and to worldmark from an operating cost standpoint 
the permitting process for larger resorts can be lengthy at times  particularly in california and necessitates the need to acquire land as much to months before a resort is completed 
this is reflected in the company s investment in inventory which remained comparable at and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   there were million credits available for sale 
with the completion of current projects in progress  the expansion of existing resorts and completion of the permitting process for maui  the company believes it will have an adequate supply of credits available to meet its planned growth through the early part of the year since all vacation credits have the same use rights and the same listed selling price  the company does not experience a buildup of inventory of less desirable resort units or interval dates which are difficult to sell 
since completed units at various resort properties are acquired or developed in advance and a significant portion of the purchase price of vacation credits is financed by the company  the company continually needs funds to acquire and develop property  to carry notes receivable contracts and to provide working capital 
the company has historically secured additional funds through loans from the parent and the sale of notes receivable through the finance subsidiaries

year the year issue is a flaw in many electronic data processing systems which prevents them from processing year date data accurately beyond the year this is the result of using a two digit representation for the year  for example for 
this approach assumed that the first two digits of the abbreviated date is 
however  when the computer reaches it may interpret as the year possibly causing inaccurate data processing or processing to stop altogether 
the company is addressing the year issue with a corporate wide initiative led by the director of information systems and involving the vice president of administration and the chief operating officer 
the initiative includes the identification of affected software  the development of a plan for correcting the software in the most effective manner  the implementation of that plan and the monitoring of that implementation 
the program also includes communications with the company s significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s systems are vulnerable to any failures by them to address the year issue 
in most instances  the company will renovate existing code applications  replace older software with new programs and systems  which will significantly upgrade the existing software as well as appropriately interpret the calendar year and beyond 
although the timing of these replacements is influenced by the year issue  in most instances they will involve capital expenditures that would have occurred in the normal course of business 
the company has analyzed each line of code within critical applications and has determined how any year issues will be addressed 
the reservation system was the first system for remediation as reservations are accepted months in advance 
code revisions have been completed  tested and released to the live reservations application on september   one month ahead of schedule 
subsequent use of the revised reservation system indicates it is accepting reservations in the year as designed 
other critical applications such as dues  contracts  collections and sales are currently scheduled for completion of remediation by april  these applications will be put into the live environment by june  the marketing system is another critical application which is currently being re written and upgraded to improve its features and for year compliance 
the marketing system is scheduled for implementation on june  as a contingency plan in the event the re written code is not ready on june   the company is remediating the old marketing system code at the same time 
non critical applications are scheduled for completion by october  the company is currently on track with its implementation schedule and is in the process of developing a contingency plan in case the remediation is not completed 
the company is also monitoring the year compliance program of sage systems  inc sage  the servicer of the company s notes receivable portfolio 
sage has represented that its year remediation is complete 
the company currently is reviewing each line of sage s code to verify their year compliance 
the company has incurred approximately 
million to date to modify or replace software in order to remediate the year issue and anticipates future expenditures of approximately 
million 
in the worst case  if the remediation is not completed in time  management will employ additional personnel and use pc based applications to maintain critical functions 
based on its current assessments and remediation plans  the company does not expect that it will suffer any material disruption of its business as a result of the year issue 
if the company s remediations were to fail  it would implement its contingency plan 
in such an event  it is likely that there would be temporary disruption of customer service and customer inconvenience and additional costs from the implementation of the contingency plan 
it is not possible to quantify those costs at the present time 
although the company believes its contingency plan  when completed  will satisfactorily address these issues  there can be no assurance that the company s contingency plan will function as anticipated or that the results of operations of the company will not be adversely affected 
the above statement and other statements herein contain forward looking information which include future financing transactions  acquisition of properties  and the company s future prospects and other forecasts and statements of expectations 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by the company  due among other things  to the company s ability to develop or acquire additional resort properties  find acceptable debt or equity capital to fund such development  as well as other risk factors as outlined in the risk factors section of this form k
