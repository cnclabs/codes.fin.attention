fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results  both on an annual and a quarterly basis  are affected by many factors  including the timing of large orders from customers  the timing of expenditures to purchase inventory in anticipation of future sales  the company s ability to obtain inventory on consignment on acceptable terms  the mix of available aircraft spare parts contained at any time in the company s inventory  the timing of aircraft or engine sales or leases  unanticipated aircraft or engine lease terminations  default by any lessees and many other factors largely outside the company s control 
since the company typically does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from its customers  it must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of its customers and discussions with customers as to their future requirements 
cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by a customer or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  due to the value of a single aircraft or engine sale relative to the value of parts typically sold by the company  any concentration of aircraft or engine sales in a particular quarter may obscure existing or developing trends in the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
