on july   the company acquired freeman for million  which was financed through short term borrowings supported by the company s long term credit agreement 
the freeman acquisition added million to current assets  million to current liabilities and million to goodwill

the company s average income before income taxes over the past three years was approximately million 
year compliance overview many existing computer systems and software products  including several used by the company  are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  the company s date critical functions related to the year and beyond  such as sales  distribution  manufacturing  purchasing  inventory control  trade promotion management  planning and replenishment  facilities and financial systems may be materially adversely affected unless computer systems and embedded microchips in manufacturing equipment are or become year compliant 
in addition  certain of the company s business activities may be materially adversely affected if critical business partners  including customers  vendors  suppliers  brokers and others  experience disruptions in service as a result of year problems 
the company currently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely with respect to year problems that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially adversely impact the company s results of operations or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors  suppliers  brokers or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse impact on the company s systems or results of operations 
the company continues to implement changes that it believes are necessary to assure accurate date recognition and data processing with respect to the year activities have been organized into four specific areas information technology applications  information technology infrastructure  embedded systems and business partners 
information technology applications the company s year efforts include identifying information technology applications such as payroll and order entry requiring remediation  assessing what is required to remediate those applications  remediating them to be ready for the year by either modifying or replacing them and testing them for year readiness 
the company has completed the identification and assessment of the application systems that it believes are critical to maintaining operations 
these systems are in the process of being replaced or upgraded to year compliant versions 
the company currently believes that these efforts will be completed by mid the various projects that are underway currently are meeting their respective milestone dates for completion 
information technology infrastructure the company also is following the approach described above for its information technology infrastructure 
this includes the computer and communications hardware and related operating system software on which the information systems applications are operated 
this equipment is in the process of being replaced or upgraded to year compliant versions 
the company believes that these efforts will be completed by mid the various projects that are underway currently are meeting their respective milestone dates for completion 
embedded systems the company is also following the same approach as described above for its embedded systems 
these embedded systems include  among other things  manufacturing equipment with embedded microchips that may fail as a result of year date problems 
the company has identified and completed an assessment of the embedded systems it believes are critical  and currently believes that such systems will be remediated and tested by mid business partners the company is communicating with its critical business partners customers  vendors  suppliers  brokers and others to assess their readiness and to consider the potential impact on the company if these business partners experience significant year problems 
the company has identified those entities that it believes are critical to its operations  and is assessing and attempting to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of these entities to be year compliant by developing a contingency plan 
the company has assessed  and currently is assessing  its risk in this area 
the company currently plans to complete its work in this area by april and also plans to continue monitoring certain business partners after that date for year issues 
contingency plan a contingency plan is being developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  and the company believes that its contingency plan will be finalized by mid the company currently believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for the company involves the failure to timely complete the replacement or upgrade of critical information systems applications combined with the failure of embedded microchip technology at the company s manufacturing facilities and the failure of critical business partners to be year compliant 
the company currently believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would result in increased costs due to remediation efforts and additional staffing to support business activities  as well as difficulties in procuring raw materials and meeting customer demand for the company s products  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations 
costs the company is using both internal and external resources to meet the timetable established for completion of its year efforts 
the company incurred costs of million in and currently is expected to incur costs of million in in addition  the company incurred costs of million in and is currently expected to incur costs of million in in capital for the upgrade of its information technology systems 
these expenditures will address year compliance and are expected to provide the company with improved efficiencies and cost savings 
the costs of the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts and the dates on which the company believes it will complete such efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to identify  assess  remediate and test all relevant computer codes and embedded technology and similar uncertainties 
in addition  variability of definitions of compliance with year and the myriad different products and services  and combinations thereof  sold by the company may lead to claims having an impact on the company which is not currently estimable 
no assurance can be given that the aggregate cost of defending and resolving such claims  if any  will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
although some of the company s agreements with manufacturers and others from whom it purchases products for resale contain provisions requiring such parties to indemnify the company under some circumstances  there can be no assurance that such indemnification arrangements will cover all the company s liabilities and costs related to claims by third parties related to the year issue 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future results and financial condition are dependent upon the company s ability to successfully develop  manufacture and market consumer products 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
intense competition in the consumer products industry the consumer products industry  particularly its detergent  personal care and air freshener categories  is intensely competitive 
among the company s most significant competitors are large companies  including p g  lever and colgate 
these companies have greater financial resources than the company and may be willing to commit significant resources to protecting their own market shares or to capturing market share from the company 
as a result  the company may need to incur greater costs than previously incurred for trade and consumer promotions and advertising to preserve or improve market share and to introduce and establish new products and line extensions 
at the same time  the company may need to undertake additional production related cost cutting measures to enable it to respond to competitors price cuts and marketing efforts without reducing the company s margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to make such additional expenditures or implement such cost cutting measures or that  if made or implemented  they will be effective 
consumer pricing pressures consumer products  particularly those that are value priced  are subject to significant price competition 
from time to time  the company may need to engage in price cutting initiatives for some of its products to respond to competitive and consumer pressures 
the failure of the company s sales volumes to grow sufficiently to improve overall revenues and income as a result of a competitive price reduction could have a material adverse effect on the financial performance of the company 
trade customer pricing pressures  competitive retail environment the company faces pricing pressures from its trade customers 
because of the competitive retail environment  retailers have increasingly sought to reduce inventory levels and obtain pricing concessions from vendors 
in addition  because consumer products companies  including the company  have historically offered end of quarter discounts to achieve quarterly sales goals  trade customers have been inclined to delay inventory restocking until quarter end 
over the past two years  the company has reduced end of quarter discounts to retailers and has changed its sales incentive structure to emphasize not only quarterly revenue targets but also trade spending management and other personal performance targets 
the reduction in discounts has not had  and the company believes it will not have  a material adverse effect on sales  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company also is subject to the risk that high volume customers could seek alternative pricing concessions or better trade terms 
the company s performance also is dependent upon the general health of the retail environment and could be materially adversely affected by changes therein and by the financial difficulties of retailers 
dependence on key customers the company s top customers accounted for of net sales in wal mart was the company s largest customer  accounting for of the company s net sales in the loss of  or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by  wal mart or any of the company s other top customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
price volatility of raw materials  single source supplier while the company believes that it may  in certain circumstances  be able to respond to price increases for certain raw materials by increasing sales prices  rapid increases in the prices of such raw materials could have a material adverse impact on financial results 
for example  tallow a key ingredient in dial bar soaps has experienced price fluctuations within the range of and per pound from january   to december  recently  the price of tallow has been trading near the lower end of this historical range 
because the majority of the competitors soap products use considerably less tallow in their bar soap products  the company may not be able to increase the prices of its dial bar soaps in response to increases in tallow prices 
in addition  the antibacterial agent  triclosan  which is the active ingredient used in liquid dial products  is sourced from a single supplier 
although the company has an adequate supply of triclosan for its current and foreseeable needs  a significant disruption in this supply could have a short term material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
although the company seeks to enter into contracts to provide up to six month supplies of tallow  triclosan and packaging materials  long term hedging opportunities against price increases for these items are generally not available 
dependence on domestic markets  risks associated with international expansion while a number of the company s competitors have diversified their revenues to include a strong international component  the company is currently dependent primarily on sales generated in the us of sales in 
with respect to a number of the company s most significant product categories  including detergents and bar soaps  the us markets are mature and characterized by high household penetration 
the company s unit sales growth in these domestic markets will depend on increasing usage by consumers and capturing market share from competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in implementing its strategies to achieve such domestic growth 
to reduce its dependence on domestic revenues  the company has adopted a strategy to further penetrate international markets 
in implementing this strategy  the company faces barriers to entry and the risk of competition from local and other companies that already have established global businesses  risks generally associated with conducting business internationally  including exposure to currency fluctuations  limitations on foreign investment  import export controls  nationalization  unstable governments and legal systems and the additional expense and risks inherent in operating in geographically and culturally diverse locations 
because the company plans to develop its international business through acquisitions as well as joint ventures  co packaging arrangements and or other alliances  the company also may be subject to risks associated with such acquisitions  ventures  arrangements and alliances  including those relating to the marriage of different corporate cultures and shared decision making 
in addition  because the company s current international distribution capabilities are extremely limited  the company also will need to acquire a distribution network or enter into alliances with existing distributors before it can effectively conduct operations in new markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in increasing its international business in a profitable manner  and a failure to expand this business may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has a significant number of registered foreign trademarks as well as pending foreign trademark applications 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully register any foreign trademarks for which applications are currently pending or that such trademarks  once registered  together with any existing registered foreign trademarks  will be protected in the foreign markets in which they are used 
risks of potential acquisitions as previously disclosed  the company recently acquired freeman and sarah michaels 
the company may acquire or make substantial investments in additional complementary businesses or products in the future 
the freeman and sarah michaels acquisitions entailed  and any future acquisitions or investments would entail  various risks  including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired business or products  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business and  generally  the potential inability of the company to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
future acquisitions and investments by the company also could result in substantial cash expenditures  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect the company s financial results and condition 
the company engages from time to time in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions  some of which may be material 
adverse publicity  product recalls certain news broadcasts by major us television and radio networks have focused on the use of antibacterial agents to kill germs on various surfaces 
triclosan  the active ingredient in liquid dial  also has been a focus of these broadcasts 
although none of the broadcasts disputed that triclosan kills germs on the skin  some third party experts did question whether it provides any additional protection beyond that provided by non antibacterial soap products 
although the company has test results that it believes prove that triclosan provides consumers with additional protection in limiting exposure to bacteria related diseases  there can be no assurance that the publicity stemming from these broadcasts will not adversely affect the company s sales of its antibacterial soap products and its results of operations 
because the company shares the use of the armour trademark for food products with conagra inc  the manufacturer of armour branded non canned meat products  the company faces the risk that consumer preferences and perceptions with respect to any of the company s armour products may be influenced by adverse publicity affecting any of the armour branded products of conagra  inc from time to time  consumer product companies  including dial  have had to recall certain products for various reasons  which costs of recall or other liabilities could be material to such companies 
to date  the company has not made any product recalls that have been material to the company s financial condition 
in addition  adverse publicity regarding any such product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the company 
environmental concerns regarding detergent compound nonlyphenol ethoxylate npe is an ingredient used in the company s liquid and powder detergent products 
certain environmental and regulatory groups have raised concerns regarding the toxicity of compounds produced from npe as it decomposes and the adverse impact on the reproductive health of certain aquatic animals exposed to those compounds 
although to the best of the company s knowledge none of the studies undertaken on npe have demonstrated a link between the compound and such effect in the environment or in human beings  there can be no assurance that subsequent studies will  in fact  demonstrate such a link or demonstrate other adverse environmental consequences 
current government regulations do not impose any restrictions on the use of npe  or impose any liability on any of the businesses that utilize npe in the products they manufacture 
the company believes  however  that a number of governmental agencies in north america and europe are discussing formal regulations of npe in the environment 
the company is in the process of reformulating its detergents to eliminate this compound as an ingredient 
the additional expense the company expects to incur as a result of this reformulation is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
in addition  the company believes that it will not incur any significant environmental liability as a result of the use of npe in its products 
dependence on key personnel the operation of the company requires managerial expertise 
of the company s key personnel  only the chief executive officer has an employment contract with the company 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s key employees will remain in the company s employ 
the loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
turnover  employee relations primarily as a result of the restructuring of its business  the company discharged approximately salaried and non salaried employees during and in addition  the company experienced greater aggregate voluntary turnover of salaried employees in and than the industry average 
although the company believes that it presently has sufficient staffing  there can be no assurance that the company would not be materially adversely affected by any future significant voluntary turnover of salaried or other employees 
four of the company s seven plants in the united states are unionized 
certain of the company s contracts with its various unions are scheduled for renegotiation in as follows i oil  chemical and atomic workers union covering approximately employees at the company s bristol  pennsylvania  plant in may  ii united food and commercial workers union covering approximately employees at the company s aurora  illinois  plant in august  and iii the united food and commercial workers union covering approximately employees at the company s fort madison  iowa  plant in september in  the company successfully renegotiated its contract with the international brotherhood of teamsters covering approximately employees at the company s st 
louis  missouri  plant and madison county  illinois  distribution center  which now expires in august although the company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory  there can be no assurance that the company will not face similar labor disputes in the future or that such disputes will not be material to the company 
environmental matters the company is subject to a variety of environmental and health and safety laws in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
these laws and regulations pertain to the company s present and past operations 
since  the company has received notices or requests for information with respect to sites that have been deemed superfund sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  five of which are currently active  of which are inactive and eight of which have been settled 
the company also is engaged in investigatory and remedial activities with respect to four closed plants previously operated by former parent 
as of december   the company has accrued in its financial statements approximately million in reserves for expenses related to superfund sites and the cleanup of closed plant sites  which reserves it believes are adequate 
the company does not anticipate that the costs to comply with such laws and regulations or the costs related to superfund sites and the cleanup of closed plant sites will have any material adverse effect on the company s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  however  there can be no assurance that other developments  such as the emergence of unforeseen claims or liabilities or the imposition of increasingly stringent laws  regulations and enforcement policies will not result in material costs in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion of the company s exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates and commodity prices  as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
interest rate risk the company has short term debt and short term bank borrowings supported by a long term revolving credit agreement and a receivables purchase and sale program which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at december   the company had million in short term borrowings outstanding  million in receivables sold but not collected and million in long term debt outstanding 
of the long term debt outstanding  million is fixed rate debt and  accordingly  does not expose the company to risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates see note j to the company s consolidated financial statements 
both the short term debt of million and the remaining million of short term borrowings which are classified as long term borrowings because they are supported by the long term credit agreement are floating rate obligations 
in addition  the receivables purchase and sale program allows the company to sell its trade receivables prior to collection at a discount that closely approximates the day london interbank borrowing rate libor 
such discount rate reprices monthly 
if the floating rates were to change by from december   levels  annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would change by approximately  pretax and the annual discount paid for the sale of receivables not yet collected would change by approximately  pretax 
foreign currency the company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily us dollar canadian dollar  us dollar mexican peso and us dollar argentinean peso 
the argentinean peso s value has been pegged by the argentinean government as equal to the us dollar 
through december   this currency equivalency applied 
however  there can be no assurance in the future that the argentinean government will continue this policy or have the ability to ensure that the value of the argentinean peso will continue to equal the us dollar 
at december   one us dollar was worth canadian dollars and mexican pesos  respectively 
for the year ended december   the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuated between a high of c to c and the us dollar mexican peso exchange rate fluctuated between p and a low of p 
a hypothetical change in the exchange rates for the us dollar to the canadian dollar  the mexican peso and the argentinean peso from those at december   would result in an annual currency translation gain or loss of approximately million pretax 
commodity price risk in the manufacture of its products the company utilizes a number of materials that can be considered commodities  such as tallow  coconut oil and meat 
in addition  the company uses a variety of products that are priced based on underlying commodities  such as plastic bottles resin and packaging cardboard 
the company  in the normal course of business  attempts to enter into supply agreements that generally fix or set a range of prices of goods to be purchased 
these supply agreements can cover up to six to months of supply for goods 
financial derivatives to hedge or lock in the prices of these commodities over the long term generally are not available
