for training programs  clients pay a fee per student trained or a fee for classes offered  in some cases with an advance payment for the cost of the necessary training materials 
oem call center services consist of domestic and international telephone support for the end user customers of techteam s clients 
through the end of the first quarter  techteam provided oem call center services which were billed on a fee per call  fee per time spent on calls or per agent basis  each as negotiated with clients 
commencing in the fourth quarter techteam also provided oem call center services on a per agent basis to a joint venture formed with general electric appliances division gea

total other expenses income loss before interest income interest income income loss before tax provision tax provision 
net income loss the company believes that its growth has benefited from the trend among large corporations to outsource much of their information technology needs and techteam s ability to provide services that address a broad range of those needs 
the company believes that the outsourcing trend will continue and will provide continuing opportunities for all of its service offerings 
techteam further believes that its service offerings are influenced substantially by its clients desires to focus on their core businesses and to leave information technology needs to the company for which information technology is its core business 
techteam s training programs have encountered cyclical enrollment trends  influenced by the timing and extent to which clients are upgrading desk top software 
techteam s business is based on client relationships with major corporations

gea then contributed those contacts to the ge joint venture for an agreed value of million and an agreement that gea shall receive all the joint venture s earnings from these contracts until gea has recovered the million

these costs were and of revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in these ratios is attributable to reduced revenues per call  costs incurred for the ongoing customization of the company s global call center and those costs related to the start up of several new projects during the year for which revenues did not grow as rapidly as expected  and  for one project  which the company terminated shortly after it commenced due to it not being profitable

tax provision techteam recognized  of federal income tax credit in  resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to an effective tax rate of for the and effective tax rates differ due to changing amounts of permanent book tax differences  primarily goodwill and tax exempt interest 
the michigan single business tax and other state taxes in were  with an effective tax rate of compared to an effective rate of in these taxes are tied more closely to factors other than pre tax income which inflate the effective tax rate when income is lower and reduce the tax benefit when income is negative as in liquidity and capital resources over the three year period commencing january   the company s business has been financed by cash provided by operations  shares issued throughout the period under stock option plans and  from a public offering in indicators of the company s financial strength are summarized below december  december  working capital   current ratio debt as a percentage of total capitalization shareholders equity   the company s working capital was  at december   a decrease of from december   the decrease primarily resulting from the repurchase of company common stock see below and the impact of the acquisition of leasing operations 
available cash will be used for general corporate purposes  including domestic and international call center expansion  capital expenditures  working capital  acquisitions and stock repurchases under the company s stock repurchase program 
early in  techteam acquired techteam capital group  inc currently  the company has no arrangements or understandings with respect to any material acquisitions  although it continually monitors acquisition opportunities 
as a result of the acquisition of techteam capital group  debt aggregating  at december  is now included in the consolidated financial statements 
techteam capital group had financed its leasing activities through use of various forms of long term debt  primarily non recourse debt 
since its acquisition by techteam  techteam has provided the financing 
prior to this acquisition techteam had no significant debt outstanding 
in february  the board of directors of the company authorized a stock repurchase program 
the program provided for the open market and other purchase of up to  shares of the company s stock 
the company repurchased  shares under this program for  in in may  the board of directors of the company authorized another stock repurchase program 
the program provided for the open market and other purchase of up to  shares of the company s stock 
the company repurchased  shares under this program for  in in august  the company announced a third stock repurchase program to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock during the period ending august   unless extended 
by december   the company had repurchased  shares for  techteam has line of credit agreements with nbd bank which provide for short term borrowings of up to  the line of credit is unsecured 
nbd bank borrowings are at the prime rate 
there were no borrowings under this line during the year ended december  potentially unrealizable assets the company s statement of financial position includes amounts related to certain assets created by compuflex prior to its acquisition by techteam  the net book value of these assets at december  is  the assets consist of a contractual right to obtain from compuflex s affiliate in india  personnel trained in personal computer skills 
this right was originally recorded by compuflex at the discounted present value of salary cost savings expected to be realized because of the availability of these personnel 
the capitalized value is being amortized over the term of the contract which expires on july  software tools used by compuflex in the delivery of its services to clients 
these tools were purchased by compuflex at an agreed upon price for development by a related party 
the capitalized value is being amortized over years ending march  the realizability of these assets is dependent upon the company continuing to utilize the indian subsidiary as a source of personnel and to use the software tools in the delivery of its services 
it is management s opinion that the company will continue to realize the value of these assets 
at december   the company had recorded a net deferred tax asset of  which includes  related to net operating loss carryforwards which expire in and  related to alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards which do not expire 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company returning to profitability and generating regular taxable income in amounts sufficient to utilize the carryforwards 
over the past two years  the company has generated tax losses of approximately  it is management s opinion that the company will generate taxable income in management s opinion is based on the following factors from the second quarter through the third quarter  the company had consistently been profitable 
from through  taxable income aggregated approximately  the losses incurred in were primarily attributable to a temporary decline in the growth rate in business activity 
the company spent substantial amounts diversifying its client base so that growth could continue on a basis consistent with prior years and the company would be better positioned to deliver more profitable business due to concentrating on corporate business that historically has provided better profit margins 
the losses incurred in resulted substantially from the settlement costs associated with the class action suit initiated against the company in the third quarter and the write off of non performing assets due to merger related activities 
for  the company is forecasting a return to profitability as a result of new contracts put in place and efforts that have been  and continue to be  underway to reduce costs 
year disclosure techteam has a year yk steering committee reporting directly to the ceo and the board of directors 
the steering committee is charged with evaluating techteam s risks  recommending solutions and implementing the solution to the various problems that exist  and monitoring the remediation efforts 
the entire management of techteam is responsible to assure that the changes necessary are made to achieve readiness for the year techteam is engaged in a comprehensive effort to meet the year problems 
in order to evaluate its progress  techteam has established four phases necessary to assure readiness inventory identify key business areas potentially affected by yk concerns  analysis determine the impact and preparation of a plan to address the issue  remediation making the necessary changes to bring the system into compliance  and validation testing to ensure compliance 
techteam began the inventory process of its worldwide business systems in to determine their compliance 
this process was conducted by a team of internal employees in cooperation with oem hardware and software manufacturers 
in  the scope of the inventory was expanded to include facilities and non information technology related systems and equipment 
as of december   techteam has identified substantially all internal systems having potential year issues 
analysis of systems critical to the delivery of techteam s services  which are within techteam control  to address yk issues has been completed on of critical systems 
of these critical systems  about have been remedied 
techteam expects to complete the analysis  remediation and validation of its critical systems by june  analysis of non critical systems has been completed on of these systems 
techteam expects to complete the analysis  remediation and validation of its non critical systems by august  techteam has replaced its non compliant financial system 
it spent million  which was capitalized to be amortized over years  to replace the financial system 
techteam estimates that it will spend an additional  to  in to complete its yk project 
as necessary  the company will refine these estimates in the future 
these expenses may not include all of the cost of implementing contingency plans  which are in the process of being developed 
these estimates also do not include any litigation or warranty costs related to yk issues because they cannot be reasonably estimated 
use of independent verification and validation processes consistent with industry standards will be utilized to insure complete uninterrupted operability on critical systems 
the most likely it worst case scenario would be the failure of a telephone switch at one of techteam s support centers 
the most likely non it worst case scenario would be loss of operation at one of techteam s support centers due to environmental or security considerations 
the recovery procedure in either scenario would be to divert traffic to another center  which could take to hours 
it is worth noting that less than percent of techteam s weekly support center traffic occurs on weekends  such as the first two days of january significant impact to techteam  and its clients for such a failure would not occur until est  monday  january   which gives techteam additional time to react on behalf of itself and its clients 
in all other lines of business  the service can continue  without interruption  for several weeks without interface to techteam s it or non it systems 
factors affecting future results litigation as noted in item  the company has been sued for alleged violations of section b of the securities exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder  as well as claims against the individual defendants for alleged controlling person liability under section a of the securities exchange act 
the company has reached an agreement in principle to resolve these suits 
it is possible that these lawsuits will not be resolved on the terms proposed by the parties 
the failure of the completion of the settlement could have material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks inherent in leasing the acquisition of techteam capital group has introduced the company to a new type of risk the uncertainty of the residual value of equipment leased to clients 
given the rapid pace of technological change  it is difficult to determine  at the time of the lease  the value of the equipment after the expiration of the lease because the value of the equipment often depends upon the use of the equipment after the expiration of the lease 
for example  computer equipment is leased for two years 
following the completion of the lease term  the client can either return the equipment  purchase the equipment from the company  or re lease the equipment for varying lengths of time 
depending on the decision of the client  the company could be faced with the possibility of having over or under valued the residual value of the equipment 
accordingly  this uncertainty could result in fluctuations in the performance of techteam capital group 
impact of business with major clients historically  techteam has been heavily dependent upon major clients for a substantial portion of its revenues 
any loss of or failure to retain a significant amount of business with its key clients could have a material adverse impact on the company 
until  ford motor company ford was techteam s largest client 
ford accounted for  and of the company s revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in  hewlett packard became techteam s largest client  representing of techteam s revenues in that year 
in and  hewlett packard accounted for and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
in the past several years  daimlerchrysler corporation daimlerchrysler had also become a major client  representing between and of the company s total revenues in years prior to the percentage of total revenues derived from daimlerchrysler increased to and in and  respectively 
additionally  an international provider of shipping services became a significant client generating and of total revenues in and  respectively 
ford  daimlerchrysler and the international provider of shipping services are expected to continue to constitute a high percentage of techteam s revenues for the foreseeable future 
in the ge joint venture represented of the company s revenues  in that percentage grew to as a result of a full year s services for the ge joint venture  the sale of the oem call center product support business to the ge joint venture in march  and the commencement in august of oem call center support by the ge joint venture for a major manufacturer of personal computers 
management recognizes the need to diversify its client base from both a client and industry perspective 
however  because techteam believes that its existing client base presents opportunities for the cross marketing of its services  the company will continue to seek additional business from its largest clients 
the company anticipates that its major clients will continue to account for a high percentage of techteam s revenues in the future 
techteam s services are not specific to any single industry and can be beneficial to most large corporations 
techteam s technical staffing and training programs cover most of the popular software applications and can be customized to improve the productivity of microcomputer users in most companies 
techteam provided services to approximately customers in the following table sets forth certain information relating to techteam s customers accounting for more than of revenues in any of the past three years 
year ended december  daimlerchrysler revenues for the year    percentage increase from prior year percentage of total revenues ge techteam  lp revenues for the year   percentage increase from prior year  percentage of total revenues ford motor company revenues for the year    percentage increase decrease from prior year percentage of total revenues international provider of shipping services revenues for the year    percentage increase from prior year percentage of total revenues wayne county  michigan revenues for the year   percentage increase from prior year percentage of total revenues hewlett packard company revenues for the year    percentage increase decrease from prior year percentage of total revenues first year of business relationship services provided to ford and daimlerchrysler consist of contract computer end user support including on site help desks and call center services  programming services  documentation services and classroom training programs 
techteam provides these services to virtually all ford divisions and two finance related ford subsidiaries 
services provided to hewlett packard and the international provider of shipping services were technical product post sales support provided from techteam call center sites 
revenues from hewlett packard first commenced in mid with the award of the first contract for call center services 
the first full year of services under that contract was additional contracts were awarded in the contracts terminated in ability to manage growth the company has experienced significant growth in the past several years and anticipates continued growth from industry trends toward increases in information technology and in the outsourcing of services provided by the company 
techteam expects this continued growth to place a significant strain on the company s resources 
these resources could be further strained from the necessity to attract and retain qualified management personnel to manage the growth and operations of the company s business 
techteam cannot give any assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to be able to continue its historic growth rate or that it will be able adequately to manage that growth 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on operating results 
year compliance date sensitive computer applications that currently record years in a two digit  rather than a four digit  format may be unable to properly categorize and process dates occurring after december  the year problem 
the company does not expect to incur significant additional costs to make its software programs and operating systems year compliant 
however  if year related failures were to occur in the company s computer and information systems the company could incur significant  unanticipated liabilities and expenses 
in addition  the company is in the process of determining whether other companies with whom the company does business are year compliant 
the failure of any such company to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition the company faces intense competition in both the help desk and call center markets 
in the call center market  the company competes with other call center companies  some of which have substantially greater resources including more call center locations  greater financial resources  a larger client base and more name recognition 
in the corporate computer services market  the company competes with many entities including systems implementation firms  application software firms  staffing firms  large professional services firms  facilities management firms and computer consulting firms 
many of these firms have far greater resources  clients and name recognition than the company 
many of the company s customers purchase information technology services primarily from a limited number of preferred vendors 
in addition  many of the company s customers use a competitive bidding process in selecting their vendors 
as a result  the company has experienced and continues to anticipate significant pricing pressure from these customers in order to remain a preferred vendor 
the company also faces significant competition in both markets from its own clients and potential clients whose internal resources represent a fixed cost to the client 
such competition may impose additional pricing pressures on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete successfully with its existing competitors or with any new competitors 
joint venture operations the company is a party to a joint venture with general electric appliance 
the company provides personnel and services to the joint venture as a vendor and also participates as a joint venture partner in the operating results of the joint venture 
the operations of the joint venture are subject to a number of risks  uncertainties and general economic and market conditions  many of which parallel those faced by the company 
in addition  the company is dependent upon its co venturer for many facets of the joint venture s operations  particularly those relating to administrative and financial accounting functions 
each of the foregoing factors has a significant impact upon the ultimate results realized by the company from the joint venture s operations and its business relationship with the joint venture 
contract risks the great majority of the company s contracts are terminable without cause on short notice  often upon days notice 
other of the company s contracts expire on set dates and may not be renewed or replaced 
terminations and non renewals of major contracts can have a significant impact upon the company s revenues and operating results 
reliance on senior management the success of the company is highly dependent upon the efforts  direction  and guidance of its senior management 
although the company has entered into employment and noncompetition agreements with certain of its executive officers  the company s continued growth and success also depends in part on its ability to attract and retain qualified managers and on the ability of its executive officers and key employees to manage its operations successfully 
the loss of any of these senior executives or the company s inability to attract  retain or replace key management personnel in the future  could have a material adverse effect on it 
attraction and retention of employees the company s business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor intensive 
the company s success depends in large part upon its ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled technical  clerical and administrative employees 
qualified personnel are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
techteam cannot assure that it will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees in the future 
the failure to do so could have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
project risks many of the company s engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of its clients businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify 
the company s failure or inability to meet a client s expectations in the performance of its services could result in a material adverse change to the client s operations and therefore could give rise to claims against the company or damage the company s reputation  adversely affecting its relationship with its client  its business  operating results and financial condition 
variability of quarterly operating results variations in the company s revenue and operating results occur from time to time as a result of a number of factors  such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter  the number of business days in a quarter and employee hiring and utilization rates 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle can be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments and general economic conditions 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number of clients  assignments or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses to the company 
in addition  the company s engagements generally are terminable by the client without penalty 
cyclicality certain of the company s clients and potential clients are in industries  such as the automobile and financial services industries  that experience cyclical variations in profitability  which may in turn affect their willingness or ability to fund systems projects such as those for which the company may be engaged 
the company s experience indicates  however  that competitive pressures in cyclical industries could compel businesses to undertake projects even during periods of losses or reduced profitability 
interruption of telecommunications services the company s operations are dependent on its ability to protect its call centers against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar event 
the company has taken precautions to protect itself from events that could interrupt its operations  including off site storage of back up data  contractual arrangements for back up facilities with a leading disaster recovery services company and halon fire suppression systems in the data centers which are designed to extinguish a fire without damaging computer equipment 
no assurance can be given that such precautions will be adequate  and operations may still be interrupted  even for extended periods 
in addition  the on line services provided by the company are dependent on telecommunications links to the regional bell operating companies for which the company currently has no back up 
any damage to call centers or any failure of the company s telecommunication links that cause interruptions in the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company s property and business interruption insurance with current limits of million may not be adequate to compensate the company for all losses that may occur 
growth through acquisitions and new products the company s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of businesses and technology sources complementary to the company s business 
the company has acquired several significantly smaller companies in the past and believes that it has been successful in integrating the acquired assets and businesses into the company s operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that future acquisitions will be consummated on acceptable terms or that any acquired assets or business will be successfully integrated into the company s operations 
further  acquisitions may involve special risks such as diversion of management s attention  unanticipated events  legal liabilities and amortization of intangibles  any of which could have an adverse effect on the company s operations and earnings 
risks associated with international operations certain risks are inherent in the company s business strategy which includes plans for the global expansion of its operations 
among other things  the company may encounter difficulties in marketing  selling and delivering its services due to differences in cultures  languages  labor and employment policies and differing political and social systems 
in addition  the company may encounter significant effects on its operations and financial condition as a result of currency fluctuations and differing tax laws 
rapid technological changes  dependence on new solutions the company s success will depend in part on its ability to develop it solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in it  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in adequately addressing these developments on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  the company will be successful in the marketplace 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s services uncompetitive or obsolete 
the company s failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property rights the company s success is dependent upon certain methodologies it utilizes in designing  installing and integrating computer software and information systems and other proprietary intellectual property rights 
the company s business includes the development of custom software in connection with specific client engagements 
ownership of such software is generally assigned to the client 
the company also develops certain foundation and application software products  or software tools  which remain the property of the company 
the company relies upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret  copyright and trademark laws to protect its proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom the company licenses intellectual property 
the company enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and limits distribution of proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that the company will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights 
although the company believes that its services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and that it has all rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in its business  the company is subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
any such claims could require the company to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses of the intellectual property which is the subject of asserted infringement 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s stock has fluctuated over a wide range during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
see market for registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters 
the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market of the common stock  quarterly variations and actual anticipated operating results  growth rates  changes in estimates by analysts  market conditions in the industry in which the company competes  announcements by competitors  regulatory actions  litigation including class action litigation and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of high technology companies 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating results and prospects from time to time may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
any such event would likely result in a material adverse effect on the price of the common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no material market risk sensitive instruments nor material market risk exposures 
substantially all of the company s operations are in the united states 
the company s debt obligations have fixed interest rates and relatively short lives
