inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
if there were inflation  the company s efforts to cover cost increases with price increases could be limited in the short term by its relatively high backlog 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  management is currently evaluating the effects of this change on its recording of derivatives and hedging activities 
the company will adopt sfas no 
for its fiscal year ending december  in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  internal use software  which provides guidance on the accounting for the costs of software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not expect the statement to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s exchange rate risk management the company regularly enters into forward contracts in european and japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position and firm commitments 
the company s firm commitments consist of certain orders received in currencies other than us dollars 
forward currency contracts have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce the company s risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
the company does not engage in currency speculation 
at december  the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy and sell us dollars for non us currencies was million and million  respectively 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately million 
however  since these contracts hedge non us currency transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged 
the hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at december  and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk management due to its short term duration the fair value of the company s cash and investment portfolio at december  approximated carrying value 
interest rate risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for issues contained in the investment portfolio 
the resulting hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k and the company s annual report to shareholders may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in item business relating to the company s delivery time of unfilled orders  and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and planned capital expenditures  may be forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for test equipment  including systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company believes that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that any future increase in semiconductor test systems bookings for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters 
in addition  any factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights  including patents  copyrights  and trade secrets 
while the company believes that its patents  copyrights  and trade secrets have value  in general no single one is in itself essential 
the company believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its research and development personnel 
from time to time the company is notified that it may be in violation of patents held by others 
an assertion of patent infringement against the company  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the company or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the development of new technologies  commercialization of those technologies into products  and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to the company s success 
successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors  including new product selection  development of competitive products by competitors  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations 
the company faces substantial competition  throughout the world  in each operating segment 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
the company also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers 
certain of the company s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those currently offered by the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the united states 
international sales are subject to significant risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and policy changes affecting the company s markets  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors and representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in the recent past there has been significant economic instability in several countries in asia 
continued economic instability would increase the likelihood of either a direct or indirect adverse impact on the company s future operating results 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its competitors products  fulfilling backlog on a timely basis  reliance on sole source suppliers  potential retrofit costs  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  and the timing of investments in engineering and development 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
year readiness the year problem arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the company is employing a combination of internal resources and outside consultants to coordinate and implement its program for year readiness 
the company has committed to having all its current products year ready in advance of the year all of the company s current products have been assessed  using industry accepted test procedures  and most have been determined to be year ready 
the company has also evaluated which of its former products  still in use but no longer sold  will be made year ready 
the schedule of company products which will or will not be made year ready is published and updated regularly by the company on its web site 
the company has completed an inventory and assessment of internal business systems that use date sensitive software 
the company is actively working with suppliers and using consultants and internal engineering resources to modify or replace internal business systems depending on the level of criticality for the company s ongoing operations 
the company is also at risk of disruption to its business if year problems are experienced by its key suppliers 
to mitigate this risk  the company has contacted its suppliers to assess their year readiness and continually monitors the progress of its key suppliers 
alternate suppliers are being qualified in appropriate circumstances 
most of the company s effort toward year readiness is funded as ongoing operating expenses  as a part of ongoing software support operations 
the company is not able to estimate the amount of accelerated upgrade costs which have been or will be incurred for third party software or systems 
expenditures directly related to the year readiness program  consisting primarily of dedicated staff and consulting services  are estimated at less than million through the company believes that its year readiness project will be completed on a timely basis 
the company believes that the year transition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or overall trends in its operating results 
however  there can be no assurance that unexpected delays or problems  including failure of year readiness programs by its product and service suppliers  will not occur and have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or performance  or its competitive position 
the company has not yet adopted formal contingency plans  but such plans are under active development at this time
