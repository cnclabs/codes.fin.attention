the obligations of the company under the credit agreement are secured by a first priority lien on all owned or acquired tangible and intangible assets of the company and a pledge to gecc of the capital stock of the us subsidiaries of the company including the subsidiary that owns the company s foreign subsidiaries 
borrowings available under the credit agreement are used for general working capital  to support capital expenditures and  if necessary  to effect acquisitions

at may   the company had million of available credit under the credit agreement 
the company is presently evaluating its financing requirements and has commenced discussions with its current lender and other banking institutions regarding a new credit facility and or other financing alternatives

the company expects to fund its long term capital requirements for the next twelve months through the use of operating cash flow supplemented as necessary by borrowings under the credit agreement or alternative financing see note to the consolidated financial statements

the company paid a quarterly dividend of per share annual dividend of per share for fiscal in addition  the company paid a quarterly dividend of per share subsequent to year end 
the dividend was declared to be payable on june  to holders of all classes of common stock of record at the close of business on june  the company s board of directors will determine dividend policy in the future based upon  among other things  the company s results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant at the time

impact of inflation the company has historically been able to pass inflationary increases for raw materials and other costs onto its customers through price increases and anticipates that it will be able to continue to do so in the future 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal  with lower sales typically realized during the first and second fiscal quarters and higher sales typically realized during the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company believes such fluctuations in sales are the result of greater marketing and promotional activities toward the end of each fiscal year  customer buying patterns  and consumer spending patterns related primarily to the consumers interest in achieving personal health and fitness goals after the beginning of each new calendar year and before the summer fashion season 
furthermore  as a result of changes in product sales mix and other factors  as discussed above  the company experiences fluctuations in gross profit and operating margins on a quarter to quarter basis

to be material in relation to its financial statements 
year in fiscal the company initiated a year compliance project the year project
