management is of the opinion that such sources of cash are sufficient for the ensuing fiscal year 
certain trends and uncertainties the company has in the past and may in the future make forward looking state ments 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the following technological change and competition the markets for the company s products are characterized by frequent new product introductions and declining average selling prices over product life cycles 
the company s future success is highly dependent upon the timely completion and introduction of new products at competitive prices and performance levels 
in addition  the company must respond to competitors in the company s markets 
if the company is not able to make timely introduction of new products or to respond effectively to competition  its business and operating results could be adversely affected 
variable demand the consumer adhesives industry has historically been reasonably stable and not characterized by cyclical product demand 
the manicure implement business cook bates has had seasonal demand peaks during the last half of the calendar year 
political and economic considerations in prior years  a significant portion of the company s net sales and operating profit growth have come from international revenues 
as a result  the company s business activities and its results could be significantly affected by the policies of foreign governments and prevailing political  social  and economic conditions 
the company s revenue during fiscal year was not materially impacted by the widespread weakness in asian currencies and it is not certain what the long term effect of the weakness of asian currencies and the liquidity situation will be on our business 
availability of raw materials the consumer adhesive and manicure implement industries have ample manufacturing capacity and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if its raw material suppliers are unwilling or unable to supply a timely and sufficient supply of product to the company 
intellectual property matters the consumer adhesive industry is characterized by minimal litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company has on occasion been notified that it may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers purchasing products from the company have rights to indemnification and may  under certain circumstances violate the intellectual property rights of others 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations  and the company has successfully resolved these situations in the past  there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement  or that the company will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms 
an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
year risks the efficient operations of the company are dependent  in part  upon its computer software programs  systems and processes collectively  the informa tion systems 
the company s information systems are used in several key areas of the company  including  but not limited to  warehousing and distribution  merchandising and purchasing  inventory management  and accounting and financial reporting 
the company is in the process of updating its information systems for year compliance requirements 
additionally  the company has also been in communication with some of its vendors  financial institutions and others whose computer software  programs and information systems may interface with those of the company to assess the status of their compliance with year requirements 
failure of companies that the company conducts business with to comply with the year requirements could have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
based on the information currently available  the company believes it will meet the year compliance requirements through a combination of information systems modifications and through the acquisition of new equipment and techno logy that are year compliant 
the company believes that costs required to replace or modify information systems  will not be material and that it will successfully achieve compliance with the year requirements  however no assurances can be given that the company s information systems and its vendors  financial institutions and others will be successful in achieving year compliance 
worst case scenario and contingency plan we believe we have taken and continue to take all prudent steps to identify and remediate our year exposure and that we have an effective program in place to address any year problems in a timely manner 
our expectations regarding our year efforts  however  are subject to various uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed here 
those uncertaintites include our success in identifying systems that are not year compliant and the success of vendors  suppliers  customers and other third parties we interact with in addressing any year problems they might have 
we believe that our most reasonable worst case scenario is that there could be some interruptions in deliveries from our third party vendors and possibly in our interactions with customers  to the extent that they have their own year problems 
we have not developed a specific contingency plan to deal with the year problem because  in the ordinary course of business  we maintain a general contingency plan for emergencies 
in this regard  each of our departments is responsible for ensuring that they have back up capabilities to eliminate or minimize the negative effects of emergencies 
in addition  we maintain inven tories capable of supporting sales activities for approximately days with an additional days of inventory in transit to our facility at any given time 
we will consider developing more specific contingency plan as we complete assessment of our non information systems and our third party exposure over the next few months
