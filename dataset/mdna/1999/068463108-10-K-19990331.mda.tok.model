safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies as a reward for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined loss parameters 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to the company  the company s respective independent third party claims administrator tpa analyzes the details of the injury and develops a case reserve  which is the tpa s estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and its professional judgment 
the company then records  or accrues  an expense and a corresponding liability based upon the tpa s estimates for claims reserves 
as cash payments are made by the company s tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa also reviews existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjusts the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
the company has established additional reserves to provide for future unanticipated increases in expenses adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open injury claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods

diluted net income per share for was compared to for revenues for totaled  which represented a decrease of  or from revenues of  to date  the revenue trend has not been a company wide issue and has been primarily confined to a few larger branch offices 
the decline in revenues is related to a limited number of large staffing customers that have been affected by various economic conditions 
staffing services revenue decreased  or  while professional employer services revenue increased  or  which resulted in a decrease in the share of staffing services to of total revenues for  as compared to for the decline in staffing services revenue for was primarily attributable to two factors management s decision not to renew a business relationship with a large seasonal customer which was anticipated to provide an unacceptable profit margin and a moderation in the demand for the company s services by a limited number of large staffing customers that were affected by various economic conditions 
the share of professional employer services revenues had a corresponding increase from of total revenues for to for gross margin for totaled  representing an increase of  or over the gross margin rate of of revenues represents a basis point increase from due primarily to lower payroll taxes and benefits and workers compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues  offset in part by higher direct payroll costs as a percentage of revenues 
the decline in payroll taxes and benefits  in total dollars and as a percent of revenues  for was primarily due to lower state unemployment tax rates 
the increase in direct payroll costs  as a percentage of revenues  was primarily attributable to the increased share of professional employer services business  where payroll costs typically represent a higher percentage of revenues as compared to staffing services 
the company expects gross margin  as a percentage of revenues  to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  as well as by the adequacy of its estimates for workers compensation liabilities  which may be negatively affected by unanticipated adverse loss development of claims reserves 
workers compensation expense decreased from of revenues for to of revenues for the decrease in workers compensation expense for was generally attributable to a lower incidence of injuries during  as compared to selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses incident to the operation of the company s headquarters and the branch offices and the marketing of its services 
sg a expenses excluding the amortization of intangibles for amounted to  a decrease of  or from sg a expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues also decreased from for to for the decrease in total sg a expenses for from was primarily attributable to lower management payroll and bad debt expense 
during the first quarter of  management implemented specific performance criteria for all branch offices to align operating expenses more closely with growth in gross margin dollars rather than growth in revenues 
for  improvement in sg a expense was achieved by reducing sg a expenses as a percent of gross margin dollars from in to in management believes that its zone management practices and tighter operating controls implemented in have enhanced the company s ability to more effectively manage its operating costs 
amortization of intangibles totaled  for or of revenues  which compares to  or of revenues for the company s effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the increase in the effective rate was primarily attributable to the nondeductibility of certain merger expenses and an increase in nondeductible amortization expense 
the company offers various qualified employee benefit plans to its employees  including its worksite employees 
these qualified employee benefit plans include a savings plan the k plan under section k of the internal revenue code the code  a cafeteria plan under code section  a group health plan  a group life insurance plan  a group disability insurance plan and an employee assistance plan 
generally  qualified employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the code and the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  qualified plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a peo arrangement has not been established 
the tax exempt status of the company s k plan and cafeteria plan is subject to continuing scrutiny and approval by the internal revenue service the irs and depends upon the company s ability to establish the company s employer employee relationship with peo employees 
the issue of whether the company s tax qualified benefit plans can legally include worksite employees under their coverage has not yet been resolved 
if the worksite employees cannot be covered by the plans  then the exclusive benefit requirement imposed by the code would not be met by the plans as currently administered and the plans could be disqualified 
the irs has established a market segment study group regarding employee leasing for the stated purpose of examining whether peos  such as the company  are the employers of worksite employees under the code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans and are  therefore  able to offer to worksite employees benefit plans that qualify for favorable tax treatment 
the irs study group is reportedly also examining whether the owners of client companies are employees of peo companies under code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans 
to the best of the company s knowledge  the market segment study group has not issued a report 
a peo company headquartered in texas stated publicly over three years ago that the irs national office was being requested by the irs houston district to issue a technical advice memorandum tam on the peo worksite employee issue in connection with an ongoing audit of a plan of the texas peo company 
the stated purpose of tams is to help irs personnel in closing cases and to establish and maintain consistent holdings 
the irs s position is that tams are not precedential  that is  they are limited to the particular taxpayer involved and that taxpayer s set of facts 
the draft request for a tam by the irs houston district reportedly stated its determination that the texas peo company s code section k plan should be disqualified for the reason  among others  that it covers worksite employees who are not employees of the peo company 
the timing and nature of the issuance and contents of any tam regarding the worksite employee issue or any report of the market segment study group regarding employee leasing is unknown at this time 
there has also been public discussion for the past several years of the possibility that the treasury department may propose some form of administrative relief or that congress may provide legislative resolution or clarification regarding this issue 
in the event the tax exempt status of the company s benefit plans were to be discontinued and the benefit plans were to be disqualified  such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is not presently able to predict the likelihood of disqualification nor the resulting range of loss  in light of the lack of public direction from the irs or congress 
years ended december  and net income for amounted to  a decrease of  or from net income of  the decrease in net income from was primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage  which resulted primarily from increased payroll costs as a percentage of revenues  offset in part by lower income taxes as a percentage of revenues 
diluted net income per share for was compared to for total revenues were  which represented an increase of  or over revenues of  the increase in revenues over was primarily due to a internal growth rate of  combined with the effect from a full year of operations for five acquisitions  as well as from two acquisitions in the first half of staffing services revenues increased over primarily as a result of the growth in large contract staffing and on site management services and the effect of a full year of operations for the acquisitions 
peo services revenues increased over due to the effect from a full year of operations for the acquisitions 
revenues from staffing services  as a percent of total revenues  increased in to as compared to of total revenues in gross margin for totaled  representing an increase of  or over the gross margin rate of of revenues represents a basis point decline from due primarily to increases in direct payroll costs as a percentage of revenues

workers compensation expense increased from of revenues for to of revenues for the increase in the total number of injury claims for over was due in large part to a new policy implemented in which records first aid type claims 
such claims totaled for and were not recorded in the increase in workers compensation expense for was generally attributable to a moderately higher incidence of injuries during  as compared to  and management s decision to i continue to increase the company s accrual for future adverse loss development of open claims and ii build an accrual for potential future catastrophic workers compensation claims 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses excluding the amortization of intangibles for amounted to  an increase of  or over sg a expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased from for to for the increase in total sg a dollars for over was primarily attributable to incremental branch office expenses as a result of four acquisitions after october   the opening of four new offices in and early  the addition of experienced personnel at several offices to expand the company s managerial resources and an approximate  increase in bad debt expense 
two customers accounted for over one half of the increase in bad debt expense for amortization of intangibles totaled  for  or of revenues  which compares to  or of revenues for the increased amortization expense for was primarily attributable to amortization arising from the four acquisitions made after october  fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has historically experienced significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and expects such fluctuations to continue in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as seasonality  wage limits on payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand and competition for the company s services and the effect of acquisitions 
the company s revenue levels fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonality on its staffing services business and on certain of its peo clients in the agriculture and forest products related industries 
as a result  the company may have greater revenues and net income in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 
payroll taxes and benefits fluctuate with the level of direct payroll costs but tend to represent a smaller percentage of revenues later in the company s fiscal year as federal and state statutory wage limits for unemployment and social security taxes are exceeded by some employees 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter  as well as adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position of  at december  increased  from december  the increase was primarily due to  of cash provided by operating activities  offset by  for the combined payments on credit line borrowings and long term debt   used for the purchase of property and equipment and  used for acquisitions

for  cash flow was primarily generated by net income and depreciation and amortization expenses  together with an increase of  in accrued payroll and benefits 
net cash used in investing activities totaled  for  as compared to  for during  the company had capital expenditures of  and paid  in cash for the purchase of bolt staffing 
approximately  of the total capital expenditures was related to new computer hardware and software for the company s new management information system  which will address all concerns related to the year issue  as discussed in item under management information system and below under year readiness 
during  the company paid  in cash in connection with the hr only and tlc staffing acquisitions and had capital expenditures of  at march   the company had no material long term capital commitments 
net cash used in financing activities for totaled  which compares to  net cash used in financing activities for for  the principal use of cash for financing activities was for repayments of credit line borrowings of  and long term debt of  and for payment of  to a dissenting wimi shareholder in connection with the wimi merger 
for  the principal use of cash used in financing activities arose from the company s obligation to redeem  shares of its common stock at a value of  pursuant to a plan and agreement of reorganization between staffamerica  inc and the company 
the cash used for this stock redemption was offset in part by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants totaling  and net proceeds from credit line borrowings of  the company negotiated an amendment to its loan agreement with its principal bank  effective february   to increase the revolving credit facility by million  from million to million 
this facility includes a subfeature for letters of credit  as to which approximately million was outstanding as of december  as such  the company currently has approximately million of unused availability on its line of credit 
there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility at december  see note of the notes to financial statements 
management believes that the credit facility and other potential sources of financing  together with anticipated funds generated from operations  will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
on february   the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to  common shares from time to time in open market purchases 
management anticipates that the capital necessary to execute this program will be provided by existing cash balances 
inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims 
year readiness the company has developed a year plan to ensure its internal operational readiness  as well as compliance by the company s key vendors 
management s plan is focused on evaluating the readiness of the company s mission critical applications software  operating systems software  hardware  communications  third party interfaces  facilities typically non information technology systems and key vendors 
this evaluation process involves four phases identification of risks  assessment of risks  development of remediation and contingency plans  and testing and implementation 
as the company has previously reported  management initiated a project in mid to convert its information systems to new technologies which are expected to enable the company to more effectively accommodate its anticipated growth 
this upgrade is anticipated to be completed in mid and is expected to alleviate the year issue for such mission critical applications as payroll processing and financial reporting systems 
the company has incurred capital expenditures of million through december   for this project and expects to incur another million prior to completion 
the remaining mission critical application is a branch level legacy system which is expected to require only minor reprogramming by the company s internal staff during the first half of at no incremental cost to the company 
mission critical applications are currently in a remediation or testing phase 
management is currently uncertain as to the need for contingency plans for the company s mission critical applications  as it expects these systems to be fully operational by the third quarter of the company s assessment of the risks associated with non mission critical systems is incomplete but ongoing  and as such  management cannot predict whether significant problems will be identified  and if so  the costs to remediate such problems 
in addition  management has not yet identified any reasonably likely worst case scenarios or determined the extent of contingency planning that may be required 
costs identified to date  however  have not been material 
as part of its assessment  the company is relying on assurances from key vendors that their products and services will be year compliant 
the risks associated with the year problem are pervasive and complex  can be difficult to identify and to address  and can result in material adverse consequences to the company 
even if the company  in a timely manner  completes all of its assessments  identifies and tests remediation plans believed to be adequate  and develops contingency plans believed to be adequate  some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the company 
also  the company s business may be adversely affected by events outside its control  such as disruptions to services provided by utilities  banks or transportation or telecommunications networks
