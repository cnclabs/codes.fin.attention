the contract provides for total payments of approximately billion over an eight year period  commencing with the season 
under the terms of the contract  the nfl has the right to cancel the contract after years 
the programming rights fees under the new contract are significantly higher than those required by the previous contract and the fee increases exceed the estimated revenue increases over the contract term 
the higher fees under the new contract reflect various factors  including increased competition for sports programming rights and an increase in the number of games to be broadcast by espn 
the company is pursuing a variety of strategies  including marketing efforts  to reduce the impact of the higher costs 
the contract s impact on the company s results over the remaining contract term is dependent upon a number of factors  including the strength of advertising markets  effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences 
the cost of the nfl contract is charged to expense based on the ratio of each period s gross revenues to estimated total gross revenues over the non cancelable contract period 
estimates of total gross revenues can change significantly and  accordingly  they are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted if necessary 
such adjustments could have a material effect on results of operations in future periods

the company also has the ability to borrow under a us shelf registration statement and a euro medium term note program  which collectively permit the issuance of up to approximately billion of additional debt 
the company believes that its financial condition is strong and that its cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
other matters year the yk problem 
during the year  the company continued to devote significant resources throughout its business operations to minimize the risk of potential disruption from the year yk problem 
this problem is a result of computer programs having been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any information technology it systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations and system failures 
the problem also extends to many non it systems  that is  operating and control systems that rely on embedded chip systems 
in addition  like every other business enterprise  the company is at risk from yk failures on the part of its major business counterparties  including suppliers  distributors  licensees and manufacturers  as well as potential failures in public and private infrastructure services  including electricity  water  gas  transportation and communications 
system failures resulting from the yk problem could adversely affect operations and financial results in all of the company s business segments 
failures may affect security  payroll operations or employee and guest health and safety  as well as such routine but important operations as billing and collection 
in addition  the company s business segments face more specific risks 
for example in the media networks segment  at risk operations include satellite transmission and communication systems 
yk failures in such systems could adversely affect the company s television and radio networks  including cable services  as well as its owned and operated stations 
in the studio entertainment segment  yk failures could interfere with critical systems in such areas as the production  duplication and distribution of motion picture and home video product 
the company s theme parks and resorts operations could be significantly impeded by failures in hotel and cruise line reservation and operating systems  in theme park operating systems  including those controlling individual rides  attractions  parades and shows  and in security  health and safety systems 
in the consumer products segment  operations that could be significantly affected include the ordering  distribution and sale of merchandise at the company s retail stores 
in the internet and direct marketing segment  system failures could affect systems available to disney guests on the internet  online security and internal operations such as web page maintenance 
addressing the problem 
the company has developed a six phase approach to resolving the yk issues that are reasonably within its control 
all of these efforts are being coordinated through a senior level task force chaired by the company s chief information officer cio  as well as individual task forces in each major business unit 
as of september   approximately employees were devoting more than half of their time to yk efforts  in addition to approximately expert consultants retained on a full time basis to assist with specific potential problems 
the cio reports periodically to the audit review committee of the board of directors with respect to the company s yk efforts 
the company s approach to and the anticipated timing of each phase are described below 
phase inventory 
the first phase entailed a worldwide inventory of all hardware and software including business and operational applications  operating systems and third party products that may be at risk  and identification of key third party businesses whose yk failures might most significantly impact the company 
the it system inventory process  as well as the inventories of key third party businesses and of internal non it systems have been completed 
phase assessment 
once each at risk system was identified  the yk task forces assessed how critical the system was to business operations and the potential impact of failure in order to establish priorities for repair or replacement 
systems were classified as critical  important or non critical 
a critical system is one that  if not operational  would cause the shutdown of all or a portion of a business unit within two weeks  while an important system is one that would cause such a shutdown within two months 
this process has been completed for all it systems  resulting in the identification of nearly business systems that are critical to continued functioning and more than  that are either important or are otherwise being monitored 
the assessment process for internal non it systems and for key third party businesses has also been completed 
phase strategy 
this phase involved the development of appropriate remedial strategies for both it and non it systems 
these strategies included repairing  testing and certifying  replacing or abandoning particular systems as discussed under phases and below 
selection of appropriate strategies was based upon such factors as the assessments made in phase  the type of system  the availability of a yk compliant replacement and cost 
the strategy phase has been completed for all it and non it systems 
phase remediation 
the remediation phase involves creating detailed project plans  marshalling necessary resources and executing the strategies chosen 
for it systems  this phase has been completed 
for non critical systems  most corrections are expected to be completed by december  for those systems that are not expected to be reliably functional after january   detailed manual workaround plans will be developed prior to the end of phase testing and certification 
this phase includes establishing a test environment  performing systems testing with third parties if necessary and certifying the results 
the certification process entails having functional experts review test results  computer screens and printouts against pre established criteria to ensure system compliance 
the testing and certification of all critical and important it systems has been completed 
testing for non it systems has been completed  and where feasible and practical  the systems have been tested by either validating that the system has no date function  is not date aware  or operates properly when the millennial date is tested 
in other cases  the company has reviewed vendor or manufacturer design specifications  drawings  lab results or test data in order to verify proper date capability 
where the company has not received adequate assurance of successful certification efforts by third parties  contingency plans have been established to minimize potential disruption to operations 
the company has initiated written and telephonic communications with key third party businesses  as well as public and private providers of infrastructure services  to ascertain and evaluate their efforts in addressing yk compliance 
the company has tested as many online interfaces between critical business partners as is practical 
in cases where joint testing has not been possible  the company has reviewed partners test scripts and other indications that ongoing communications and commerce will not be disrupted 
for critical partners systems interactions with the company  it and functional experts will carefully review the evidence of correct operation at the earliest possible time in the new year 
manual and semi automated workarounds have been developed  where practical 
for many hundreds of vendors and partners for which the company does not rely upon automated interfaces  but rather  relies on physical supplies of food  merchandise  fuel and general supplies  safety stocks of critical items have been  or will be  secured 
phase contingency planning 
this phase involves addressing any remaining open issues expected in and early contingency planning is now the primary focus of efforts throughout the company 
primary emphasis is on guest and employee safety and comfort  followed by our desire to continue to generate revenues and minimize any unnecessary costs caused by unexpected outages 
contingency plans have been developed by all business segments 
they include  as appropriate  plans for guest evacuation from rides  theme parks and other entertainment settings  assuring that guests and employees are safe and warm  protection of assets and continued operation in the event of loss of power or communications and the resumption of normal business operations at the earliest time possible 
costs 
the company anticipates that expenditures related to the yk project will total million  of which million is expected to be capitalized 
the majority of these costs have been incurred as of september  a significant portion of these costs has not been incremental  but rather reflected redeployment of internal resources from other activities 
the company believes that these redeployments did not have a material adverse effect on other ongoing business operations 
all costs of the yk project are being borne out of the company s operating cash flow 
based upon its efforts to date  the company believes that the vast majority of both its it and non it systems  including all critical and important systems  will remain up and running after january  accordingly  the company does not currently anticipate that internal systems failures will result in any material adverse effect to its operations or financial condition 
during  the company has continued its efforts to ensure that major third party businesses and public and private providers of infrastructure services  such as utilities  communications services and transportation  will also be prepared for the year  and to develop contingency plans to address any failures on their part to become yk compliant 
at this time  the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario involves potential disruptions in areas in which the company s operations must rely on such third parties whose systems may not work properly after january  in addition  the company s international operations may be adversely affected by failures of businesses in other parts of the world to take adequate steps to address the yk problem 
while such failures could affect important operations of the company and its subsidiaries  either directly or indirectly  in a significant manner  the company cannot presently estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures 
it is important to note that the description of the company s efforts necessarily involves estimates and projections with respect to activities required in the future 
these estimates and projections are subject to change as work continues  and such changes may be substantial 
conversion to the euro currency on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro ends june  issues facing the company as a result of the introduction of the euro include converting information technology systems  reassessing currency risk  negotiating and amending licensing agreements and contracts  and processing tax and accounting records 
the company is addressing these issues and does not expect the euro to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward looking  including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to the company s stockholders 
management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters  including further restructuring or strategic initiatives and actions relating to the company s strategic sourcing initiative  as well as from developments beyond the company s control including changes in global economic conditions that may  among other things  affect the international performance of the company s theatrical and home video releases  television programming and consumer products and  in addition  uncertainties associated with the internet  the launching or prospective development of new business initiatives  year remediation efforts and the introduction of the euro  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
these statements are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions  as of the time the statements are made  regarding future events and business performance 
there can be no assurance  however  that management s expectations will necessarily come to pass 
factors that may affect forward looking statements 
for an enterprise as large and complex as the company  a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance  including the following changes in company wide or business unit strategies  which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which the company is involved or chooses to invest  changes in us  global or regional economic conditions  which may affect attendance and spending at the company s theme parks and resorts  purchases of company licensed consumer products and the performance of the company s broadcasting and motion picture operations  changes in us and global financial and equity markets  including significant interest rate fluctuations  which may impede the company s access to  or increase the cost of  external financing for its operations and investments  increased competitive pressures  both domestically and internationally  which may  among other things  affect the performance of the company s theme park  resort and regional entertainment operations and lead to increased expenses in such areas as television programming acquisition and motion picture production and marketing  legal and regulatory developments that may affect particular business units  such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities  consumer products  broadcasting or internet activities or the protection of intellectual properties  the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas  and changes in international tax laws or currency controls  adverse weather conditions or natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  which may  among other things  impair performance at the company s theme parks and resorts  technological developments that may affect the distribution of the company s creative products or create new risks to the company s ability to protect its intellectual property  labor disputes  which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations in any of the company s business units  and changing public and consumer taste  which may affect the company s entertainment  broadcasting and consumer products businesses 
this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements is illustrative  but by no means exhaustive 
accordingly  all forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty 
item a 
market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and the fair market value of certain of its investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments 
the company s objectives in managing its exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its portfolio of borrowings 
the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage  which is set by policy 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on its core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenues 
the company uses option strategies that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  revenues 
the principal currencies hedged are the japanese yen  european euro  australian dollar  british pound and canadian dollar 
the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities in the same principal currencies 
by policy  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its anticipated foreign exchange exposures for periods not to exceed five years 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
in addition  the company uses forward sale contracts to minimize the exposure to changes in fair market value of certain of its investments in debt and equity securities 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency  interest rate transactions and forward sale contracts only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
value at risk the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques which can be used in the var computation 
the company s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at year end and over each of the four quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during the year 
the model includes all of the company s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts 
the values of foreign exchange options do not change on a one to one basis with the underlying currencies  as exchange rates vary 
therefore  the hedge coverage assumed to be obtained from each option has been adjusted to reflect its respective sensitivity to changes in currency values 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the company s financial instruments at september  and the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model  follows unaudited  in millions interest rate currency sensitive financial sensitive financial combined instruments instruments portfolio var as of september  average var during the year ended september  new accounting guidance in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  subsequently amended by sfas no 
 which the company is required to adopt effective october  sfas will require the company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in derivative fair values will either be recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of related hedged assets  liabilities and firm commitments or  for forecasted transactions  deferred and recorded as a component of other stockholders equity until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the impact of sfas on the company s financial statements will depend on a variety of factors  including future interpretative guidance from the fasb  the future level of forecasted and actual foreign currency transactions  the extent of the company s hedging activities  the types of hedging instruments used and the effectiveness of such instruments 
however  the company does not believe the effect of adopting sfas will be material to its financial position
