cash was invested primarily for capital expenditures which totaled million  primarily for the installation of on demand systems in new hotel installations and conversions of spectravision equipped hotels 
the company s principal cash requirements in are expected to include the continued conversion of spectravision properties to ocv s more dependable on demand technology  the installation of systems in new hotels  both domestically and abroad  and the selected deployment of the company s new digital technology 
the company anticipates these activities will require capital expenditures of approximately to million in the company believes that its internally generated cash and its remaining capacity under its credit facility will provide sufficient funding for the foreseeable future 
revolving credit facility on november   the company refinanced its former credit facility and entered into an amended and restated agreement the credit facility 
under the amended credit facility  the amount available to the company was increased from million to million  and certain other terms were amended 
the credit facility matures in november and  subject to certain conditions  can be renewed for two additional years 
at december   there was million of available borrowings under the credit facility  subject to certain covenant restrictions 
limitations on additional debt financing on command corporation and ascent entered into a corporate agreement  as amended the corporate agreement  pursuant to which occ has agreed with ascent not to incur any indebtedness without ascent s prior consent  other than indebtedness under the credit facility  and indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of operations which together shall not exceed million in the aggregate through december  foreign exchange the company believes the risks of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on its present operations are not material to the company s overall financial condition 
however  should the company s international operations continue to grow  occ will consider using foreign currency contracts  swap arrangements  or other financial instruments designed to limit exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
business risks control by ascent ascent owned approximately of the outstanding occ common stock at december  accordingly  ascent has the ability to control the management and policies of on command corporation and the outcome of matters submitted to the stockholders for approval  including the election of directors 
in addition  the company and ascent have entered into a corporate agreement which requires the company to get ascent s approval with respect to incurring indebtedness and issuing equity 
dependence on additional capital for growth the growth of on command corporation s business requires substantial investment on a continuing basis to finance capital expenditures and related expenses 
prior to the acquisition  occ has relied on capital provided by ascent and cash flow from operations to finance its growth 
however  ascent is not obligated to provide any additional capital or debt financing to on command corporation 
on command corporation intends to use cash flow from operations and additional borrowings subject to the limitations discussed under limitations on additional debt financings to support its growth 
whether or when on command corporation can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support its anticipated growth cannot be accurately predicted 
unless such cash flow levels are achieved  on command corporation may require additional borrowings or the sale of debt or equity securities subject to the limitations described under limitations on additional debt financings  or some combination thereof  to provide funding for growth or  alternatively  may have to reduce growth to a level that can be supported by internally generated cash flow 
on command corporation can give no assurances with respect to the impact on the results of operations and financial condition if on command corporation is required to reduce growth to a level that can be supported by internally generated cash flow 
thinly traded stock in the public market and possible volatility of stock price as approximately of the outstanding on command common stock  is traded on the nasdaq national market as of march  the public market for the occ common stock and the on command corporation warrants may not be subject to an active public market which can be sustained 
further  the stock markets may experience volatility that affects the market prices of companies in ways unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the occ common stock or warrants 
highly competitive in room entertainment industry the hotel in room entertainment industry is highly competitive 
due to the high level of penetration in the united states lodging industry already achieved by participants in the in room entertainment industry and the current rate of construction and expansion of hotel properties in the united states  most of the growth opportunities in the in room entertainment industry currently involve securing contracts to serve hotels that are already being served by a competing vendor  expanding internationally and broadening the range of services provided 
these circumstances have led to increasing competition for contract renewals  particularly at hotels operated by major hotel chains 
there can be no assurance that on command corporation will obtain new contracts with hotels currently served by other vendors or that on command corporation will be able to retain contracts with the hotels served by ocv and spectravision when those contracts expire 
the loss by on command corporation of one or more of the major hotel chain customers  such as marriott  hyatt  holiday inn or hilton  could have a material adverse impact on on command corporation s results of operations 
see dependence on significant customers 
in addition  there are a number of potential competitors that could utilize their existing infrastructure to provide in room entertainment to the lodging industry  including cable companies including wireless cable  telecommunications companies  and direct to home and direct broadcast satellite companies 
some of these potential competitors already are providing free to guest services to hotels and testing video on demand 
some of these potential competitors have substantially greater resources than on command corporation 
dependence on significant customers marriott  holiday inn and hilton accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of on command corporation s revenues for the year ended december  the loss of any of these customers  or the loss of a significant number of other hotel chain customers  could have a material adverse effect on on command corporation s results of operations or financial condition 
however  these customers represent both chain owned managed hotels  as well as franchisees 
the company often has different contracts on different terms with the chain owned managed hotels  on the one hand  and with the franchisees or groups of franchisees  on the other 
dependence on performance of lodging industry on command s business is closely linked to the performance of the hotel industry in which overall occupancy has been declining recently  though not as significantly as many of the luxury and business hotels served by occ 
declines in hotel occupancy as a result of general business  economic  seasonal and other factors can have a significant adverse impact on on command corporation s results of operations 
risk of technological obsolescence technology in the entertainment and communications industry is continuously changing as new technologies and developments continue to be introduced 
there can be no assurance that future technological advances will not result in improved equipment or software systems that could adversely affect on command corporation s competitive position 
in order to remain competitive  on command corporation must maintain the programming enhancements  engineering and technical capability and flexibility to respond to customer demands for new or improved versions of its systems and new technological developments  and there can be no assurance that on command corporation will have the financial or technological resources to be successful in doing so 
dependence on key personnel on command corporation s success will be dependent upon the contributions of its executive officers  especially brian ac steel  its president  and chief operating officer 
the loss of the services of such executive officers could have a material adverse effect on on command corporation 
on command corporation s success also depends on its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that on command corporation or its subsidiaries will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
mr 
steel has entered into an employment agreement with on command corporation through seasonality the business of on command corporation is seasonal  with higher revenues per room realized during the summer months and lower revenues per room realized during the winter months due to business and vacation travel patterns 
anti takeover protections ascent owns approximately of the occ common stock at december   before giving effect to the exercise of any warrants 
accordingly  on command corporation will not be able to engage in any strategic transactions without the approval of ascent 
even if ascent s interest in on command corporation were reduced below such level  on command corporation s certificate of incorporation contains certain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  control of on command corporation 
such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of occ common stock 
certain of such provisions allow on command corporation to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the occ common stock and impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
programming the cost to the company to license feature movies from major movie studios is subject to change as the major movie studios continue to negotiate for higher royalty rates as well as higher minimum payments by the company 
such changes may have adverse impacts on the company s earnings 
while the company intends to address such trends  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will prove effective 
year the year issue is the result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the application year  such that computer programs that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities for both the company and its customers who rely on its products 
the company is actively engaged  but has not yet completed  reviewing  correcting and testing all of the year compliance issues 
based on the current review and remediation  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace some of its internally developed it software products 
the company utilizes embedded technology in all of its hotel system design 
the company s engineering department has completed the majority of its evaluation process and is currently developing solutions to the year issues affecting the hotel systems 
in addition  the company has also determined that it will be required to modify and or replace certain third party software so that it will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with the proper modifications  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company or its customers 
the company is currently on schedule to complete all year issues by june however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the company and its customers 
the total cost to the company for addressing its year issues is estimated to be less than million with less than  incurred through december  the costs of year compliance and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions including third parties year readiness and other factors 
the company has and will continue to have communications with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable in the event that those parties fail to properly address their own year issues 
the company has taken steps to monitor the progress made by those parties  and intends to test critical system interfaces  as the year approaches 
there is some unknown level of risk based upon the compliance issue affecting a given hotel  and generally this should be limited to a specific hotel 
conditions that make a hotel unable to take in guests would affect the company s revenue 
a large number of the company s systems are interfaced with the hotel s property management system 
if this interface fails all movie charges will require manual processing 
processes to perform this are in place in all hotels and are occasionally utilized at times when the property management system interface is not functioning 
this typically causes a slightly higher number of lost charges  which could be material if applied to a large number of customers 
while the company has not completed a formal contingency plan for the year problem  it has evaluated several anticipated scenarios for failures affecting both its critical business systems and hotel systems 
it is management s opinion that any of the potential scenarios can be managed by manual means  although less efficient  while the necessary corrective action is taken 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of third parties on which the company relies will be corrected in a timely manner  that manual processing of the company s movie charges would be accomplished  or that the failure to properly convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition  particularly  the company s interest expense and cash flow 
the company does not hedge this exposure 
revolving loans extended under the credit facility generally bear an interest rate that is variable and based on the london interbank offering rate libor and on certain operating ratios of the company 
at december   the company had million outstanding on the credit facility and the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility was 
assuming no increase or decrease in the amount outstanding  a hypothetical immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates at december  would increase or decrease  the company s annual interest expense and cash outflow by approximately million
