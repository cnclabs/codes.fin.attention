item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations offshore marine services the company provides marine transportation and related services largely dedicated to supporting offshore oil and gas exploration and production through the operation  domestically and internationally  of offshore support vessels 
the company s vessels deliver cargo and personnel to offshore installations  tow and handle the anchors of drilling rigs and other marine equipment  support offshore construction and maintenance work  and provide standby safety support 
the company s vessels also are used for special projects  such as well stimulation  seismic data gathering  freight hauling  line handling  salvage  and oil spill emergencies 
operating revenues are affected primarily by the number of vessels owned  average rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet  and the number of vessels bareboat and time chartered in 
since  acquisition transactions and investments in joint ventures that have significantly increased the size of the company s fleet include i utility  crew  and supply vessels acquired in the graham transaction  ii towing and anchor handling towing supply vessels acquired in the and cnn transactions  iii crew and utility vessels acquired in the mccall transaction  iv anchor handling towing supply  supply  and towing supply vessels acquired and equity investments in joint ventures that owned anchor handling towing supply and towing supply vessels pursuant to the smit transaction  v utility  crew  and supply vessels acquired in the galaxie transaction  and vi anchor handling towing supply  crew  and supply vessels constructed during and the vessels acquired in the graham transaction  the mccall transaction  and the galaxie transaction and the vessels constructed primarily support the oil and gas exploration and production industry in the us gulf of mexico  whereas  vessels acquired in the and cnn transactions and the smit transaction are employed in foreign offshore support markets 
the company also actively monitors opportunities to buy and sell vessels that will maximize the overall utility and flexibility of its fleet 
since  the company has sold vessels i utility  ii supply  iii towing supply  iv anchor handling towing supply  v crew  vi freight  and vii seismic 
nineteen of the vessels sold have subsequently been bareboat chartered in by the company 
the company is also committed to the construction of vessels over the next two years that include crew  anchor handling towing supply  utility  and supply 
rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet are a function of demand for and availability of marine vessels that is closely aligned with the level of exploration and development of offshore areas 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices which  in turn  are related to the demand for petroleum products and the current availability of oil and gas resources 
the table below sets forth rates per day worked and utilization data for the company during the periods indicated 
year ended december  rates per day worked supply towing supply    anchor handling towing supply    crew    standby safety    utility line handling    geophysical  freight and other    overall fleet    overall utilization supply towing supply anchor handling towing supply crew standby safety utility line handling geophysical  freight and other overall fleet rates per day worked is the ratio of total charter revenue to the total number of vessel days worked 
rates per day worked and overall utilization figures exclude owned vessels that are bareboat chartered out  vessels owned by corporations that participate in pooling arrangements with the company  joint venture vessels and managed operated vessels and include vessels bareboat and time chartered in by the company 
revenues for certain of the company s vessels  primarily its standby safety vessels  are earned in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds sterling  and have been converted to us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the periods indicated 
from time to time  the company bareboat or time charters in vessels 
a bareboat charter is a vessel lease under which the lessee charterer is responsible for all crewing  insurance  and other operating expenses  as well as the payment of bareboat charter hire to the providing entity 
a time charter is a lease under which the entity providing the vessel is responsible for all crewing  insurance  and other operating expenses and the charterer only pays a time charter hire fee to the providing entity 
operating revenues for vessels owned and bareboat or time chartered in are incurred at similar rates 
however  operating expenses associated with vessels bareboat and time chartered in include charter hire expenses that  in turn  are included in vessel expenses  but exclude depreciation expense 
the company also bareboat charters out vessels 
operating revenues for these vessels are lower than for vessels owned and operated or bareboat chartered in by the company  because vessel expenses  normally recovered through charter revenue  are the burden of the charterer 
operating expenses include depreciation expense if the vessels which are chartered out are owned 
at december   the company had nine vessels bareboat chartered out 
the table below sets forth the company s fleet structure at the dates indicated 
at december  fleet structure owned bareboat and time chartered in managed joint venture vessels pool vessels overall fleet   and include  and vessels  respectively  operated by the tmm joint venture 
additionally  and include vessels operated by the smit joint venture  and includes and vessels operated by the smit joint ventures and other joint venture businesses  respectively 
at december   company owned vessels were additionally chartered out to and operated by the tmm joint venture

  and include seavec pool vessels and saint fleet pool vessels 
see business joint ventures and pooling arrangements 
vessel operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant vessel operating expense items are wages paid to marine personnel  maintenance  and repairs and marine insurance 
in addition to variable vessel operating expenses  the offshore marine business also incurs fixed charges related to the depreciation of property and equipment 
depreciation is a significant operating cost  and the amount related to vessels is the most significant component 
a portion of the company s revenues and expenses are paid in foreign currencies 
for financial statement reporting purposes  these amounts are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates during the relevant period 
the foregoing applies primarily to the company s north sea operations 
overall  the percentage of the company s offshore marine revenues derived from foreign operations  whether in us dollars or foreign currencies  approximated for the fiscal year ended december  the company s foreign offshore marine operations are subject to various risks inherent in conducting business in foreign nations 
these risks include  among others  political instability  potential vessel seizure  nationalization of assets  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
although  historically  the company s operations have not been affected materially by such conditions or events  it is not possible to predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future 
the occurrence of any one or more of such conditions or events could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory drydockings  which are a substantial component of marine maintenance and repair costs  are expensed when incurred 
under applicable maritime regulations  vessels must be drydocked twice in a five year period for inspection and routine maintenance and repair 
the company follows an asset management strategy pursuant to which it defers required drydocking of selected marine vessels and voluntarily removes these marine vessels from operation during periods of weak market conditions and low rates per day worked 
should the company undertake a large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year  or put through survey a disproportionate number of older vessels  which typically have higher drydocking costs  comparative results may be affected 
for the years ended december    and  drydocking costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
during those same periods the company completed the drydocking of   and marine vessels  respectively 
as of december   the average age of the company s owned offshore marine service fleet was approximately years 
the company believes that after offshore marine service vessels have been in service for approximately years years for crewboats  the amount of expenditures which typically increase with vessel age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels or acquiring new or used vessels  or that the company s financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make capital expenditures for such purposes 
operating results are also affected by the company s participation in the following joint ventures i the veesea joint venture which operated standby safety vessels in the north sea at december   ii the seavec and saint fleet pools which coordinate the marketing of standby safety vessels in the north sea  of which are owned by the veesea joint venture at december   iii the tmm joint venture which operated vessels in mexico at december   iv the smit joint ventures which operated vessels in the far east  latin america  the middle east  and the mediterranean at december   v the vision joint venture which operated one vessel in latin america at december   and vi other joint venture operations

environmental services the company s environmental service business provides contractual oil spill response and other related training and consulting services 
the company s clients include tank vessel owner operators  refiners and terminal operators  exploration and production facility operators  and pipeline operators 
the company charges a retainer fee to its customers for ensuring by contract the availability at predetermined rates of its response services and equipment 
retainer services include employing a staff to supervise response to an oil spill emergency and maintaining specialized equipment  including marine equipment  in a ready state for emergency and spill response as contemplated by response plans filed by the company s customers in accordance with opa and various state regulations 
the company maintains relationships with numerous environmental sub contractors to assist with response operations  equipment maintenance  and provide trained personnel for deploying equipment in a spill response 
pursuant to retainer agreements entered into with the company  certain vessel owners pay in advance to the company an annual retainer fee based upon the number and size of vessels in each such owner s fleet and in some circumstances pay the company additional fees based upon the level of each vessel owner s voyage activity in the us the company recognizes the greater of revenue earned by voyage activity or the portion of the retainer earned in each accounting period 
certain vessel and facility owners pay a fixed fee or a fee based on volume of petroleum product transported for the company s retainer services and such fee is recognized ratably throughout the year 
the company s retainer agreements with vessel owners generally range from one to three years while retainer arrangements with facility owners are as long as seven years 
spill response revenue is dependent on the magnitude of any one spill response and the number of spill responses within a given fiscal period 
consequently  spill response revenue can vary greatly between comparable periods and the revenue from any one period is not indicative of a trend or of anticipated results in future periods 
costs of oil spill response activities relate primarily to i payments to sub contractors for labor  equipment and materials  ii direct charges to the company for equipment and materials  iii participation interests of others in gross profits from oil spill response  and iv training and exercises related to spill response preparedness 
the company charges consulting fees to customers for customized training programs  its planning of and participation in customer oil spill response drill programs and response exercises  and other special projects 
the principal components of the company s operating costs are salaries and related benefits for operating personnel  payments to sub contractors  equipment maintenance  and depreciation 
these expenses are primarily a function of regulatory requirements and the level of retainer business 
operating results are also affected by nrc s participation in cpa on the west coast of the united states 
drilling services the company s drilling service business  conducted through chiles offshore  has operated as a development stage company since inception in by devoting substantially all of its efforts to designing  engineering  and contracting with shipyards and vendors for the rigs  raising capital  and securing contracts for the rigs 
drilling operations have not generated operating revenues  nor is there any assurance that it will generate significant operating revenues in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s drilling service business will successfully complete the transition from a development stage company to successful operations 
additional risk factors associated with the company s drilling service business includes  but are not limited to  oil and gas prices  capital expenditure plans of oil and gas operators  access to capital  completion of construction of the rigs  and competition 
as a result of the aforementioned factors and the related uncertainties  there can be no assurance of the company s drilling service business future success 
results of operations the following table sets forth operating revenue and operating profit by the company s various business segments  in thousands of dollars 
the company evaluates the performance of each operating segment based upon the operating profit of the segment including gains from the sale of equipment and interest in or less owned companies and equity in the net income of or less owned companies but excluding minority interest  interest income and expense  gains from the sale of marketable securities and commodity swap transactions  corporate expenses  and income taxes

the company considers long lived assets to be property and equipment that has been distributed to geographical areas based upon the assets physical location during the applicable period 
certain of the company s offshore marine service segment s long lived vessel assets relocate between its geographical areas of operation 
the costs of long lived vessel assets that are relocated have been allocated between geographical areas of operation based upon length of service in the applicable region

domestic revenue rose due to improvements in rates per day worked and vessel acquisitions partially offset by vessel dispositions  a decline in the utilization of supply towing supply  crewboats  and utility vessels  and the relocation of vessels to work offshore west africa and in other foreign regions 
revenues earned from the company s operations offshore west africa rose due primarily to the relocation of vessels into the region  improved rates per day worked  additional chartered in vessels  and vessel acquisitions partially offset by vessel dispositions 
revenues earned from the company s operations in the far east and latin america rose due primarily to higher rates per day worked  additional chartered in vessels  and vessel acquisitions offset by vessel dispositions and the relocation of equipment to offshore west africa 
revenues earned from the company s operations in the north sea declined due to vessel dispositions and the relocation of vessels to other foreign regions offset by the effect of higher rates per day worked 
operating revenue of the company s environmental service business increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to oil spill  retainer  and other service revenue earned during as a result of the company s acquisition of erst in october operating profit of the company s offshore marine service business increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the increase was due to factors affecting operating revenue as outlined above offset by higher costs associated with i crew wages  ii administration as discussed below  iii repairs and maintenance  iv bareboat and time charters in  v a vessel construction contract cancellation  and vi crew travel 
domestic and foreign crew wages rose in response to competition for qualified personnel in an active offshore market 
main engine and hull repair costs rose primarily in response to greater running time of the company s crewboats 
electronic and communication costs rose due to the installation and use of additional communication equipment aboard vessels working domestically and in foreign regions 
bareboat charter expense rose domestically in connection with the company s sale and leaseback of vessels 
charter expense also rose in foreign operations due to the addition of vessels to the company s fleet 
certain fees and expenses were incurred domestically pursuant to the cancellation of a contract for the construction of a supply vessel 
crew travel expenses rose due primarily to the relocation of vessels from domestic to foreign markets and an increase in the frequency of crew rotation aboard other vessels working offshore west africa 
these cost increases were offset by a decline in domestic drydocking expenses due primarily to the disposition and drydock deferral of certain vessels 
operating profit of the company s environmental service business increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  in addition to including the results of erst  which was acquired in october  operating profits rose due to reduced operating costs 
since inception  the company s drilling service business has engaged in no operations other than managing construction of the rigs and related matters 
the company has not generated any operating revenues to date 
the drilling service business operating loss was million in the twelve month period ending december  as a result of general and administrative and depreciation expenses 
overall administrative and general expenses  relating primarily to operating activities  increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the increase was due primarily to i higher offshore marine service segment costs  ii the acquisition of erst in october  and iii the acquisition of a majority equity interest in chiles in december in  the offshore marine service business added staff in support of the company s operations in west africa and other foreign regions and experienced increases in wage costs due to heightened competition for administrative personnel in the domestic labor market 
corporate administrative expenses also increased between the comparable twelve month periods due to higher wage and legal costs 
an increase in the environmental service segment s administrative costs due to the acquisition of erst during was partially offset by a decline in administrative expenses incurred by nrc 
administrative and general expenses primarily include costs associated with personnel  professional services  travel  communications  facility rental and maintenance  general insurance  and franchise taxes 
net gains from equipment sales and retirements decreased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  during  net gains from equipment sales and retirements aggregated million  resulting primarily from the sale of offshore marine vessels towing supply of which were bareboat chartered in  anchor handling towing supply of which were bareboat chartered in  utility  supply of which were bareboat chartered in and crew 
during  net gains from equipment sales and retirements aggregated million  resulting primarily from the sale of offshore marine vessels supply of which were bareboat chartered in  towing supply  anchor handling towing supply of which was bareboat chartered in  utility  crew  freight  and seismic 
the decrease in gains between comparable periods was due primarily to a decline in the number of offshore marine vessels sold and the increase in the deferral of gains associated with sale and leaseback transactions 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  gains from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred to the extent of the present value of minimum lease payments and are credited to income as a reduction in rental expense over the applicable lease terms 
equity earnings from or less owned companies increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the increase primarily related to a and million gain from the sale of an offshore marine vessel by the tmm joint venture and the smit joint ventures  respectively 
the tmm joint venture s earnings also rose due to fleet expansion and higher revenues earned by offshore marine vessels operating between comparable years 
gain from the sale of the company s investment in a or less owned company increased million in the twelve month period ending december  compared to the twelve month period ending december  during  the company sold its equity interest in a joint venture entity which provided marine and underwater services to offshore terminal and oilfield operations internationally 
there was no comparable disposition of an equity interest in a or less owned company during minority interest in income of subsidiaries of the company increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to the commencement of operations in june of the vision joint venture 
interest income increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to greater invested cash balances that resulted from i the sale in september of the company s notes  ii the sale of offshore marine vessels  iii the sale in april of the chiles notes  and iv the continuing strong results of operations 
interest expense increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to the i sale in september of the notes  ii sale in april of the chiles notes  and iii amortization of debt discount recognized on indebtedness issued pursuant to the smit additional consideration transaction 
the increase in interest expense was partially offset by the capitalization of interest costs in connection with the construction of offshore marine vessels and the rigs 
gains from commodity swap transactions increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  during  the company entered into natural gas commodity swap transactions that resulted in the recognition of a net gain 
there were no comparable commodity swap transactions during the prior year 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional discussion of the company s commodity swap activities 
gains from the sale of marketable securities increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to twelve month period ended december  during  the company sold certain available for sale securities that resulted in net gains from those transactions 
no available for sale securities were sold during the prior year 
the company s overall depreciation and amortization expense  relating primarily to operating activities  did not change significantly between the comparable twelve month periods ending december  and a decline in depreciation expense due to offshore marine vessel sales was offset primarily by higher expense associated with depreciating newly constructed and acquired offshore marine vessels  additional offshore marine vessel purchase consideration paid in the smit additional consideration transaction  and amortizing goodwill associated with the acquisition of erst 
comparison of year end to year end operating revenue of the company s offshore marine service business increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to a net increase in the number of owned vessels and a significant improvement in rates per day worked for the company s offshore vessels operating in the us gulf of mexico 
significant offshore vessel acquisitions included vessels purchased from smit during december that operate in the north sea  offshore west africa  and in other foreign regions and vessels purchased from galaxie during january that operate in the us gulf of mexico 
anchor handling towing supply  towing supply  and supply vessels were acquired from smit  and utility  crew  and supply vessels were acquired from galaxie 
strong demand in the us gulf of mexico resulted in rates per day worked increasing between comparable periods for all offshore vessels owned by the company 
additionally  rates per day worked for the company s vessels operating in the north sea  offshore west africa  and in other foreign regions also increased between comparable periods 
operating revenue of the company s environmental service business decreased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to a decline in the severity of oil spills managed by the company 
retainer fees and other service revenues also declined between comparable periods due primarily to a decline in voyage and other service activities 
operating profit of the company s offshore marine service business increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the increase was due primarily to factors affecting operating revenue as outlined above 
these increases in operating profit were partially offset by higher wage  repair  insurance  charter  food provision  and administrative costs see discussion below 
wage costs increased for seaman working in the us gulf of mexico region in response to strong demand for personnel resulting from very active market conditions 
repair costs increased for the company s fleet operating in the us gulf of mexico due primarily to an increase in i the number of scheduled engine overhauls  ii other engine maintenance resulting from greater running time by the company s smaller vessels  and iii drydock expenses that resulted from rising shipyard costs and more stringent regulatory inspections 
health insurance costs in the united states increased due to higher per average employee claim costs 
charter cost increased due to the sale and leaseback of eight vessels during the food provision per diem for vessels operating domestically was increased in operating profit of the company s environmental service business declined million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to the factors affecting operating revenue as outlined above 
these declines in operating profit were partially offset by decreases in both operating and general and administrative expenses 
the company s overall administrative and general expenses  relating primarily to operating activities  increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  and related primarily to an increase in managerial staff and other administrative costs necessary to support fleet growth in the offshore marine service segment that includes the recent vessel acquisitions from smit and galaxie 
also during  the company s marine service business increased its reserve for doubtful foreign trade accounts receivable 
administrative and general expenses of the environmental service business decreased in response to reduced voyage and other service activities 
administrative and general expenses primarily include costs associated with personnel  professional services  travel  communications  facility rental and maintenance  general insurance  and franchise taxes 
net gains from equipment sales and retirements increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  during  net gains from equipment sales and retirements aggregated million  primarily from the sale of offshore marine vessels supply of which were bareboat chartered in by the company  towing supply  anchor handling towing supply of which was bareboat chartered in by the company  utility  crew  freight  and seismic 
during  net gains from equipment sales and retirements aggregated million  primarily from the sale of utility vessels 
the increase in gains between comparable periods was due primarily to the number and types of offshore marine vessels sold 
interest income increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to greater invested cash balances that resulted from improved operating results and the sale of the company s notes and notes 
interest expense increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to an increase in the company s outstanding indebtedness offset by the capitalization in of certain interest costs associated with the construction of offshore marine vessels 
equity earnings from or less owned companies increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the increase in equity earnings between the periods was due primarily to operating profits earned by the smit joint ventures that were acquired in december pursuant to the smit transaction and improved operating results of cpa 
the company s overall depreciation and amortization expense  which related primarily to operating activities  increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  this increase was due primarily to a net increase in the number of owned offshore marine vessels that were acquired from smit and galaxie 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the company s ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from its need to service debt  fund working capital  acquire  construct  or improve equipment and make other investments 
management believes that cash flow from operations will provide sufficient working capital to fund the company s operating needs 
the company may  from time to time  issue shares of common stock  its preferred stock  debt  or a combination thereof  or sell vessels to finance the acquisition of equipment and businesses or make improvements to existing equipment 
the company s cash flow levels and operating revenues are determined primarily by the size of the company s offshore marine fleet  rates per day worked and overall utilization of the company s offshore marine vessels  and retainer  spill response  and consulting activities of the company s environmental service business 
factors relating to the marine service business are affected directly by the volatility of oil and gas prices  the level of offshore production and exploration activity  and other factors beyond the company s control 
offshore market developments 
the decline in oil and gas prices that began in has resulted in reduced drilling and production support activities both domestically and internationally 
as a result  revenue earned by the company s offshore marine service fleet has declined  and during march  the company had offshore marine vessels out of service in the us gulf of mexico 
lower oil and gas prices have also resulted in reduced day rates and decreased utilization of jackup rigs  particularly in the us gulf of mexico shallow water market  and excess supply in the current jackup market 
sustained weak commodity prices  economic problems in countries outside the united states  or a number of other factors beyond the company s control could further curtail spending by oil and gas companies 
therefore  the company cannot predict whether  or to what extent  market conditions will improve or deteriorate further 
the current trends in market conditions will have an adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company believes that chiles has sufficient financing in place to complete the construction and outfitting of the rigs and fund the initial cost of operations 
current day rate levels for jackup rigs are  however  not sufficient for chiles to operate the rigs at cash flow levels necessary to provide for adequate debt service coverage 
accordingly  if jackup rig day rates remain depressed  it will be necessary for chiles to obtain additional financing in the form of subordinated debt or equity 
the company believes that chiles will be able to obtain such financing  if required  however  there can be no assurance that it will be available on acceptable terms 
cash and marketable securities 
at december   the company s cash and investments in marketable securities totaled million  including million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in marketable securities  and million of restricted cash 
the company s cash and investments in marketable securities rose between years by million for the twelve month period ending december  compared to the twelve month period ending december   see discussion below regarding cash generation and deployment 
restricted cash at december  includes million and million that is intended for use in defraying the costs of constructing offshore marine vessels for the company and the rigs and other related matters for chiles  respectively 
at december   the company has funded approximately million in offshore marine vessel construction costs from unrestricted cash balances  and subject to the maritime administration s approval  the company expects such amounts to be reimbursed from construction reserve fund restricted cash accounts as discussed below 
proceeds from the sale of certain offshore marine vessels in and have been deposited into escrow and construction reserve fund bank accounts for purposes of acquiring newly constructed us flag vessels and qualifying for the company s temporary deferral of taxable gains realized from the sale of the vessels 
escrow accounts were established pursuant to certain exchange and escrow agreements and restrict the use of funds deposited therein for a period of six months 
should replacement offshore marine vessels not be delivered prior to expiration of the applicable six month escrow period  funds then remaining in the escrow accounts will be released to the company for general use 
in  the company also established  pursuant to section of the merchant marine act   as amended  joint depository construction reserve fund accounts with the maritime administration 
from the date of deposit  withdrawals from these accounts are subject to prior written approval of the maritime administration  and funds must be committed for expenditure within three years or they will be released for the company s general use 
net proceeds from the sale of the chiles notes were deposited into escrow accounts in accordance with certain escrow agreements between chiles and us bank trust national association  as escrow agent 
these funds may be used to i partially fund the construction of the rigs  ii pay interest on the chiles notes through the first two semi annual interest payment dates  and iii provide working capital 
upon receipt by the escrow agent of an officer s certificate of chiles that chiles has made the final installment of the rigs purchase price in accordance with the related construction contracts  any funds remaining in escrow will be released by the escrow agent to chiles 
investments in marketable securities at december   totaling million  were primarily comprised of us government and related government agencies securities and also included a relatively small amount of corporate debt  debt securities of the government of the united kingdom  and equity securities 
all of these securities are publicly traded and highly liquid instruments  and the company does not believe that this portfolio contains material market risks 
capital structure 
at december   the company s capital structure was comprised of million in long term debt including current portion and million in stockholders equity 
long term debt rose during the year from the issuance of the chiles notes and completion of the smit additional consideration transaction 
stockholders equity rose due to an increase in retained earnings of million from net income and common stock and paid in capital of million primarily from the exercise of stock options  the issuance of common stock in connection with the acquisition of erst that occurred in  and amortization of restricted stock 
million of common stock repurchases and a million decline in accumulated other comprehensive income offset these increases 
cash generation and deployment 
at december   cash and cash equivalents were relatively unchanged from the prior year end 
cash flow provided from operating activities increased million due primarily to improved rates per day earned by vessels in the offshore marine service business 
in  cash generated from investing and financing activities primarily included million from the sale or maturity of marketable securities  million from the sale of offshore marine vessels and other equipment  and million of net proceeds generated from the sale of the chiles notes 
these increases in cash flow were primarily offset by uses in investing and financing activities to acquire million of property and equipment  million of marketable securities and other investments  and million of common stock  and to increase restricted cash balances by million and repay million of indebtedness 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for property and equipment totaled million  million and million in   and  respectively 
during each of those years  expenditures for property and equipment primarily related to the company s acquisition  construction  and improvement of offshore marine vessels  and capital expenditures in additionally included costs incurred in connection with the construction of two rigs 
the company has substantially expanded the size of its offshore marine vessel fleet over the past several years  and its construction program that began in reflects a continuing commitment to serving the offshore oil and gas industry with equipment well suited for deep water drilling and production activities 
as of december   the company has commitments to build offshore marine service vessels at an approximate aggregate cost of million of which million has been expended  and its majority owned subsidiary  chiles  has commitments to build two rigs for million of which million has been expended 
completion of these construction projects is expected during the next two years 
the company may make selective acquisitions of offshore marine vessels or fleets of offshore marine vessels and oil spill response equipment or expand the scope and nature of its environmental services 
the company also may upgrade or enhance its offshore marine vessels or construct offshore marine vessels to remain competitive in the marketplace 
management anticipates that such expenditures would be funded through a combination of existing cash balances  cash flow provided by operations  sale of existing equipment and  potentially  through the issuance of additional indebtedness  shares of common stock  or the company s preferred stock 
other investments 
at december   the company had an equity investment in and loans to  aggregating million  globe wireless  inc globe wireless  a telecommunication service provider dedicated to the maritime industry 
the investment  carried at cost and totaling million  was in the form of series c convertible preferred stock  
par value series c preferred stock 
loans  totaling million  bear interest at the applicable libor rate plus payable quarterly  are repayable in  and are secured by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of globe wireless 
subject to and upon the terms and conditions contained in an amended and restated loan agreement dated as of april  between the company and globe wireless  the company has agreed to loan to globe wireless up to an additional million 
subject to certain conditions  the company may exercise certain warrants to purchase up to an amount of the series c preferred stock  equal to the principal amount of the loans outstanding  as repayment of the loans

at december   the company had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of its notes that were issued pursuant to a private placement and the smit transaction in the notes were issued under an indenture dated as of november   the indenture  between the company and first trust national association  as trustee 
the notes are convertible  in whole or part  at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day next preceding november   unless previously redeemed into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share equivalent to a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the notes are redeemable at the company s option at any time on or after november  at the redemption prices specified therein  together with accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date 
the notes are general unsecured obligations of the company  subordinated in right of payment to all senior indebtedness as defined in the indenture of the company and effectively subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other obligations and liabilities and any preferred stock of the company s subsidiaries 
also  pursuant to the smit transaction  the company entered into certain lease purchase agreements which obligate the company to purchase two vessels from smit with cash and million principal amount of the notes in disclosure about market risks 
the company s operating revenues are primarily earned from its operation of offshore marine service vessels and net income can vary significantly with fluctuations in the average rate per day worked or utilization of that equipment 
assuming operating activities comparable to fiscal year  each change in the average rate per day worked would have an approximate million effect on operating revenues and an approximate million effect on net income 
also assuming operating activities comparable to fiscal year  each change in utilization would have an approximate million effect on operating revenues and an approximate million effect on net income 
should changes in rates per day worked and utilization have an adverse effect on the company s results of operation and cash flows  certain actions may be taken by management to mitigate the impact through cost reduction measures that include but are not limited to the deferral of vessel drydockings and repairs or the removal of vessels from service 
the company has foreign currency exchange risks primarily related to its offshore marine service vessel operations that are conducted from ports located in the united kingdom where its functional currency is pounds sterling 
the financial statements of the company s united kingdom operations are measured using the pound sterling and changes in the strength of that currency relative to the us dollar and the corresponding adjustment to the net assets of those operations caused by exchange rate fluctuations result in the recognition of currency translation adjustments that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
to protect certain of the us dollar value of pound sterling denominated net assets of the company from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their conversion to us dollars  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts 
the forward exchange contracts enable the company to sell pounds sterling in the future at fixed exchange rates to offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange on the amount of us dollar cash flows to be derived from the net assets 
the company considers these forward exchange contracts as economic hedges of a net investment as the translation adjustments resulting from the forward exchange contracts move in the opposite direction from the translation adjustments resulting from the restatement of its united kingdom subsidiaries net assets 
at december   the notional and fair value of those forward exchange contracts  which expire at various dates through january  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate of the company s forward exchange contracts at december  was approximately 
pounds sterling per us dollar 
the company also collects certain revenues and pays certain expenses in other foreign currencies 
with respect to these foreign currency risks  the company has not entered into hedging contracts and its operating results are positively or negatively affected as these foreign currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar 
the market risks associated with these other foreign currencies have not been material 
the rates that the company is able to charge customers for its fleet of offshore marine vessels and those that it expects to charge for the rigs under construction and  consequently  the earnings and cash flows from such operations are in large part dependent upon natural gas prices 
in an effort to achieve greater predictability with respect to such cash flows and earnings and to mitigate the effects that the volatility of the price of natural gas will have on its operations  the company has in the past and may in the future hedge against the risks associated with movements in natural gas prices through the use of commodity futures  options  swap agreements  and other hedge devices 
the use of these hedging arrangements is intended to limit the risk of a decline in market rates for offshore vessels and the rigs  which typically follow a decline in natural gas prices 
these arrangements  however  may also mitigate the favorable effect on earnings and cash flows of increased rates  which typically follow an increase in natural gas prices 
beginning in  the company entered into commodity price swap agreements pursuant to which  on each applicable settlement date  the company receives the amount  if any  by which the contract price for the notional quantity of natural gas under contract exceeds the settlement price quoted on the new york mercantile exchange nymex or pays the amount  if any  by which the settlement price quoted on the nymex exceeds the contract price 
as of december   the company had entered into various commodity price swap agreements based on  million british thermal units mmbtu of natural gas per day at an average price of per mmbtu under commodity swap transactions that expire at various dates through december for accounting purposes  the change in the market value of the company s natural gas commodity price swap agreements is recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change

minority interest includes the interest of the company s partners in the net worth of primarily three joint ventures chiles  the veesea joint venture  and the vision joint venture 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair market value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair market value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may also implement sfas as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance that is  fiscal quarters beginning june  and thereafter 
sfas must be applied to derivative instruments and certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantially modified after december  the company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas on its financial statements and has not determined the timing or method of its adoption of sfas year the year yk issue is the result of computerized systems being written to store and process the year portion of dates using two digits rather than four and that date sensitive systems may fail or produce erroneous results on or before january  because the year will be interpreted incorrectly 
the company has been pursuing a strategy to ensure that all of its significant computer systems will be able to process dates from and after january  without critical failure 
computerized systems are integral to the company s operations  particularly for accounting and office product software applications used throughout its many offices and  to a lesser extent  for communication  navigational and other systems aboard certain of the company s vessels 
most of the company s computerized accounting and office product software applications are licensed through commercial third party software developers with whom the company has maintenance contracts 
where necessary  these software developers have already modified and released newer versions of their product that are yk compliant 
the company has implemented or is in the process of testing and evaluating these newer yk compliant versions 
in connection with the acquisition of accounting applications in prior years unconnected with its yk planning  the company has already upgraded materially all of its computer hardware to systems that are yk compliant 
the company expects to complete the implementation of both yk compliant accounting and office product software and related hardware during the second half of substantially all yk compliant software upgrades have been provided under the terms of the company s maintenance contracts without additional cost 
the company has also substantially completed inventorying and preparing a risk analysis of other date aware systems in its operations that include vessels 
presently  the company estimates the cost of modifying its information technology infrastructure to be yk compliant will be approximately million 
the company s computer systems are not widely integrated with the systems of its suppliers and customers 
a potential yk risk attributable to third parties would be from a temporary disruption in certain materials and services provided by third parties 
major suppliers have been contacted regarding yk compliance  and the company has added yk compliance requirements to all of its purchasing contracts 
at present  the company has not developed a contingency plan to address all areas of risk associated with yk compliance but expects to develop a plan  if needed  beginning in the third quarter of the company is committed to ensuring that it is fully yk ready and believes that  when completed  its plans will adequately address the above mentioned risks 
based upon the yk risk assessment work performed thus far  the company believes the most likely yk related failures would be related to a disruption of materials and services provided by third parties 
although the company does not expect that such disruptions would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance that the company s belief is correct or that its risk assessments are  in fact  accurate 
the company believes that the upgrades to its hardware and software systems  in conjunction with any contingency plans developed prior to january   will permit a transition through that date without significant interruption in its business or operations  however  such assessment is predicated on the timely completion of the above referenced software modifications 
should these modifications and upgrades be delayed or the company s contingency plans fail  the yk issue could have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s vendors  suppliers and other parties with whom the company does business will successfully resolve their yk problems 
in the event of any such failures or other yk failures  there can be no assurance that  despite the company s contingency plans  there will not be a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
european economic and monetary union the company conducts business in the netherlands and france and may conduct business from time to time in other countries which have agreed to join the european economic and monetary union the emu 
the member nations of the emu have agreed to adopt a single currency called the euro 
effective january   a three year transition period for the euro has begun and the conversion rates between the euro and member nations national currencies have been fixed 
business enterprises have the option of switching to the single currency at any time prior to january  the software upgrades of the company s principal financial accounting system necessary to allow for the conduct of business in euros and national currencies during the transition period and entirely in euros thereafter have been provided under the terms of a maintenance contract with its software provider without additional costs 
there may also be other costs relating to the conversion to the euro that the company is unable to accurately estimate or segregate  but the company does not anticipate that such costs will be material 
the company does not anticipate that the conversion to the euro will have a material impact on its future financial condition or results of operations
