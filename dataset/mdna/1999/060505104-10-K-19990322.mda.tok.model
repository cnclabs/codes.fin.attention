o other income totaled billion in  an increase of million over the increase over was due primarily to the million gain from the sale of the manufactured housing lending business and a million gain on the sale of a partial ownership interest in a mortgage company  partially offset by write downs of million of losses associated with the investment in de shaw in the fourth quarter of and other equity investments of million 
other income also includes certain prepayment fees and other fees  net rental income on automobile leases classified as operating leases  servicing and related fees from the consumer finance business  insurance commissions and earnings and bankers acceptances and letters of credit fees

a discussion of the significant components and changes in other noninterest expense in compared to follows o personnel expense increased percent to billion in  primarily due to the acquisitions of nationsbanc montgomery securities  robertson stephens and nationsbanc auto leasing  inc excluding these acquisitions  personnel expense increased by percent over on december   the corporation had approximately  full time equivalent employees compared to approximately  full time equivalent employees on december o marketing expense amounted to million in  a decrease of approximately percent from  reflecting a decline in advertising and promotional expenses 
o professional fees increased million over to million  primarily due to increases in outside legal fees 
o data processing expense increased to million in compared to million in due to increased processing costs associated with the nationsbanc montgomery securities  robertson stephens and nationsbanc auto leasing  inc acquisitions 
o telecommunications expense increased million over to million  mainly due to acquisition and transition efforts  expenses related to the implementation of model bank  a banking platform  and increased call volume 
o general administrative and miscellaneous expense increased to million compared to million in  primarily due to the addition of nationsbanc montgomery securities  robertson stephens and nationsbanc auto leasing  inc year project the following is a year readiness disclosure 
general because computers frequently use only two digits to recognize years  on january   many computer systems  as well as equipment that uses embedded computer chips  may be unable to distinguish between and if not remediated  this problem could create system errors and failures resulting in the disruption of normal business operations 
since the year is a leap year  there could also be business disruptions as a result of the inability of many computer systems to recognize february  in october and february  respectively  nationsbank and bankamerica established project teams to address these issues 
each of these teams remains in place and continues to work on solving problems related to the year although each of these year teams proceeds according to its respective work plan  they are capitalizing on the best practices of both teams 
going forward  the year efforts of both teams are being integrated 
personnel from the corporation s business segments and project teams have identified and analyzed  and are correcting and testing  computer systems throughout the corporation systems 
personnel have also taken inventory of equipment that uses embedded computer chips ie  non information technology systems or infrastructure and scheduled remediation or replacement of this infrastructure  as necessary 
examples of infrastructure include atms  building security systems  fire alarm systems  identification and access cards  date stamps and elevators 
the nationsbank team tracks systems and infrastructure separately  whereas the bankamerica team tracks systems and infrastructure collectively projects 
for purposes of this section  the information provided for systems and projects is generally provided on a combined basis 
state of readiness the corporation s year efforts are generally divided into phases for analysis  remediation  testing and compliance 
in the analysis phase  the corporation identifies systems projects and infrastructure that have year issues and determines the steps necessary to remediate these issues 
in the remediation phase  the corporation replaces  modifies or retires systems projects or infrastructure  as necessary 
during the testing phase  the corporation performs testing to determine whether the remediated systems projects and infrastructure accurately process and identify dates 
in the compliance phase  the corporation internally certifies the systems projects and infrastructure that are year ready and implements processes to enable these systems projects and infrastructure to continue to identify and process dates accurately through the year and thereafter 
as of december   the nationsbank team has identified over  systems  and the bankamerica team has identified approximately  projects  for a total of approximately  systems projects 
in addition  the nationsbank team has identified over  infrastructure items that may have year implications 
for systems projects  as of december   the analysis and remediation phases were substantially complete  the testing phase was approximately complete and the compliance phase was approximately complete 
for infrastructure  as of december   the analysis phase was approximately complete  the remediation phase was approximately complete  the testing phase was approximately complete and the compliance phase was approximately complete 
the corporation expects to substantially complete all phases by june   in accordance with guidelines established by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
the corporation tracks systems projects and infrastructure for year required changes based on a risk evaluation 
of the identified systems projects and infrastructure  approximately  systems projects and  infrastructure items have been designated mission critical ie  if not made year ready  these systems projects or infrastructure items would substantially impact the normal conduct of business 
for mission critical systems projects  as of december   the analysis and remediation phases were substantially complete  the testing phase was approximately complete and the compliance phase was approximately complete 
the corporation will also perform time machine testing ie  emulate year conditions in a dedicated environment on selected mission critical systems 
for mission critical infrastructure items  as of december   the analysis phase was approximately complete  the remediation phase was approximately complete  the testing phase was approximately complete and the compliance phase was approximately complete 
ultimately  the potential impact of year issues will depend not only on the corrective measures the corporation undertakes  but also on the way in which year issues are addressed by governmental agencies  businesses and other entities which provide data to  or receive data from  the corporation  or whose financial condition or operational capability is important to the corporation as borrowers  vendors  customers  investment opportunities either for the corporation s accounts or for the accounts of others or lenders 
in addition  the corporation s business may be affected by the corrective measures taken by the landlords and managers of buildings leased by the corporation 
accordingly  the corporation is communicating with certain of these parties to evaluate any potential impact on the corporation 
in particular  the corporation is contacting its service providers and software vendors collectively  vendors and requesting information on their year project plans 
the corporation has designated approximately of these vendors as mission critical 
as of december   the corporation has received assurances that approximately of its vendors  and approximately of its mission critical vendors  are year ready 
at the end of  any vendor which had not provided appropriate documentation  had not responded timely to the corporation s inquiries or did not expect to be year ready until was placed in an at risk category 
as of december   the corporation has placed approximately of its vendors  and approximately of its mission critical vendors  in an at risk category 
in accordance with its contingency plans  the corporation will continue to focus on these at risk mission critical vendors in order to mitigate any potential risk 
the corporation is also tracking the year compliance efforts of certain domestic and foreign agencies involved with payment systems  such as clearing houses  security clearings and central banks 
the corporation has identified of agencies  or  which have neither responded to the corporation s inquiries or which were not year ready as of december  although work involved with the implementation of the euro resulted in some delay with respect to the agencies efforts in this area  the corporation will continue to monitor those agencies of particular concern 
in addition  the corporation has completed year risk assessments for the majority of its commercial credit customers 
for any customers deemed higher risk  on a quarterly basis  the corporation s credit review committee reviews the results of customer assessments prepared by the customers relationship managers 
by july   the corporation will reassess any customers deemed medium risk 
weakness in a borrower s year strategy is part of the overall risk assessment process 
risk ratings and exposure strategy are adjusted as required after consideration of all risk issues 
any impact on the allowance for credit losses is determined through the normal risk rating process 
the corporation is also assessing potential year risks associated with its investment advisory and fiduciary activities 
each investment subsidiary has a defined investment process and is integrating the consideration of year issues into that process 
when making investment decisions or recommendations  the corporation s investment research areas consider the year issue as a factor in their analysis  and may take certain steps to investigate year readiness  such as reviewing ratings  research reports and other publicly available information 
in the fiduciary area  the corporation is assessing year risks for business  real estate  oil and gas  and mineral interests that are held in trust 
following the merger with bankamerica  the corporation identified its significant depositors and assessed the year readiness of these customers 
the corporation will continue to monitor these depositors for purposes of determining any potential liquidity risks to the corporation 
costs the corporation currently estimates the total cost of the year project to be approximately million 
of this amount  the corporation has incurred cumulative year costs of approximately million through december  a significant portion of the foregoing cost is not expected to be incremental to the corporation but instead will constitute a reallocation of existing internal systems technology resources and  accordingly  will be funded from normal operations 
contingency plans the corporation has existing business continuity plans that address its response to disruptions to business due to natural disasters  civil unrest  utility outages or other occurrences 
the corporation is developing business continuity plans specific to year issues that are based on these existing plans 
the corporation has made substantial progress on an inventory and assessment of the existing business contingency plans 
supplements to the existing plans to address year issues are being finalized and will include detailed plans to respond to these events 
the corporation substantially completed these supplemental business continuity plans in january during the remainder of  the business continuity plans are being tested and validated with particular attention to event management and communication processes 
risks although the corporation s remediation efforts are directed at reducing its year exposure  there can be no assurance that these efforts will fully mitigate the effect of year issues and it is likely that one or more events may disrupt the corporation s normal business operations 
in the event the corporation fails to identify or correct a material year problem  there could be disruptions in normal business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that significant foreign and domestic third parties will adequately address their year issues 
further  there may be some such parties  such as governmental agencies  utilities  telecommunication companies  financial services vendors and other providers  where alternative arrangements or resources are not available 
also  risks associated with some foreign third parties may be greater since there is general concern that some entities operating outside the united states are not addressing year issues on a timely basis 
in addition to the foregoing  the corporation is subject to credit risk to the extent borrowers fail to adequately address year issues  to fiduciary risk to the extent fiduciary assets fail to adequately address year issues  and to liquidity risk to the extent of deposit withdrawals and to the extent its lenders are unable to provide the corporation with funds due to year issues 
although it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of these risks at this time  in future years  there may be increases in problem loans  credit losses  losses in the fiduciary business and liquidity problems  as well as the risk of litigation and potential losses from litigation related to the foregoing 
forward looking statements contained in the foregoing year project section should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statements included in the introductory paragraphs under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on pages and economic and monetary unit emu in europe on january   member countries of the european union launched a common legal currency called the euro 
emu monetary policy  including the money supply and official interest rates for the euro  is now under the direction of the european central bank 
during the transition period  january  through january   the old national currencies will remain legal tender as denominations of the euro 
beginning january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued for use in cash transactions  and by july   all legacy currencies will cease to be legal tender 
emu will impact the corporation s payment and clearing systems 
management expects the elimination of national currencies in favor of the single euro currency to reduce cross border barriers to business and reduce the previous competitive advantage of national firms 
the corporation believes that it is favorably positioned to benefit from these changes 
in addition  management believes that the euro conversion presents significant business opportunities for major pan european providers of cash management services  such as the corporation 
the corporation prepared actively for the euro conversion  utilizing a dedicated emu project team to ensure that the corporation s technology and operations were appropriately modified by january  the project team also communicated extensively with the corporation s clients and counterparties regarding the implications of emu and the effect it would have on their business relationships and contracts with the corporation 
the corporation completed the initial redenomination event on january  most of the costs associated with the euro conversion were incurred by the end of fiscal  and these costs have not been material 
such costs have been and will continue to be expensed by the corporation during the period in which they are incurred  and any ongoing costs are not currently anticipated to be material 
the corporation does not expect the formation of the emu to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
income taxes the corporation s income tax expense for and was billion and billion  respectively 
excluding merger related charges  the effective tax rates for and were percent and percent  respectively 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the reorganization of certain subsidiaries of the corporation in note fourteen of the consolidated financial statements on page includes a reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed using the federal statutory rate of percent to actual income tax expense 
balance sheet review and liquidity risk management the corporation utilizes an integrated approach in managing its balance sheet  which includes management of interest rate sensitivity  credit risk  liquidity risk and its capital position 
the average balances discussed below can be derived from table three 
the following discussion addresses changes in average balances in compared to average customer based funds increased billion to billion in compared to average levels for as a percentage of total sources  average customer based funds decreased to percent in from percent in average market based funds increased billion in to billion and comprised a larger portion of total sources of funds at percent in compared to percent in in addition  levels of long term debt increased by billion over  mainly the result of borrowings to fund business development opportunities and to replace debt maturities 
average loans and leases  the corporation s primary use of funds  increased billion to billion during as a percentage of total uses of funds  average loans and leases decreased to percent in from percent in the increase in average loans and leases was due primarily to core loan growth  partially offset by the impact of billion of securitizations in  most of which occurred in the third quarter 
the ratio of average loans and leases to customer based funds was percent for both and average other assets and cash and cash equivalents increased billion to billion in due largely to an increase in derivative dealer assets associated with interest rate fluctuations and goodwill associated mainly with the nationsbanc montgomery securities and nationsbanc auto leasing  inc acquisitions 
the average securities portfolio in increased billion over levels  amounting to percent of total uses of funds in compared to percent in see the following securities section for additional information on the securities portfolio 
cash and cash equivalents were billion on december   a decrease of million from december  during  net cash provided by operating activities was billion  net cash used in investing activities was billion and net cash provided by financing activities was billion 
for further information on cash flows  see the consolidated statement of cash flows on page in the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity is a measure of the corporation s ability to fulfill its cash requirements and is managed by the corporation through its asset and liability management process 
the corporation monitors its assets and liabilities and modifies these positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  coupled with the corporation s ability to raise capital and debt financing  is designed to cover the liquidity needs of the corporation 
management believes that the corporation s sources of liquidity are more than adequate to meet its cash requirements 
the following discussion provides an overview of significant on and off balance sheet components 
securities the securities portfolio serves a primary role in the overall context of balance sheet management by the corporation 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity requirements and on and off balance sheet positions 
the securities portfolio on december  consisted of securities held for investment totaling billion and securities available for sale totaling billion compared to billion and billion  respectively  on december  the increase in available for sale securities reflects the management of the corporation s interest rate sensitivity by adding fixed income assets 
on december  and  the market value of the corporation s securities held for investment reflected net unrealized losses of million and net unrealized gains of million  respectively 
the valuation allowance for securities available for sale and marketable equity securities included in shareholders equity was million on december   reflecting pre tax appreciation of million on debt securities and million on marketable equity securities 
the valuation allowance increased shareholders equity by million on december  the decrease in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to the realization of securities gains during and lower market interest rates at december  the estimated average duration of securities held for investment and securities available for sale portfolios were and  respectively  on december  compared to and  respectively  on december  loans and leases total loans and leases increased approximately percent to billion on december  compared to billion on december  as presented in table three  average total loans and leases increased percent to billion in compared to billion in primarily due to core loan growth  partially offset by the impact of billion of securitizations in and billion of securitizations in average commercial loans increased to billion in compared to billion in  due largely to core loan growth  partially offset by the impact of billion of securitizations in average domestic commercial real estate loans decreased to billion in due mainly to loan sales 
average residential mortgage loans decreased percent to billion in compared to billion in  mainly the result of loan sales and the impact of billion of securitizations in and billion of securitizations in average bankcard and other consumer loans  including direct and indirect consumer loans and home equity loans  decreased million to billion in due primarily to a decrease in bankcard loans  which included the impact of billion of securitizations in  partially offset by an increase in other consumer loans 
a significant source of liquidity for the corporation is the repayments and maturities of loans 
table seven shows selected loan maturity data on december  and indicates that approximately percent of the selected loans had maturities of one year or less 
the securitization and sale of certain loans and the use of loans as collateral in asset backed financing arrangements are also sources of liquidity 
table seven selected loan maturity data december  dollars in millions this table presents the maturity distribution and interest sensitivity of selected loan categories excluding residential mortgage  bankcard  other consumer loans and lease financing

average deposits increased percent in over to billion 
see note seven of the consolidated financial statements on page for further details on deposits 
short term borrowings and trading account liabilities the corporation uses short term borrowings as a funding source and in its management of interest rate risk 
table eight presents the categories of short term borrowings

during  the corporation issued million of trust preferred securities and billion in long term senior and subordinated debt 
see notes eight and nine of the consolidated financial statements on pages and for further details on long term debt and trust preferred securities 
other the corporation has commercial paper back up lines totaling billion of which million expires in october and million expires in october in addition  the corporation has a billion line of credit which expires in may no borrowings have been made under these lines

see note twelve of the consolidated financial statements on page for further details on dividend capabilities of its subsidiary banks 
capital resources and capital management shareholders equity on december  was billion compared to billion on december  the increase was primarily due to net earnings net income less dividends of billion coupled with the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock under various employee plans 
the increase was partially offset by the repurchase of million shares of common stock for approximately billion and a net decrease of million in the market value of securities available for sale and marketable equity securities 
the corporation s and its significant banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios  along with a description of the components of risk based capital  capital adequacy requirements and prompt corrective action provisions  are included in note twelve of the consolidated financial statements on page off balance sheet derivatives asset and liability management alm activities interest rate contracts are used in the asset and liability management process 
these contracts  which are generally non leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps  options and futures  allow the corporation to effectively manage its interest rate risk position 
generic interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments based on the contractual underlying notional amount 
basis swaps involve the exchange of interest payments based on the contractual underlying notional amounts  where both the pay rate and the receive rate are floating rates based on different indices 
option products primarily consist of caps and floors 
interest rate caps and floors are agreements where  for a fee  the purchaser obtains the right to receive interest payments when a variable interest rate moves above or below a specified cap or floor rate  respectively 
futures contracts used for alm activities are primarily index futures providing for cash payments based upon the movements of a deposit rate index 
the amount of net realized deferred gains associated with terminated alm swaps were million and million on december  and december   respectively 
the amount of net realized deferred losses associated with terminated alm futures and forward rate contracts was million on december   compared to a gain of million on december  the amount of net realized deferred gains associated with terminated alm options were million and million on december  and december   respectively 
see note eleven of the consolidated financial statements on page for information on the notional amounts and fair values of the corporation s alm interest rate contracts 
in addition  the corporation uses foreign currency contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denominated assets and liabilities  as well as the corporation s equity investments in foreign subsidiaries 
foreign exchange contracts  which include spot  forward and futures contracts  represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed upon price  on an agreed upon settlement date 
on december   these contracts had a notional value of billion and a fair value of million 
the fair values of the alm interest rate and foreign exchange portfolios should be viewed in the context of the overall balance sheet 
the value of any single component of the balance sheet or off balance sheet positions should not be viewed in isolation 
for a discussion of the corporation s management of risk associated with mortgage production and servicing activities  see the noninterest income section on page market risk management in the normal course of conducting its business activities  the corporation is exposed to market risks which include both price and liquidity risk 
market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange risk  commodity prices commodity risk and prices of equity securities equity risk 
financial products that expose the corporation to market risk include securities  loans  deposits  debt  and derivative financial instruments such as futures  forwards  swaps  options  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the corporation may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or that the corporation may be more reliant on alternative funding sources such as long term debt 
market risk is managed by the corporation s finance committee  which formulates policy based on desirable levels of market risk 
in setting desirable levels of market risk  the finance committee considers the impact on both earnings and capital of the current outlook in market rates  potential changes in market rates  world and regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
for a discussion of non trading  on balance sheet financial instruments see table nine in the following market risk management section on page for information on market risk associated with alm activities  see the following discussion on page of the market risk management section and the mortgage banking section of noninterest income on page market risk associated with the trading portfolio is discussed in the following market risk management section on page the composition of the trading portfolio and related fair values are included in note four of the consolidated financial statements on page prior to the bankamerica merger  market risk exposure was managed by each of the previously separate companies 
separate risk management models and assumptions were used in accordance with each company s unique market risk profile 
the market risk information presented in this section is as of  or for the year ended  december  and reflects the market risk profile of the merged company 
prior period amounts have not been presented as such amounts were based on the risk profiles of the previously separate entities and  accordingly  are not comparable to current period amounts 
non trading portfolio the corporation s alm process is used to manage interest rate risk through the structuring of balance sheet and off balance sheet portfolios and identifying and linking such off balance sheet positions to specific assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk represents the only material market risk exposure to the corporation s non trading on balance sheet financial instruments 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses sophisticated computer simulations which determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  securities  loans  deposits  borrowings and off balance sheet financial instruments 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these scenarios  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis by senior management 
additionally  duration and market value sensitivity measures are selectively utilized where they provide added value to the overall interest rate risk management process 
on december   the interest rate risk position of the corporation was relatively neutral as the impact of a gradual parallel basis point rise or fall in interest rates over the next months was estimated to be less than one percent of net interest income 
table nine below summarizes the expected maturities  unrealized gains and losses and weighted average effective yields and rates associated with the corporation s significant non trading on balance sheet financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  time deposits placed and other short term investments  federal funds sold and purchased  resale and repurchase agreements  commercial paper  other short term borrowings and foreign deposits  which are similar in nature to other short term borrowings  are excluded from table nine as their respective carrying values approximate fair values 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to insignificant market risk as they have either no stated maturities or an average maturity of less than days and interest rates that approximate market rates 
however  these financial instruments could expose the corporation to interest rate risk by requiring more or less reliance on alternative funding sources  such as long term debt 
loans held for sale are also excluded as their carrying values approximate their fair values  generally exposing the corporation to insignificant market risk 
for further information on the fair value of financial instruments see notes four and fifteen of the consolidated financial statements on pages and  respectively

when measuring and managing market risk associated with domestic deposits  the corporation considers its long term relationships with depositors 
the unrealized loss on deposits in this table does not consider these long term relationships  therefore only certificates of deposits reflect a change in value 
excludes foreign time deposits 
expected maturities of long term debt and trust preferred securities reflect the corporation s ability to redeem such debt prior to contractual maturities 
risk management interest rate contracts are utilized in the alm process 
such contracts  which are generally non leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps  futures  forwards  and options  allow the corporation to effectively manage its interest rate risk position 
as reflected in table ten  the notional amount of the corporation s receive fixed and pay fixed interest rate swaps on december  was billion  primarily converting variable rate commercial loans to fixed rate  and billion  respectively 
the net receive fixed position on december  was billion compared to billion on december  in addition  the corporation had billion of basis swaps linked primarily to loans and long term debt 
table ten also summarizes the expected maturities  weighted average pay and receive rates and the unrealized gains and losses on december  of the corporation s alm interest rate swaps  as well as the expected maturities and unrealized gains and losses on december  of the corporation s alm basis swaps  forwards  futures  and options contracts 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the last repricing and will change in the future primarily based on movements in one  three and six month libor rates 
the net unrealized gain on the alm swap portfolio on december  was million compared to a net unrealized loss of million on december   primarily reflecting a decrease in interest rates 
the net unrealized gain in the estimated value of the alm interest rate contracts should be viewed in the context of the overall balance sheet 
the value of any single component of the balance sheet or off balance sheet positions should not be viewed in isolation

the trading risk committee trc establishes and monitors various limits on trading activities 
these limits include product volume  gross and net positions  and value at risk var and profit and loss simulation limits 
product volume limits establish maximum aggregate amounts of specific types of derivatives  foreign exchange contracts  and securities that the corporation may hold in its trading account at any point in time 
position limits restrict the gross and net amount of contracts that can be held in the trading account in any specific maturity grouping 
var measures the potential loss in future earnings due to market rate movements within the trading portfolio using proprietary models that are based on statistical probability 
var limits establish the maximum amount of potential loss  based upon sophisticated modeling techniques  that the corporation is willing to assume at any point in time 
additionally  the corporation uses profit and loss simulations to measure the potential for loss in various segments of the trading portfolio resulting from specific and extremely adverse scenarios 
these scenarios are projected without regard to the statistical probability of their occurrences 
loss simulation limits establish the maximum amount of projected loss computed by the simulation that the corporation is willing to assume 
the corporation reduces the market risk to which it is exposed in the trading account by executing offsetting transactions with other counterparties 
however  the corporation may also retain  generally on a temporary basis  open or uncovered trading account positions in an effort to generate revenue by correctly anticipating future market conditions and customer demands or by taking advantage of price differentials among the various markets in which it operates 
the day to day management of interest rate and foreign exchange risks takes place at a decentralized level within the corporation s various trading centers 
limits established by the trc are assigned to each trading center 
in addition  documented trading policies and procedures define acceptable boundaries within which traders can execute transactions in their assigned markets 
the corporation uses a var methodology to measure the interest rate  foreign exchange  commodity and equity risks inherent in its trading activities 
under this methodology  management models historical data to statistically calculate  with percent confidence  the potential loss in earnings the corporation might experience if an adverse one day shift in market prices was to occur 
the corporation performs the var calculation for each major trading portfolio segment on a daily basis 
it then calculates the combined var across these portfolio segments using two different sets of assumptions 
the first calculation assumes that each portfolio segment experiences adverse price movements at the same time ie  the price movements are perfectly correlated 
the second calculation assumes that these adverse price movements within the major portfolio segments do not occur at the same time ie  they are uncorrelated 
trading activities market risk us dollar equivalents in millions year ended december  average var high var low var based on perfect positive correlation interest rate foreign currency commodities equity based on zero correlation interest rate foreign currency commodities equity the high and low for the entire trading account may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the components occurred on different trading days 
the table above sets forth the calculated var amounts for the year ended the amounts are calculated on a pre tax basis 
although the corporation s trading positions have remained generally consistent during  var levels have been impacted by recent volatility in market conditions 
var modeling on trading is subject to numerous limitations 
in addition  the corporation recognizes that there are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with modeling and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates 
the corporation mitigates these uncertainties through close monitoring and by examining and updating assumptions on an ongoing basis 
the continual trading risk management process considers the impact of unanticipated risk exposure and updates assumptions to reduce loss exposure 
credit risk management and credit portfolio review in conducting business activities  the corporation is exposed to the risk that borrowers or counterparties may default on their obligations to the corporation 
credit risk arises through the extension of loans and leases  certain securities  letters of credit  financial guarantees and through counterparty exposure on trading and capital markets transactions 
to manage this risk  the credit risk management group establishes policies and procedures to manage both on and off balance sheet credit risk and communicates and monitors the application of these policies and procedures throughout the corporation 
the corporation s overall objective in managing credit risk is to minimize the adverse impact of any single event or set of events 
to achieve this objective  the corporation strives to maintain a credit risk profile that is diverse in terms of product type  industry concentration  geographic distribution and borrower or counterparty concentration 
the credit risk management group works with lending officers  trading personnel and various other line personnel in areas that conduct activities involving credit risk and is involved in the implementation  refinement and monitoring of credit policies and procedures 
the corporation manages credit exposure to individual borrowers and counterparties on an aggregate basis including loans and leases  securities  letters of credit  bankers acceptances  derivatives and unfunded commitments 
the creditworthiness of a borrower or counterparty is determined by experienced personnel  and limits are established for the total credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty 
credit limits are subject to varying levels of approval by senior line and credit risk management 
for commercial lending  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers or counterparties an initial risk rating which is based primarily on the amount of inherent credit risk and reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit risk personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit risk management personnel for deterioration in a borrower s or counterparty s financial condition which would impact the ability of the borrower or counterparty to perform under the contract 
risk ratings are adjusted as necessary 
for consumer lending  credit scoring systems are utilized to provide standards for extension of credit 
consumer portfolio credit risk is monitored primarily using statistical models and actual payment experience to predict portfolio behavior 
when required  the corporation obtains collateral to support credit extensions and commitments 
generally  such collateral is in the form of real and personal property  cash on deposit or other highly liquid instruments 
in certain circumstances  the corporation obtains real property as security for some loans that are made on the general creditworthiness of the borrower and whose proceeds were not used for real estate related purposes 
the corporation also manages exposure to a single borrower  industry  product type or other concentration through syndications of credits  participations  loan sales and securitizations 
through global corporate and investment banking  the corporation is a major participant in the syndications market 
in a syndicated facility  each participating lender funds only its portion of the syndicated facility  therefore limiting its exposure to the borrower 
the corporation also identifies and reduces its exposure to the funded borrower  product or industry concentrations through loan sales 
generally  these sales are without recourse to the corporation 
in conducting derivatives activities in certain jurisdictions  the corporation reduces credit risk to any one counterparty through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements which allow the corporation to settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty on a net basis 
for more information on the corporation s off balance sheet credit risk  see note eleven of the consolidated financial statements on page an independent credit review group conducts ongoing reviews of credit activities and portfolios  reexamining on a regular basis risk assessments for credit exposures and overall compliance with policy 
loans and leases portfolio the corporation s credit exposure is focused in its loans and leases portfolio  which totaled billion on december  table fifteen presents a distribution of loans and leases by category 
allowance for credit losses the corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan and lease portfolios to identify risks inherent in and to assess the overall collectibility of those portfolios 
these detailed reviews  combined with historical loss experience  result in the identification and quantification of loss factors which are used in determining the amount of the allowance and related provision for credit losses 
consumer loans and leases  which includes residential mortgages  home equity lines  direct indirect  consumer finance and foreign consumer loans  are generally evaluated as a group  based on loan type 
remaining loans and leases are evaluated individually due to a general lack of uniformity among individual loans within each loan type and assigned a risk rating 
the loss factors are applied to each individual loan based on the particular item s risk ratings or to specific loan groups in order to provide a basis for establishing an adequate level of allowance for credit losses 
portions of the allowance for credit losses  as presented on table twelve  are allocated to cover the estimated losses inherent in each loan and lease category based on the results of the corporation s detail review process 
further allocations are made based on specific existing economic conditions as well as performance trends within specific portfolio segments and individual concentrations of credit 
the remaining unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on general economic  performance and credit concentration trends  including geographic concentrations 
the nature of the process by which the corporation determines the appropriate allowance for credit losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
after review of all relevant matters effecting loan collectibility  management believes that the allowance for credit losses  see note twelve of the consolidated financial statements on page  is appropriate given its analysis of inherent credit losses on december  the corporation s allowance for credit losses was billion  or percent of loans and leases on december   compared to billion  or percent  on december   with the increase attributable to the establishment of a million reserve in the third quarter of  related to deterioration in certain international economic conditions that arose in the third quarter of table eleven provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for credit losses
