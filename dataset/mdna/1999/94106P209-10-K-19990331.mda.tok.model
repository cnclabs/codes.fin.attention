introduction the company is an integrated non hazardous solid waste management company that provides solid waste collection  recycling  transfer and disposal services to commercial  industrial  residential and municipal customers within certain regional markets in the northeast and mid atlantic states  where it operates 
the company focuses on the operation of an integrated non hazardous solid waste management business  including the ownership and operation of solid waste disposal facilities landfills  transfer stations and solid waste collection services 
the company derives revenue from collecting solid waste from its customers  which it delivers for disposal in its own landfills  and also from unaffiliated waste collection companies who pay to dispose of waste in the company s landfills 
the company seeks through its acquisition strategy to acquire substantial collection operations and transfer stations in association with its landfills in order to enhance its overall profitability and to increase its control over its sources of revenue 
see business strategy during  the company acquired a total of companies including two landfills  collection companies of which included a transfer station and one transfer station 
due to the significance of the acquired business operations to the company s financial performance  the company does not believe that its historical financial statements are necessarily indicative of future performance and as a result will affect the comparability of the financial information included herein 
revenues revenues represent fees charged to customers for solid waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services provided 
arrangements with customers include both long term contractual arrangements and as received disposal at prices quoted by the company 
revenues for the periods presented in the consolidated statements of operations were derived from the following sources year ended december  collection landfill transfer total revenue for the purpose of this table  revenue is attributed fully to the operation where the company first receives the waste 
for example  revenue received from waste collected by the company and disposed in a company landfill is entirely attributed to collection 
the increase in the company s collection revenues as a percentage of total revenues during compared to is due primarily to the impact of the collection companies acquired during the decrease in landfill and transfer station revenue as a percentage of revenues in compared to is due primarily to the acquisition of collection companies that had been disposing of their waste at the company s transfer stations and landfills 
these acquired revenues are now being recorded as collection revenue

these acquisitions have combined annual revenue of approximately million 
the acquisitions have all been recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain data derived from the company s consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues operating expenses depreciation and amortization acquisition integration costs write off of project development costs total cost of operations gross profit loss selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring amortization of prepaid consulting fees loss from operations royalty and other income expense  net interest income interest expense and financing costs equity in loss of affiliate write off of assets write off of accounts receivable total other income expense income tax expense loss from continuing operations discontinued operations loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item net loss ebitda adjusted ebitda year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for increased by  or to  from  in thirty four acquisitions completed by the company in accounted for approximately million or of the increase 
the balance of the increase is the result of the internal growth within the vermont operations during the growth in the vermont operations was due to the full year s operation of the cswd transfer station  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of  increased volume and prices at the moretown landfill and internal growth at the company s collection operations 
cost of operations 
operating expenses for was approximately  compared to  for the increase of  was primarily due to the acquisitions completed by the company in and the related increase in revenue 
as a percentage of sales  operating expenses increased to approximately in from approximately in this increase was primarily due to the change in revenue mix  with a much larger portion of the revenue coming from collection operations  which typically experience much higher operating expenses than landfill operations 
the company internalizes a significant portion of its waste collected in vermont and pennsylvania  which significantly reduces costs of operations as a percentage of revenue 
the company s new york and massachusetts operations do not yet have landfills where waste can be internalized 
operating costs  disposal costs  and collection fees vary widely throughout the geographic areas in which the company operates 
the prices that the company charges are determined locally  and typically vary by the volume or weight  type of waste collected  frequency of collections  distance to final disposal sites  labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
the increase of  was primarily due to the additional depreciation and amortization related to the company s acquisitions completed during during  the company purchased property and equipment of approximately  related to the acquisitions 
 of this amount was for assets under development not placed into service in goodwill and other intangible assets totaling approximately  were also recorded in connection with the acquisitions 
in addition  the company purchased approximately  of property and equipment necessary for its ongoing operations  including costs to improve efficiencies at several of the acquired companies 
finally  landfill amortization costs in vermont increased due to increased usage of the moretown landfill in the company had costs of approximately  for construction of cell at the moretown landfill and other development costs related to the mostoller and south hadley landfill and the transfer station in oxford massachusetts totaling approximately  these costs did not impact operating results as they were not placed into service in acquisition integration costs 
acquisition integration costs consist of one time  non recurring costs  which in the opinion of management have no future value and  therefore  are expensed 
such costs include termination and retention of employees  lease termination costs  costs related to the integration of information systems and costs related to the change of name of the acquired company or business 
these charges are estimated and accrued at the time the acquisition is closed 
the estimates are reviewed frequently by company management and the related operation teams integrating the new acquisitions and adjusted as required 
acquisition integration costs totaled  for write off of landfill development costs 
write off of landfill development costs were  and  for and  respectively 
the write off of landfill development costs is related to the termination of the company s contract for remodeling and operation of a landfill in fairhaven  massachusetts 
see footnote fairhaven massachusetts operation in the financial statements included in item the expense of  represents the final charges related to the termination of the project 
there are no remaining accruals at december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  in to  from  in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the dollar increase was due to efforts by the company to build infrastructure to sustain its significant growth through acquisition and to support the several corporate initiatives designed to implement its strategy 
the company expects spending growth to continue moderately into as the company continues to implement its growth through acquisition strategy 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the expanded revenue base and related efficiencies  as the company is able to purchase tuck in acquisitions that increase revenues and improve margins without adding significant administrative costs 
the company anticipates that in future periods its selling  general and administrative expenses should continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue as it leverages its current corporate overhead to revenue growth primarily through acquisitions 
restructuring 
during  the company announced its intention to restructure the company s operations to focus its resources and activities on developing an integrated solid waste management operation 
see footnote restructuring and discontinued operations in the financial statements included in item the restructuring was completed in restructuring charges for totaled  which consisted of costs incurred for employee severance  non cancelable lease commitments  professional fees and litigation costs 
no charges were recorded in royalty and other income expense 
royalty and other income expense was approximately  and  in and  respectively 
royalty and other income expense primarily relates to the company s medical waste treatment proprietary technologies 
interest expense and financing costs  net 
interest expense for was approximately  net of interest income of  as compared to approximately  net of interest income of  for the increase resulted primarily from significant increases in debt necessary to finance the acquisitions and capital needs of the company 
during and  the company capitalized interest expense of  and  respectively related to construction costs for the mostoller and south hadley landfills and the transfer station in oxford massachusetts discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for increased by  to  from  in the increase of was due primarily to the increased waste volume accepted at the moretown landfill  in its first full year of operation  the acquisition through a lease purchase arrangement on october  of the chittenden solid waste district cswd transfer station located in williston  vermont and the internal growth of the company s collection operations 
all revenues were generated from the company s vermont operations as compared to  where approximately  or was generated from the company s operations at the fairhaven landfill 
cost of operations 
operating expenses for was approximately  compared to  in the increase of  was primarily due to the growth of the company s vermont operations

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
the increase of  or was due primarily to the growth in the operation at the moretown landfill which resulted in increased amortization of capitalized landfill costs and to a substantial increase in capital equipment used in the company s other vermont operations

the write off of landfill development costs is related to the fairhaven landfill 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were approximately  a decrease of from the decrease was due to the restructuring undertaken in march of and to the cessation of operations at the fairhaven landfill 
the decrease was partially offset by increases in selling  general and administrative expenses at the company s vermont operations and general corporate expenses due to the building of an infrastructure necessary to support increases in acquisition  operating and administrative activities 
restructuring 
prior to march   the company had been actively developing environmental technologies with potential application in a number of business areas 
on march   the company announced its intention to take meaningful actions to conserve cash and working capital  including restructuring the company s operations to focus its resources and activities on developing an integrated solid waste management operation 
as part of the restructuring  the company ceased operations at its technology center in woburn  massachusetts  and discharged all employees and consultants previously engaged in developing technologies with potential application in certain environmental related activities  including the manufacture of useful materials from tires and other recycled materials  contaminated soil cleanup and recycling  industrial sludge disposal  size reduction equipment design and manufacture the ancillary technologies  and major sports fantasies  inc msf  a business unrelated to the environmental industry 
no substantial revenues were received from the technology center operations or msf activities 
restructuring charges for and were  and  respectively  which consisted of costs incurred for employee severance  non cancelable lease commitments  professional fees and litigation costs 
royalty and other income expense 
royalty and other income expense decreased approximately  in to  from  in the decrease in was due to the termination of one of the company s licensing agreements with scotsafe limited scotsafe 
interest expense and financing costs 
interest expense for was approximately  net of interest income of  as compared to approximately  net of interest income of  for the increase resulted primarily from additional indebtedness incurred in connection with acquisitions and capital expenditures for the company s vermont operations 
during and  the company capitalized interest expense of  and  respectively related to construction costs 
write off of accounts receivable 
during the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off an uncollectible receivable due from scotsafe of approximately liquidity and capital resources the company s business is capital intensive 
the company s capital requirements  which are substantial  include acquisitions  property and equipment purchases and capital expenditures for landfill cell construction  landfill development and landfill closure activities 
principally due to these factors  the company may incur working capital deficits 
the company plans to meet its capital needs through various financing sources  including internally generated funds  equity securities and debt 
on may   the company closed on an offering of million convertible subordinated notes which resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
as discussed in recent business developments  on march   the company completed a private offering of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million due january  which resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the company has used the proceeds from these debt offerings to complete various acquisitions during and in addition  the company has repaid other outstanding debt obligations  repurchased  shares of the company s common stock from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  and fund the company s growth  including infrastructure 
the company intends to use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including possible future acquisitions and working capital 
in addition  approximately  of the convertible subordinated notes were exchanged into common stock during march through an exchange offering 
the company intends to continue its strategy to aggressively pursue and develop an integrated solid waste management company  primarily through acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available  or available on terms acceptable to the company 
any failure of the company to obtain required financing would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company maintains an acquisitions department that is responsible for the identification  due diligence  negotiation and closure of acquisitions 
the company believes that a combination of internally generated funds  additional debt and equity financing and the proceeds from the notes will provide adequate funds to support the company s cost structure  acquisition strategy and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in connection with its growth strategy  the company currently is and at any given time will be involved in potential acquisitions that are in various stages of exploration and negotiation ranging from initial discussions to the execution of letters of intent and the preparation of definitive agreements  some of which may  if consummated  be material 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will be successful in completing further acquisitions in accordance with its growth strategy  or that such acquisitions  if completed  will be successful 
during  the company acquired a total of companies  including eleven collection companies one of which included a transfer station in vermont  five collection companies and two landfills in central pennsylvania  three collection companies and a transfer station in central massachusetts and twelve collection companies one of which included a transfer station in central upstate new york 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was approximately million consisting of approximately million in cash  million in common stock and approximately million in assumed liabilities 
acquisition integration costs for the year ended december   related to the acquisitions in vermont  central pennsylvania  central massachusetts and central upstate new york  were approximately  the company generated net cash from operating activities for approximately  in  the company used approximately  for operating activities 
the improved cash flow from operations in was due primarily to the increased revenues which were offset by related increases in cost of operations  integration costs and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the remainder of the cash flow increase was due to changes in the operating assets and liabilities including increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
these were offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
ebitda increased by approximately  during to approximately  from negative ebitda of approximately  in as a percentage of revenue  ebitda increased to during from in adjusted ebitda increased by approximately  during to approximately  from negative adjusted ebitda of approximately  in as a percentage of revenue  adjusted ebitda increased to in compared to in net cash used by investing activities during was approximately  compared to cash generated of approximately  in of the net cash used by investing activities in  approximately  million was used for the acquisition of landfill  collection and transfer operations in vermont  central pennsylvania  central massachusetts and central upstate new york 
in addition  the company placed deposits for future acquisitions totaling  additional capital expenditures of approximately  were made to develop cell at the company s moretown landfill and to increase operating efficiencies at the company s vermont  central pennsylvania  central massachusetts and central upstate new york operations 
other investing activity included the acquisition of various long term permits necessary to operate the landfills and for long term prepaid disposal costs 
the net cash generated by investing activities for was primarily due to the reduction in collateral requirements on the vermont landfill closure and post closure performance bond of approximately  and the proceeds from the sale of the fairhaven equipment for approximately  these were offset by capital expenditures at the company s vermont operation 
the company s capital expenditures and capital needs for acquisitions have increased significantly  reflecting the company s rapid growth by acquisition and development of revenue producing assets  and will increase further as the company continues to complete acquisitions 
total capital expenditures are expected to further increase during due to acquisitions  ongoing construction of cell at the moretown landfill  the development and construction of the mostoller and south hadley landfills and construction of the transfer station in central massachusetts 
net cash provided by financing activities during was approximately  compared to  in the increase in was due primarily to the receipt of the net proceeds of million related to the convertible subordinated notes  borrowings under the company s bank credit facility of million  million in additional short term financing from a related party stockholder and borrowings for equipment purchases of approximately million 
the proceeds were offset by principal repayments of debt of approximately million and dividend payments on the preferred stock of approximately  the company has a million line of credit facility with the howard bank  na which was fully drawn as of december the entire balance was repaid on march  with the proceeds from the senior notes 
the company is currently negotiating an expansion of this facility with the howard bank 
at december   the company had approximately million of short term and long term debt 
based upon its current operating plan  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  available borrowings  future cash flow from operations and the proceeds of future debt and equity financings will satisfy the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurances in this regard 
see certain factors affecting future operating results substantial increased leverage  and uncertain ability to finance the company s growth 
certain factors affecting future operating results history of losses during the fiscal years ending december   and  the company suffered net losses including non recurring charges of approximately   and  respectively  on revenues of   and  respectively 
following its restructuring in in which the company directed its focus on becoming an integrated solid waste management company  the company implemented a business strategy based on aggressive growth through acquisitions 
the company s ability to become profitable  and to maintain such profitability  as it pursues its business strategy will depend upon several factors  including its ability to i execute its acquisition strategy and expand its revenue generating operations while not proportionately increasing its administrative overhead  ii locate sufficient additional financing to fund acquisitions  and iii continually adapt to changing conditions in the competitive market in which it operates 
outside factors  such as the economic and regulatory environments in which it operates will also have an effect on the company s business 
substantial increased leverage in connection with its business strategy  the company has incurred and expects to incur substantial indebtedness  resulting in a highly leveraged capital structure 
the company s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences  including limiting the company s ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 
this may increase the company s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  requiring the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on the company s indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of the company s cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limiting the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the company s business and the industry in which the company operates  placing the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to the company s competitors that have less indebtedness and limiting the company s ability to borrow additional funds 
uncertain ability to finance the company s growth the company will require substantial funds to complete and bring to commercial viability all of its currently planned projects 
the company also anticipates that future business acquisitions will be financed through cash from operations  the proceeds from the senior notes  borrowings under its bank credit facility  offering the company s stock as consideration for acquisitions or additional equity or debt financings 
therefore  the company s ability to satisfy its future capital and operating requirements is dependent on a number of pending or future financing activities  none of which is assured successful completion 
ability to identify  acquire and integrate acquisition targets the future success of the company is highly dependent upon the company s continued ability to successfully identify  acquire and integrate additional solid waste collection  recycling  transfer and disposal businesses 
as competition for acquisition candidates increases within the solid waste management industry  the availability of suitable candidates at terms favorable to the company may decrease 
the company competes for acquisition candidates with larger  more established companies that may have significantly greater capital resources than the company  which can further decrease the availability of suitable acquisition candidates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  obtain necessary financings on favorable terms or successfully integrate any acquisitions with current operations 
the company believes that a significant factor in its ability to consummate acquisitions will be the attractiveness of the company s common stock as consideration for potential acquisition targets 
this attractiveness may  in large part  be dependent upon the relative market price and capital prospects of the company s equity securities as compared to the equity securities of its competitors 
if the market price of the company s common stock were to decline  the company s ability to implement its acquisition program through the issuance of its common stock could be materially adversely affected 
ability to manage growth the company s objective is to continue to grow by expanding its services in markets where it can be one of the largest and most profitable fully integrated solid waste management companies 
accordingly  the company may experience periods of significant rapid growth 
such growth  if it were to occur  could place a significant strain on the company s management and its operational  financial and other resources 
any failure to expand its operational and financial systems and controls or to recruit appropriate personnel in an efficient manner at a pace consistent with such growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future success is also highly dependent upon its continuing ability to identify  hire  train and motivate highly qualified personnel 
the company faces competition for hiring such personnel from other companies  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel as required for its projected operations 
the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limitations on landfill permitting and expansion the company s operations depend on its ability to expand the landfills it owns or operates and develop or acquire new landfill sites 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining new landfill sites or expanding the permitted capacity of its existing landfills 
the process of obtaining required permits and approvals to operate and expand landfills and transfer stations has become increasingly difficult and expensive 
the process can take several years and involves hearings and compliance with zoning  environmental and other requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining and maintaining required permits 
even when granted  final permits to expand are often not approved until the remaining capacity of a landfill is very low 
in the event the company exhausts its permitted capacity at one of its landfills  the company s ability to expand internally will be limited and the company will be required to cap and close such landfill 
in addition  the company could be forced to dispose of its waste at landfills operated by its competitors 
the additional costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
dependence on management the company s future success is highly dependent upon the services of its executive officers  particularly philip strauss  chairman  chief executive officer and president of the company  and robert rivkin  executive vice president acquisitions  chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary of the company 
the company has obtained key executive insurance policies in the amount of million with respect to each of messrs 
strauss and rivkin 
the loss of the services of mr 
strauss or mr 
rivkin could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the solid waste management industry is highly competitive  very fragmented and requires substantial labor and capital resources 
competition exists for collection  recycling  transfer and disposal services  and acquisition targets 
the markets the company competes or is likely to compete in are usually served by one or more of the large national  regional or local solid waste companies who may have accumulated substantial goodwill and or have greater financial  marketing or technical resources than those available to the company 
the company also competes with counties  municipalities and operators of alternative disposal facilities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities 
the availability of user fees  charges or tax revenues and the availability of tax exempt financing may provide a competitive advantage to the public sector 
additionally  alternative disposal facilities such as recycling and incineration may reduce the demand for the disposal of solid waste in landfills 
competition for waste collection and disposal business is based on price  the quality of service and geographical location 
from time to time  competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand or maintain market share or to win competitively bid contracts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully bid such contracts or compete with the larger and better capitalized companies 
geographic concentration of operations the company has established solid waste management operations in vermont  central pennsylvania  central massachusetts and central upstate new york 
since the company s current primary source of revenues will be concentrated in these geographic locations  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by  without limitation  the following i downturns in these local economies  ii severely harsh weather conditions and iii state regulations 
additionally  the growing competition within the local economies for waste streams may make it increasingly difficult to expand within these regions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase the waste stream to its landfills or be able to expand its geographic markets to mitigate the effects of adverse events that may occur in these regions 
seasonally the company s revenues and results of operations tend to vary seasonally 
the winter months of the fourth and first quarters of the calendar year tend to yield lower revenues than those experienced in the warmer months of the second and third quarters 
the primary reasons for lower revenues in the winter months include  without limitation i harsh winter weather conditions which can interfere with collection and transportation  ii the construction and demolition activities which generate landfill waste are primarily performed in the warmer seasons and iii the volume of waste in the region is generally lower than that which occurs in warmer months 
the company believes that the seasonally of the revenue stream will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations on an annualized basis 
environmental and government regulations the company and its customers operate in a highly regulated environment  and in general the company s landfill projects will be required to have federal  state and or local government permits and approvals 
any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial  revocation or modification under various circumstances 
in addition  if new environmental legislation or regulations are adopted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently  the company or its customers may be required to obtain additional operating permits or approvals 
there can be no assurance that the company will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements 
any delay in obtaining required permits or approvals will tend to cause delays in the company s ability to obtain project financing  resulting in increases in the company s need to invest working capital in projects prior to obtaining more permanent financing  and will also tend to reduce project returns by deferring the receipt of project revenues 
in the event that the company is required to cancel any planned project as a result of the inability to obtain required permits or other regulatory impediments  the company may lose any investment it has made in the project up to that point  and the cancellation of any landfill projects may have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
potential environmental liability and adverse effect of environmental regulation the company s business exposes it to the risk that it will be held liable if harmful substances escape into the environment and cause damages or injuries as a result of its operating activities 
moreover  federal  state and local environmental legislation and regulations require substantial expenditures and impose significant liabilities for non compliance 
the company believes that it is currently in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws 
potential adverse community relations the potential exists for unexpected delays  costs and litigation resulting from community resistance and concerns relating to existing and acquired operations and proposed future development of solid waste facilities 
performance or surety bonds and letters of credit the company may be required to post a performance bond  surety bond or letter of credit to ensure proper closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance at its landfills and transfer stations 
failure to obtain performance bonds  surety bonds or letters of credit in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental impairment liability insurance the company has obtained environmental impairment liability insurance covering claims for the sudden or gradual onset of environmental damage to the extent of million per landfill 
if the company were to incur liability for environmental damage in excess of its insurance limits  its financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company also carries a comprehensive general liability insurance policy  which management considers adequate at this time to protect its assets and operations from other risks 
adequacy of accruals for closure and post closure costs the company has material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of its existing landfills and any landfill it may purchase or operate in the future 
the company estimates and accrues closure and post closure costs based on engineering estimates of landfill usage and remaining landfill capacity 
there can be no assurance that the company s financial obligations for closure and post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued  which  if it occurs  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
capital expenditures the company capitalizes  in accordance with gaap  certain expenditures and advances relating to acquisitions  pending acquisitions and landfill projects 
the company s policy is to expense in the current period all unamortized capital expenditures and advances relating to any operation that is permanently shut down or any acquisition that will not be consummated and any landfill project that is terminated 
thus  the company may be required to incur a charge against earnings in future periods that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance the statements in the following section include the year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
please refer to the information located at the beginning of this item regarding forward looking statements contained in this section 
the company is assessing the readiness of its systems for handling the year although the assessment is still underway  management currently believes that all material systems will be compliant by year and that the costs associated with this are not material 
the company has incurred only minimal costs to date associated with the year issue 
the company is in the process of identifying key third party vendors to understand their ability to continue providing services through year the company uses well regarded nationally known software vendors for both its general accounting applications and industry specific customer information and billing systems 
the company is implementing a new general accounting package which will be fully year compatible  and the provider of the solid waste industry customer information and billing system is year compatible 
the company s banking arrangements are with national banking institutions  which are taking all necessary steps to insure its customers uninterrupted service throughout applicable year timeframes 
the company s payroll is performed out of house by the largest provider of third party payroll services in the country  which has made a commitment of uninterrupted service to their customers throughout applicable year timeframes 
while the company currently expects that the year issue will not cause significant operational problems  delays in the implementation of new information systems  or failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the company s systems and in the systems of suppliers and financial institutions could have material adverse consequences 
therefore  the company is developing contingency plans for continuous operations in the event such problems arise 
inflation the company does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation
