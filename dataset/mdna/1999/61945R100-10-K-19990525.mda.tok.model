results of operations vs 
for the year ended february  fy  the company incurred a net loss applicable to common shareholders of  or per share  basic and diluted 
during the prior fiscal year  the company reported net income applicable to common shareholders of  or 
per share basic and 
diluted 
revenues total revenues of  for fy were lower than total revenues from continuing operations reported for the fiscal year ended february  fy 
the decline was due to a  decrease in investment income loss and other income  which was partially offset on a increase in net sales from the jm ney company jm ney 
during fy  jm ney s sales increased by  such sales increase primarily reflected the pass through effect of increased selling prices for products containing palladium as a result of higher market prices for this particular precious metal 
during fy  the average market value for palladium was approximately per troy ounce  compared to approximately per troy ounce during fy during each of the last two years  the market for palladium has been both volatile and generally increasing 
during fy  the products sold by jm ney contained approximately  troy ounces of palladium 
overall sales growth was hampered by i the general motors labor strike  which reduced demand for many of jm ney s products that are sold to the automotive industry  ii the expiration of an exclusive manufacturing contract with the company s former dental segment which resulted in a sales decline of  and iii delays in the implementation of several sales programs to customers who had purchased the required tooling from jm ney but did not request the anticipated level of parts production 
activities which comprise investment income loss and other income produced a net loss of  during fy  versus income of  during fy as follows in thousands fy fy net loss gain from domestic investment portfolio  net loss gain from russian and eastern european portfolio  write down of long term russian investments  interest and dividends rental income ultrasonic royalty income gain from digital graphix other  net the domestic portfolio loss is comprised of net realized and unrealized losses of  from the company s portfolio of savings bank stocks   of losses from the sale of municipal bonds and a net gain of  from the sale of the company s investment in centennial cellular 
during fy  the market value for russian securities decreased significantly resulting in an unrealized decline of in the company s portfolio of russian  ukrainian and polish trading investments 
in addition  a jm ney investment in a russian bond fund declined in value by approximately  or of the original investment 
the company also wrote down the value of its long term investments in ias and vsmpo due to the russian market conditions  and the perceived impact on the company s ability to realize value from these investments in the near term 
during fy  increases in both the domestic and eastern european markets resulted in unrealized appreciation in the value of the company s investment portfolio 
cost of sales cost of sales totaled  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales in fy the decline in gross margins from to was the result of the previously noted higher palladium prices which were passed on in the form of higher selling prices without a commensurate margin markup 
during fy  sales of precious metal materials in the form of wire  strip and rod  represented of sales  as compared to for fy material products generally have lower average gross margins  due to the commodity nature of this product class  versus highly engineered parts and components  which involve more value added processing and higher gross billing margins 
this sales mix  and the resultant underabsorption of operating expenses contributed to lower average gross margins during fy compared to the prior year 
the fy margin decline was somewhat offset through expanded metals purchasing programs that included forward purchases of palladium and sales of put options for the purchase of palladium as a hedge against jm ney s manufacturing requirements 
in addition  jm ney reduced its inventory of palladium by approximately  troy ounces which resulted in a lifo gain of approximately  when measured against the beginning of the fiscal year palladium prices 
one further element contributing to offsetting narrower margins was a reclassification of approximately  in engineering costs to more properly reflect management s analysis of costs that related to the manufacture of its products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of  during fy represent a modest decline from the costs incurred in the prior fiscal year 
the company incurred costs in fy totaling  to convert jm ney s primary operating software to be yk compliant   of such costs incurred in fy lower legal fees and corporate level compensation expense contributed to the overall decline in these costs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales in fy the increase was attributable to effort expended to develop new alloys and expand jm ney s technical competencies in meeting the changing requirements of its target markets  and to approximately  of costs that were formerly allocated to product costs 
interest expense interest expense of  during fy was higher than the  of interest expense incurred during fy most of the increase relates to a full year of interest on a million subordinated note which jm ney issued during the fourth quarter of fy in addition  jm ney incurred increased interest expense on high interest rate palladium leases which served to hedge market risk  primarily attributable to its refining operations 
such interest costs were offset by charges to jm ney s refining customers that were included in other income 
income taxes an income tax benefit from continuing operations of  was recorded for fy which represents an effective tax rate of 
the  of net capital losses during fy was comprised of  of realized investment gains and  of net change in unrealized losses 
as a result   of the tax benefit is being deferred 
discontinued operations in february  the company reached a settlement agreement with the buyer of the net assets of its ultrasonics segment which it had sold as of february  under the terms of this settlement  the company received  of previously escrowed funds in addition to the million it had received at the closing 
in addition  the company also granted the buyer certain allowances against current year and future royalty payments 
as a result of the settlement and costs incurred leading to the agreement  the company recognized a net loss from the sale of this segment of  net of  of income tax benefits 
in the prior year  the company had recorded a gain of  on this sale  net of  of income taxes 
preferred dividends during fy  the company incurred  of preferred dividends based upon the revised terms of per share 
during fy  a total of  in dividends and discount accretion were accrued based on former terms under which the preferred dividends were linked to the operating results of jm ney 
vs 
revenues total revenues from continuing operations of  for the fiscal year ended february  fy were more than the  of revenues recorded for the year ended february  fy 
this increase represented a increase in sales generated by the jm ney company jm ney  and an increase of  of investment and other income over the net losses of  recorded in fy jm ney s increase in sales to  reflected growth in sales of contacts for sensors used in the automotive industry  and increased sales of precious metal materials  particularly materials for use in the manufacture of dental implant components 
such sales growth during fy is reflected net of a decline in sales to the company s former dental segment 
investment and other income totaled  for fy  compared to a loss of  in fy  as follows in thousands fy fy net gains from domestic investment portfolio   net gains from russian and eastern european portfolio interest and dividends rental income gain from digital graphix loss from investments in phoenix shannon  other  net gains from the company s domestic investment portfolio increased due to a rebound in the market value of the company s investment in centennial cellular  which had experienced a decline in value in fy  and to continued growth in value from the company s portfolio of financial institutions 
all gains from this portion of the investment portfolio in fy and fy represented increases in net unrealized appreciation of the underlying investments 
also  during fy  the company significantly expanded its investment activities in russia and eastern europe 
this resulted in the recording of net realized and unrealized gains of  net of valuation allowances of  established for the foreign trading portfolio  and  established for a russian security held for longer term investment 
such reserves were established to address volatility and liquidity concerns within these markets 
during fy  digital graphix  incorporated  an investment whose results had been consolidated with those of the company through april  sold its net assets and used the proceeds to repay notes  redeem its preferred stock  and issue liquidating dividends on its common stock 
as a result  the company received  in excess of the net carrying value of its investment 
during fy  the company wrote off  in the value of its investment in the common stock of  and a note receivable from  phoenix shannon  plc which had been received as part of the consideration for the sale of the net assets of the company s former dental segment in fy cost of sales cost of sales from continuing operations totaled  or of net sales in fy  compared to  or of net sales in fy the decline in the gross margins from to was caused primarily by significant increases and volatility in the price of palladium which is used in the majority of jm ney s products  and by increases in materials sales as a percentage of overall sales 
however  gross margins of  in fy represented a increase over fy levels 
during most of fy  the price of palladium remained relatively stable between per troy ounce and per troy ounce  with an increase at fiscal year end to above per ounce 
such a market condition enabled jm ney to replace the metal it had sold with metal of approximately equal value for lifo accounting purposes 
however  during fy  the price of palladium fluctuated widely 
prices ranged from a low of per troy ounce to a high of per ounce 
during much of this period  the market viewed these price increases as temporary  as reflected in the lower cost for palladium in future months 
accordingly  for certain segments of its business  this price increase could not be immediately passed on to jm ney s customers 
although jm ney had certain hedging programs in place  such strategies did not cover all sales programs involving significant quantities of palladium 
in addition  the company s fy gross margin benefited from lower gold prices  which served to slightly offset the impact of the effects of the palladium price increases and volatility 
also  during fy  sales of precious metal materials  in the form of wire  strip  and rod represented approximately of sales  compared to material sales of in fy material products generally have lower average gross margins  due to the commodity nature of the product  versus highly engineered parts and components  which involve more value added processing  and higher gross margins 
such sales mix contributed further to the lower average gross margins during fy selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations totaled  or more than the costs incurred during fy costs of approximately  incurred in the process of upgrading jm ney s manufacturing system to be year compliant  an increase of  of recruiting costs  including personnel fees and advertising  and legal costs incurred in connection with the exchange of the company s debentures and change of the terms of its preferred stock  all contributed to the growth in these expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from  or of sales in fy  to  or of sales in fy while increased material sales served to lower the relative comparison  the absolute increase of reflects the cost of efforts to develop new proprietary alloys that have similar physical attributes to existing alloys with lower palladium content to reduce exposure to market fluctuations  and to work on new manufacturing processes which enable jm ney to offer product alternatives 
interest expense interest expense increased from  in fy to  in fy increased borrowings under jm ney s revolving line of credit to support both its working capital requirements and those of ney ultrasonics served to increase interest expense 
in addition  significant increases in the leasing rates of palladium and platinum also served to increase financing costs under its line of credit 
jm ney was not exposed to these volatile interest rates to the extent that many other companies using palladium were  thus this impact was contained 
also  during the year  jm ney closed on a million seven year subordinated note that bears interest at the annual rate of 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs for two months added to the interest expense total 
income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations totaled  for fy  versus a tax benefit from continuing operations of  for fy the fy expense included a net increase of  in deferred income taxes payable 
the effective tax rate for fy was favorably impacted by the settlement of audits of prior state income tax returns 
discontinued operations effective february   the company sold the net assets of ney ultrasonics inc for a purchase price which was estimated to be approximately million  and additional contingent consideration 
net of expenses incurred in and accrued for the transaction  the company recognized a gain of  net of tax 
for the year then ended  ney ultrasonics inc generated approximately  of net income on sales of  during fy these operations generated an increase in sales of over fy  which produced the first operating profit in its history 
preferred dividends preferred dividends  including the amortization of issuance costs  totaled  during fy  which is a increase over the dividends of  accrued for fy the dividends per preferred share  which include a participating dividend based on the operating income of jm ney  increased from approximately per share in fy to approximately in fy however  due to purchases of shares of preferred stock during both years  the aggregate preferred dividends increased by a lower amount 
reversals of previously accrued but unpaid dividends added  and  to income applicable to common shareholders in fy and fy  respectively 
as a result of the shareholder approval of the change in the terms of the preferred stock  dividends that had been accrued from may through november were paid in february net income as a result of the income of  generated from continuing operations  income of  from discontinued operations  and the gain of  on the sale of ney ultrasonics inc  total net income for fy was  versus net income of  in fy after net preferred dividends  income applicable to common shareholders for fy was  or

diluted  versus income applicable to common shareholders of  or per basic and diluted share in fy liquidity and capital resources at february   consolidated cash and short term investments totaled  which is a decrease of  or  from february  within the current year total is a portfolio of common stocks of savings banks valued at  the company s trading portfolio of russian and eastern european securities with a reported value of  and jm ney s investment in a russian bond fund with a reported value of  under the terms of its million subordinated note agreement and revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank  jm ney is restricted from making payments to the company except as defined 
the defined payments are subject to jm ney s meeting certain financial covenants 
at february   jm ney s working capital was  or of consolidated net current assets  and its net worth  net of net liabilities to the company  including a million subordinated note payable  totaled  or of the company s consolidated total 
the company is dependent upon defined payments from jm ney  which in fy totaled  and on income from its investments to meet its operating expenses  debt service and preferred dividend obligations 
the company believes it can meet these requirements in the foreseeable future from these defined sources of cash flows  or from the proceeds of liquidations of existing investments 
during fy  the prices of the precious metals that jm ney utilizes in the alloying and manufacturing of its products experienced significant volatility 
primarily as a net result of an increase of approximately per ounce of the palladium content of its inventory  and a per ounce decline in the gold component of its inventory  jm ney s lifo reserve increased by  to maintain the net recorded value of these inventories at their historical values 
in june  sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be recognized immediately or deferred depending on the use of the derivative and if the derivative is a qualifying hedge 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
by january   as required 
the company is currently assessing the impact of this statement on the company s consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  words such as believes  anticipates  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the company cautions that a number of important factors could cause actual results for fiscal and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
such statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to i economic and political developments in russia and eastern europe  ii changes and volatility in the market for domestic equity securities  particularly in the financial services sector  iii changes in technology that would affect jm ney s products  or affect the value of the ultrasonic cleaning technology on which contingent consideration is based  iv acceptance of new product developments and v the price and volatility of precious metals 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to anticipate or respond timely to changes which could adversely affect its operating results in one or more fiscal quarters 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
year the year problems stem from three main issues two digit data storage  leap year calculations  and special meanings for dates ie  
there is not a simple solution to the year issue due to the fact that the use of dates for calculations is pervasive throughout software and the use of these calculations is not standardized 
state of readiness 
the company has formalized a comprehensive year plan that encompasses its products  vendors  customers  manufacturing equipment  technical infrastructure  facilities  telecommunications  and business systems 
the plan consists of the following phases inventory  assessment  remediation  testing  implementation  and a contingency plan for each area 
the plan also contains the cost associated with providing year solutions for each area 
the company s plan has been viewed favorably by a year consulting firm  which reviewed each element of the plan 
the company has completed the process of identifying and assessing the extent to which the year issue will affect its products  vendors  customers  manufacturing equipment  technical infrastructure  facilities  telecommunications and business systems 
to date  most of the financial and operational effort has been expended in implementing year compliant solutions or jm ney s enterprise resource planning erp systems and technical infrastructure 
this effort was completed in october the company is now in the process of remediation  testing and implementation of year compliant solutions for its manufacturing equipment  telecommunications  facilities and some minor business systems 
these processes are scheduled to be complete by september costs 
through february   approximately  has been expended on the year project  including  expended during fy additional year expenses to be incurred have been estimated to total less than  however  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur any unanticipated costs in completing its remediation for non compliant manufacturing equipment 
risks 
the company views its greatest area of exposure as being the degree of compliance of some of jm ney s manufacturing equipment 
there are machines that do not have blue prints  and information regarding the programmable logic controls is not always easy to obtain 
these same machines do not have a mechanism to change the date  nor do they display or print a date 
these same reasons could be a positive indicator to support the idea that they are not date sensitive machines 
jm ney will be performing extensive tests on all manufacturing equipment during the second fiscal quarter of fy other risks relate to the degree of readiness of the company s vendors  suppliers  customers  and other third parties 
any failure by these parties to ensure the year compliance could have an adverse effect on the company s position 
contingency 
the company will continue to develop its contingency strategies for every area 
special attention will be paid to the manufacturing and third party disciplines 
during the first quarter of fy  the company has been evaluating the responses from its single source and critical suppliers  and will be requesting updates from these suppliers as the year progresses 
additional or second sources will be identified for those suppliers who fail to provide sufficient year information or who are not compliant by september based upon a comprehensive review of exposure areas  the company believes that manufacturing and other operational and administrative activities will not be at significant risk due to the year problem 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company and jm ney are exposed to market risk from changes in equity security prices  certain commodity prices  interest rates and from factors that impact equity investment in russia  the ukraine and poland 
equity securities risk at february   the company owned a portfolio of savings bank stock with a market value of  the company has pledged this portfolio to secure short term borrowings of  a decline in the value of these securities  in addition to reducing working capital could cause the company to sell securities or use other sources of funds to reduce the margin loan 
foreign investment risk the company has a trading portfolio of russian  ukraine and polish investments with a net reported value of  and longer term russian investments with a reported value of  in addition  jm ney has an investment in a russian bond fund with a reported value of  the realizable value of these investments  particularly russian components  is subject to currency fluctuations  illiquid markets and political risks 
the company has no derivative financials instruments to hedge the risks associated with these investments 
commodity price risk jm ney utilizes significant amounts of precious metals in the products it manufactures and sells 
significant increases in the market value of these metals  palladium  gold and platinum  in particular  may impact the demand for its products 
jm ney generally adjusts the selling prices of its products if market prices change significantly  or it hedges fixed selling price programs 
accordingly  while a change in precious metals prices may impact cost of sales  such impact is generally met with an approximately equivalent charge in sales  so that the impact on earnings is minimal or not present 
significant fluctuations and volatility in precious metal price creates risk that purchases of precious metals may not be efficiently coordinated with sales 
while jm ney believes it has the programs in place to limit this risk  there can be no assurance that volatility in price does not result in intended profits or losses 
also  while increases or decreases in precious metal prices impact the economic value of jm ney s inventory  such changes are generally reflected with a corresponding change in the lifo reserve and do not affect the net reported value of its inventory 
interest rate risk jm ney has a revolving line of credit which bears interest at floating rates as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company has short term borrowings in the form of a margin loan 
neither the company nor jm ney hedges its interest rate risk  including the note associated with precious metal consignment arrangements which are tied to precious metal leasing 
a change in interest rates would impact the company s interest cost of its short term borrowings by approximately  during most of fy  jm ney did not have outstanding cash borrowings on its revolving line of credit  thus a change in interest rates would have a minimal impact on reported interest expense 
most of jm ney s usage of its credit line is in the form of consignment borrowings of precious metals  much of which hedge precious metals inventory represented by scrap metal of its refining operations 
a change in precious metal leasing rates would impact jm ney s interest cost by approximately  much of which would be offset by changes in market risk surcharges to us refining customers 
such leasing costs are also impacted by charges in the market prices for the precious metals being leased 
during fy the leasing rates and market prices for palladium fluctuated significantly 
leasing costs ranged from a high of per annum to a low of  with an unweighted average of approximately 
market prices for palladium contacts ranged from per troy ounce to per troy ounce 
as a result  daily lease costs for palladium ranged from approximately per ounce to approximately per ounce 
the company passed these metal fluctuations and market sensitive lease costs to us refining customers  in the form of charges that are included in other income 
accordingly  the net impact of such fluctuations is estimated to not be material to the company s consolidated results of operations 
due to the interest risk of financing and managing precious metals inventory  there can be no assurance that changes in either or both precious metals prices or leasing rates will not have a material impact on future results of operations
