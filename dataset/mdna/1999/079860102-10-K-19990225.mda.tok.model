treasury share purchases totaled  during in november  bellsouth announced its intent to repurchase up to  of its common stock during bellsouth expects to finance the repurchase primarily through cash generated from operations 
bellsouth s debt to total capitalization ratio was at december   compared to at december  and at december  market risk bellsouth is exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to manage this exposure  bellsouth employs risk management strategies including the use of derivatives such as interest rate swap agreements  foreign currency forwards and currency swap agreements 
bellsouth does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
bellsouth s objective in managing interest rate risk is to maintain a balance of fixed and variable rate debt that will lower its overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps are used to convert a portion of bellsouth s debt portfolio from a variable rate to a fixed rate or from a fixed rate to a variable rate 
foreign exchange risk 
bellsouth s objective in managing foreign exchange risk is to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates 
short term foreign currency transactions and commitments expose bellsouth to changes in foreign exchange rates 
bellsouth occasionally enters into forward contracts and similar instruments to mitigate the potential impacts of such risks 
bellsouth s equity investments in brazil hold approximately  in us dollar denominated liabilities and recognize foreign currency gains or losses when converting those liabilities into local currency 
bellsouth s equity income related to these investments is subject to fluctuations in the us dollar brazilian real exchange rate 
see md a operating environment international operations 
bellsouth is subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for its international operations which use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated to us dollars 
such changes result in cumulative translation adjustments which are included in shareholders equity 
at december   bellsouth had translation exposure to various foreign currencies with the most significant being the brazilian real and the german mark 
operations in countries with hyperinflationary economies consider the us dollar the functional currency and reflect translation gains and losses in the determination of net income 
risk sensitivity 
bellsouth s use of derivative financial instruments is designed to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risks  although to some extent they expose bellsouth to credit risks 
the credit risks associated with these instruments are controlled through the evaluation and continual monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
in the event that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract or agreement  bellsouth s exposure is limited to the then current value of the currency rate or interest rate differential  not the full notional or contract amount 
such contracts and agreements have been executed with creditworthy financial institutions  and as such  bellsouth considers the risk of nonperformance to be remote 
the following table provides information  by maturity date  about bellsouth s interest rate sensitive financial instruments  which consist of fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
fair values for the majority of bellsouth s long term debt obligations are based on quotes from dealers 
total recorded thereafter amount fair value debt fixed rate debt     average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate operating environment and trends of the business regulation bellsouth s future operations and financial results will be substantially influenced by developments in a number of federal and state regulatory proceedings 
adverse results in these proceedings could materially affect bellsouth s revenues and expenses and its ability to compete effectively against other telecommunications carriers 
federal policies being implemented by the federal communications commission fcc strongly favor access reform  whereby the historical subsidy for local service that is contained in network access charges paid by long distance carriers is eliminated 
unless compensatory changes are adopted  such as universal service fund contribution mandates  bellsouth s revenues from this source  which constituted of its revenues during  are at risk 
in addition  other aspects of access charge regulation and universal service fund contribution requirements that are applicable to local service carriers such as bellsouth are also under consideration and could result in greater expense levels or reduced revenues 
as a result of litigation challenging a number of the fcc s rulings under the act  the us supreme court has ruled that the fcc has considerable authority to establish many pricing  interconnection and other policies that have been considered within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state public service commissions 
bellsouth expects the fcc to accelerate the growth of local service competition by aggressively utilizing such power to require interconnection with competing carriers and the sale of network elements to competitors who wish to provide communications services to customers in bellsouth s region 
bellsouth has petitioned the fcc for permission under the act to offer full long distance services 
the fcc has denied all of bellsouth s petitions 
bellsouth expects that the fcc will require further changes in bellsouth s network interconnection elements and operating systems before it will approve such petitions 
such changes will result in significant additional expenses and promote local service competition 
bellsouth s intrastate prices are regulated under price regulation plans provided by statute or approved by state public service commissions 
appeals of approvals of plans in south carolina and tennessee are pending 
some plans are subject to periodic review and require renewal  with several plans scheduled for renewal during these commissions generally required price reductions and other concessions from bellsouth as a condition to approving these plans  and there is no assurance that the commissions will not require further modifications when they consider their renewal 
bellsouth telecommunications is involved in numerous legal proceedings associated with state and federal regulatory matters  the disposition of which could materially impact its operating results and prospects 
see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
competition there are many competitive forces that impact bellsouth s businesses 
the act removed the regulatory barriers to local service competition and required bellsouth to open its network to other carriers 
the auction of pcs licenses has created as many as six new wireless competitors in bellsouth s markets  and the deregulation of international communications markets has introduced new global competitors to nearly all of bellsouth s international businesses 
bellsouth expects local service competition to steadily increase  particularly with respect to its business customers 
while competition for local service revenues could adversely affect bellsouth s results of operations  opening of local markets can lead to qualification to offer in region interlata long distance wireline services 
the presence of multiple aggressive competitors in bellsouth s domestic and international wireless markets makes it more difficult to attract new customers and retain existing ones 
furthermore  while bellsouth does not compete primarily on the basis of price  low prices offered by competitors attempting to obtain market share have pressured bellsouth to reduce prices and develop pricing plans attractive to lower usage customers 
these trends are expected to continue and could adversely affect bellsouth s results of operations in the future 
bellsouth plans to compete through aggressive marketing  competitive pricing and technical innovation 
it will offer consumers a full range of services local  long distance  internet access  wireless and more while remaining committed to its high level of customer service and value 
technology bellsouth is continually upgrading its networks with digital and optical technologies  making it capable of delivering a full complement of voice and data services 
this modernization of the network is critical to bellsouth s success in providing the data connectivity demanded by its customers and to compete with fiber networks being constructed or currently utilized by start ups and cable companies 
this effort will require investment of significant amounts of capital in the future 
bellsouth believes that its dual mode network with its extended coverage currently provides a significant competitive advantage over pcs providers 
digital wireless technology  however  is rapidly evolving and the development of a common roaming platform for digital wireless technologies could reduce this advantage 
this would result in more intense competition and could have an adverse effect on bellsouth s results of operations 
international operations bellsouth owns significant interests in a number of foreign operations  primarily in latin america  which are subject to greater political  monetary  economic and regulatory risks than its domestic businesses 
in particular  bellsouth holds equity interests in two wireless communications consortia in brazil  which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
at december   the brazilian operations had incurred approximately  in us dollar denominated liabilities 
during january the brazilian government allowed its currency to trade freely against other currencies resulting in an immediate devaluation of the brazilian real 
for january  the latest internal financial reporting period  bellsouth will recognize a foreign exchange rate loss resulting from the devaluation of approximately through recording its share of equity in earnings of its brazilian equity investments 
the aforementioned exchange loss is subject to further upward or downward adjustment based on fluctuations in the us dollar brazilian real exchange rate 
the impact of the devaluation on an operation depends on the devaluation s effect on the local economy and the ability of an operation to raise prices and or reduce expenses 
additionally  the economies of other countries in latin america could be adversely impacted by brazil s economic and monetary problems 
the likelihood and extent of further devaluation and deteriorating economic conditions in brazil and other latin american countries and the resulting impacts on bellsouth s results of operations  financial position and cash flows is not known 
year readiness disclosure bellsouth has initiated a company wide program to identify and address issues associated with the ability of its date sensitive information  telephony and business systems and certain equipment to properly recognize the year as a result of the century change on january  the program is also designed to assess the readiness of other entities with which bellsouth does business 
inability to reach substantial year compliance in bellsouth s systems and integral third party systems could result in interruption of telecommunications services  interruption or failure of bellsouth s customer billing  operating and other information systems and failure of certain date sensitive equipment 
such failures could result in substantial claims by customers as well as loss of revenue due to service interruption  delays in bellsouth s ability to bill its customers accurately and timely  and increased expenses associated with litigation  stabilization of operations following such failures or execution of contingency plans 
the year program is being conducted by a management team that is coordinating efforts of internal resources as well as third party providers and vendors in identifying and making necessary changes to bellsouth s systems hardware  software and date sensitive equipment 
the program also includes the international and domestic companies in which bellsouth holds an interest 
some of the changes that are necessary in bellsouth s operations are being made as a part of ongoing systems upgrades 
bellsouth s year program has been divided into six phases planning  inventory  impact analysis  conversion  testing  and implementation 
bellsouth monitors its progress within these six phases based on the number of inventoried items that have been addressed 
management s target date for completion of all phases for most of its mission critical applications is june  mission critical applications include those that directly affect delivery of primary services to bellsouth s customers  directly affect bellsouth revenue recognition and collection  would create noncompliance with any statutes or laws  and would require significant costs to address in the event of noncompliance 
bellsouth has identified three main areas of focus for its year program 
each focus area includes the hardware  software  embedded chips  third party vendors and suppliers as well as third party networks that are associated with the identified systems 
the first focus area  network components  consists of the switches  transmission systems and associated software that comprise the core of bellsouth s telephony systems including land line and wireless domestic and international services 
outside suppliers provide all hardware and most software that comprise bellsouth s networks  these components are being remediated by those third party suppliers 
testing of these components for year compliance is being performed by the vendors  bellsouth  and industry groups such as the telco year forum 
as of december   the planning  inventory and impact analysis phases for bellsouth telecommunications were complete with the remaining phases each approximately complete 
the planning  inventory and impact analysis phases for bellsouth s other domestic operations were each almost complete with the remaining phases each more than complete 
the planning  inventory and impact analysis phases for bellsouth s international operations were each approximately complete with the remaining phases each approximately complete 
the second focus area  information technology systems  consists of those systems that primarily support customer care operations such as order taking and billing 
the software for these systems was developed by both bellsouth and vendors  and is being remediated and tested by both 
as of december   the planning  inventory and impact analysis phases for bellsouth telecommunications were each approximately complete with the remaining phases each approximately complete 
the planning  inventory and impact analysis phases for bellsouth s other domestic operations were each almost complete with the remaining phases each approximately complete 
the planning  inventory and impact analysis phases for bellsouth s international operations were each approximately complete with the remaining phases each approximately complete 
building and environmental systems  the third focus area  includes various products and systems that are not used in support of network or customer care functions 
building and environmental systems are primarily provided by third parties and include building operations  office equipment  utilities  etc 
as of december   the planning  inventory and impact analysis phases for bellsouth telecommunications were each almost complete with the remaining phases each approximately complete 
the planning  inventory and impact analysis phases for bellsouth s other domestic operations were each almost complete with the remaining phases each approximately complete 
bellsouth s international operations are currently in the planning  inventory and impact analysis phases for their environmental systems 
bellsouth has developed numerous contingency plans for conducting its business operations in the event of crises including system outages and natural disasters 
as a part of its year compliance efforts  bellsouth has chartered a year business continuity project to ensure that tested contingency plans are in place in the event that planned year compliance activities for its mission critical applications are not successfully accomplished 
this effort is not limited to the risks posed by the potential year failures of internal information systems and infrastructures  but also includes the potential secondary impact on bellsouth of year failures  including potential systems failures of business partners and infrastructure service providers 
a master year contingency planning guide and associated workbook have been developed and internal training has been completed 
other major milestones for the contingency planning project include assessments by the end of first quarter  and the completion of testing and sign off of contingency plans during third quarter additionally  bellsouth is a member  together with other large telecommunications companies  of several industry groups that are addressing the year issue and related contingency plans 
some of the costs associated with bellsouth s year compliance efforts were incurred in and the remainder has been or will be incurred during and costs are not incurred equally over all phases of the project  but increase over time 
bellsouth anticipates that the conversion and testing phases will require an increase in spending over the earlier phases of the project 
as of december   approximately of external costs had been expended towards year compliance 
bellsouth estimates the total external cost of its compliance efforts will be between and over the life of the project 
bellsouth intends to continually reassess the estimated costs and status of year remediation efforts 
bellsouth currently anticipates that most of its mission critical applications will be year compliant by june  however  no assurance can be given that unforeseen circumstances will not arise during the performance of the testing and implementation phases that would adversely affect the year compliance of bellsouth s systems 
furthermore  the year compliance status of integral third party suppliers and networks  which could adversely impact bellsouth s mission critical applications  cannot be fully known 
as a result  bellsouth is unable to determine the impact that any system interruption would have on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
cwa contracts in september  members of the communications workers of america cwa ratified new three year contracts with bellsouth  effective august  the contracts include basic wage increases totaling over the three years covered by the contracts 
in addition  the agreement provides for a standard award of between and of base salary and overtime compensation which is subject to adjustment based on company performance measures for plan years and other terms of the agreement include pension band increases and pension plan cash balance improvements for active employees 
new accounting pronouncements accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the standard requires that all derivative instruments be recognized as assets or liabilities and be adjusted to fair value each period 
bellsouth will adopt sfas no 
on january  and is currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on its results of operations and financial position 
capitalization of internal use software 
in march  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires capitalization of certain direct costs and interest costs after preliminary development efforts have been made 
bellsouth adopted sop on january  adoption of sop will result in a temporary increase in earnings in the year of adoption  compared to the prior period  as a result of the capitalization of costs which had previously been expensed 
bellsouth currently believes that this increase will be approximately to to after tax for if expenditures remain at a consistent level  the comparative earnings impact will decline in each year following the change 
the decline will continue until the amortization expense related to the capitalized software costs equals the level of software costs treated as expense prior to the change 
in addition  adoption of sop will result in higher levels of capitalized software costs on the consolidated balance sheets 
safe harbor statement statements that do not address historical performance are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and are based on a number of assumptions  including but not limited to continued domestic economic growth and demand for bellsouth s services  economic  monetary  regulatory and political stability where bellsouth conducts its international operations  the reasonable accuracy of bellsouth s expectations of the impact on its international operations of weakening currencies in latin america as compared to the us dollar  the reasonable accuracy of bellsouth s expectations of the results of regulatory actions as well as costs and recoveries with respect to access reform  universal service and interconnection  the reasonable accuracy of bellsouth s estimate of regulatory authorization to provide wireline long distance services and the impact of competition in its markets  and satisfactory identification and completion of year software and hardware revisions by bellsouth and entities with which it does business 
any developments significantly deviating from these assumptions could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecast or implied in the aforementioned forward looking statements
