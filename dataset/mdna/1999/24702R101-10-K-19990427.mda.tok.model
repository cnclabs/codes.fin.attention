cash flows from operating activities resulted primarily from the company s net income  changes in operating working capital and income tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
throughout fiscal year  the company invested a significant portion of its available cash in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at date of acquisition to primarily minimize principal risk and maintain liquidity 
during fiscal year  the company continued to improve on its efficient asset management 
days of sales in accounts receivable remained flat in fiscal year  while days of supply in inventory decreased one day from fiscal year to six days 
this  combined with a three day increase in days in accounts payable  resulted in an improvement in the company s cash conversion cycle to a negative days in fiscal year from a negative eight days in fiscal year the company s return on invested capital  a key indicator of efficient asset management  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year during fiscal year  the company repurchased million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of billion  primarily to manage the dilution resulting from shares issued under the company s employee stock option and purchase plans

management believes that the company has sufficient resources from cash provided from operations and available borrowings to support its operations and capital requirements for at least the next months 
market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
foreign currency hedging activities the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
accordingly  the company utilizes foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments in most of the foreign countries in which the company operates 
the principal currencies hedged during fiscal year were the british pound  japanese yen  german mark  french franc and canadian dollar 
the company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures daily to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
based on the company s foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at january   the company estimates a maximum potential one day loss in fair value of approximately million  using a value at risk var model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the company used a monte carlo simulation type model that valued its foreign currency instruments against a thousand randomly generated market price paths 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position during fiscal years  and euro conversion the company has evaluated the potential impact of the euro conversion on the company 
the company identified issues related to the euro conversion  including issues related to information systems and business processes  and assessed the effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
also  the company introduced www 
euro 
dell 
com to provide the latest information on the company s euro initiatives  as well as to provide basic tools to assist the company s customers in dealing with the euro conversion 
there can be no assurance that all issues related to the euro conversion have been identified and that any issues will not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
however  the company believes that it has and will continue to take appropriate steps to assess and address euro conversion issues and currently does not expect that its business will be adversely affected by such conversion in any material respect 
marketable securities the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at january   was approximately billion 
the company s investment policy is to manage its marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
the company diversifies the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through the use of different investment brokers 
the company s marketable securities portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
based on the company s marketable securities portfolio and interest rates at january   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of million  respectively  in the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio  however  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
factors affecting the company s business and prospects there are numerous factors that affect the company s business and the results of its operations 
these factors include general economic and business conditions  the level of demand for personal computers  the level and intensity of competition in the computer industry and the pricing pressures that may result  the ability of the company to timely and effectively manage periodic product transitions  as well as component availability  the ability of the company to develop new products based on new or evolving technology and the market s acceptance of those products  the ability of the company to manage its inventory levels to minimize excess inventory  declining inventory values and obsolescence  the product  customer and geographic sales mix of any particular period  the company s ability to continue to improve its infrastructure including personnel and systems to keep pace with the growth in its overall business activities  and the company s ability to ensure its products and internal systems and devices will be year ready and to assess the year readiness and risk to the company of its third party providers  and implement effective contingency plans where needed 
for a discussion of these and other factors affecting the company s business and prospects  see item business factors affecting the company s business and prospects 
year the following disclosure is a year readiness disclosure statement pursuant to the year readiness and disclosure act 
state of readiness the company established a formal year readiness program in february the company s year program consists of two separate initiatives  the millennium project and the product group yk project 
the purpose of the millennium project is to assess the year readiness of the company s component and service providers and the company s internal systems and devices 
the company identified and assessed its internal systems and devices and  where remedial steps were required to make those systems year ready  prioritized the remedial steps to be taken 
as of march   the company had completed its assessment and renovation of all mission critical internal systems and devices and believes all are substantially year ready 
however  because the full ramifications of the year issue will not be fully realized until after the year date change  the company can provide no assurances that its internal systems and devices will not be adversely affected by the year date change 
the company has also identified  through the millennium project  its critical component and service providers and is contacting each such vendor to assess that vendor s year readiness 
the company has assigned each such vendor a priority rating based on the criticality of the function it provides to the company 
the company is assessing the year readiness of each critical vendor 
through march   the company had received written responses from approximately of its critical vendors  and expects to complete a review of all of its critical vendors by no later than june  because the company is relying on information provided to it by third parties to assess the year readiness of such vendors  the company cannot provide assurances that all of its critical vendors are or will be year ready 
therefore  the company cannot provide assurances that the company will not be adversely affected by the year date change 
through the product group yk project  the company is analyzing the year readiness status of the computer hardware manufactured by the company  to provide an effective means of communicating the readiness status to customers  and to implement an ongoing testing and monitoring program to help enable all new dell computer hardware offerings to meet the company s year readiness standards 
the company has analyzed and continues to analyze the year status of the computer hardware manufactured by the company 
all dell branded hardware products shipped after january  meet the company s year readiness standards 
dell branded hardware manufactured prior to that time can generally be updated to meet the company s year readiness standards through bios upgrades or software patches 
the company has created a web site at www 
dell 
com year  which contains detailed information about the year issue  the company s year readiness standards and its year program 
through the web site  customers can assess the year readiness of their hardware and can obtain software patches and bios upgrades from the company  free of charge  to help prepare the hardware for the year rollover 
customers without internet access may request free copies of the software patches and bios upgrades by telephone or mail 
the company s year readiness program applies only to dell branded hardware manufactured and dell branded software developed by the company 
although the company has attempted to ascertain the year status of third party software and peripherals loaded on or distributed with company computer systems  it does not and cannot guarantee the year status of any software or peripherals provided by third parties 
costs the company currently does not expect that the total costs of its year readiness program will be material to its financial condition or results of operation 
all costs are charged to expense as incurred  and do not include potential costs related to any customers or other claims or the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
risks contingency plans the company believes that the most likely worst case scenarios would involve the interruption of crucial suppliers as a result of infrastructure failures or third party vendor failures 
as a result  the company is developing contingency plans that will address each of the most likely worst case scenarios 
such contingency plans are expected to be completed no later than september  the company believes that it is taking appropriate steps to assess and address its year issues and currently does not expect that its business will be adversely affected by the year issue in any material respect 
nevertheless  achieving year readiness is dependent on many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
should either the company s internal systems and devices or the internal systems and devices of one or more critical vendors fail to achieve year readiness  the company s business and its results of operations could be adversely affected
