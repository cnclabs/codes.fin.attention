item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of the company s liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  net investment income and maturing investments 
the company generally experiences positive cash flow resulting from the fact that premiums are collected on insurance policies in advance of the disbursement of funds in payment of claims 
operating costs of the insurance subsidiaries  other than loss and loss expense payments and commissions paid to the parent company  generally average between and of premiums earned on a consolidated basis and the remaining amount is available for investment for varying periods of time depending on the type of insurance coverage provided 
during extended periods of declining premium volume  however  operating cash flows may turn negative as loss settlements exceed net premium revenue and receipts of investment income 
for several years  the company s investment philosophy has emphasized the purchase of short term instruments with maximum quality and liquidity 
as interest rates have remained relatively low and yield curves have been essentially flat in recent years  the company has not committed funds to longer term fixed maturity investments 
recently  however  the company has extended into slightly longer maturity investments in an effort to increase the yield on its portfolio 
as a result  the average life of the company s bond and short term investment portfolio was years compared to years for the company also remains an active participant in the equity securities market 
investments made by the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries are regulated by guidelines promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners that are designed to provide protection for both policyholders and shareholders 
the company s assets at december  included million in short term investments which are readily convertible to cash without market penalty and an additional million of fixed maturity investments maturing in less than one year 
the company believes that these liquid investments  plus the expected cash flow from current operations  are more than sufficient to provide for projected claim payments and operating cost demands 
in addition  the company s reinsurance program is structured to avoid serious cash drains that might accompany catastrophic losses 
in the event competitive conditions continue to produce inadequate rates and the company chooses to further reduce volume  the company believes that the liquidity of its investment portfolio would permit it to continue to pay claims as settlements are reached without requiring the disposal of investments at a loss  regardless of interest rates in effect at the time 
net premiums written by the company s us insurance subsidiaries for were approximately of the combined statutory surplus of these subsidiaries 
premium writings of to of surplus are generally considered acceptable by regulatory authorities 
further  the statutory capital of each of the insurance subsidiaries substantially exceeds minimum risk based capital requirements set by the national association of insurance commissioners 
accordingly  the company has the ability to significantly increase its business without seeking additional capital to meet statutory guidelines 
due primarily to a million decline in unrealized net gains on investments  shareholders equity decreased to million at december   from million at december  the change in shareholders equity also included million in treasury share purchases and million of dividends to shareholders 
book value per common share outstanding decreased to at december  from per share at december as more fully discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements  at december   million  or of shareholders equity  represented net assets of the company s insurance subsidiaries which  at that time  could not be transferred in the form of dividends  loans or advances to the parent company due to statutory restrictions on the allowable transfers 
however  management believes that these restrictions pose no material liquidity concerns for the company 
the financial strength and stability of the subsidiaries permit ready access by the parent company to short term and long term sources of credit 
the parent company had cash and marketable investments of approximately million at december  results of operations compared to direct premiums written for totaled million  an increase of million from this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in nonstandard private passenger automobile business of million from direct premium writings from small trucking fleet risks and fleet trucking s work accident program also increased by million and million  respectively 
the new small business workers compensation program also generated 
million in new premium during these increases were partially offset by decreases in the remainder of the company s trucking related products 
market conditions for the company s large and medium fleet trucking products continued to be competitive during  resulting in further downward pressure on pricing 
in addition  favorable claims development from expired retrospectively rated workers compensation policies reduced direct premium by million in premium writings from reinsurance assumed decreased by million to million during million of this decrease is due to the company not renewing it s participation in an excess facultative program due to unfavorable experience 
premiums assumed from voluntary property catastrophe retrocession pools were also lower during as the result of reductions in the company s shares in these pools during  as well as decreases in gross pool revenues 
premium writings ceded to reinsurers increased million during to million 
the percentage of premiums ceded to direct premiums written increased to for from for  as the company entered into new reinsurance agreements for its fleet trucking products  effective june   whereby it ceded more premiums and retained less risk 
reinsurance retentions were also decreased for the company s small fleet trucking products with no material impact on premium ceded 
after giving effect to changes in unearned premiums  net premiums earned increased to million for from for net premiums earned from all trucking related insurance products  including small fleet trucking  decreased by million 
premiums earned from voluntary reinsurance assumed decreased by million 
the above decreases were offset by a million increase in nonstandard private passenger automobile premium during net investment income increased by 
million during due to higher average invested assets while overall pre tax yields were relatively unchanged 
the average pre tax yield on invested assets was for both and while the after tax yield for was compared to for investment expenses  which are netted directly against income  were relatively unchanged in and were of gross investment income compared to for realized net capital gains were million in compared to million for the current year net gain consisted of gains on equity securities and fixed maturities of million and 
million  respectively  and losses on other investments of 
million 
the lower realized net capital gains during reflect the realization of losses on several under performing issues that were sold during the year 
losses and loss expenses incurred during increased million to million 
the consolidated loss and loss expense ratio was compared to for losses and loss expenses incurred for included adverse development on environmental liability claims of million relating to policies written in the s 
the company has established provisions for incurred but not reported environmental losses at december  that are believed to be sufficient to cover all anticipated exposure 
adjusted for the development on environmental liability claims  the consolidated loss and loss expense ratio for was 
the decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio is principally attributable to an increase in the savings realized on the closing of prior year claims during as compared to these savings related predominantly to the company s trucking and trucking related business 
because of the high limits provided by the company to its insureds  the length of time required to settle larger  more complex claims and the volatility of the trucking liability insurance business  the company believes it is important to have a high degree of comfort in its reserving process 
as claims are settled in years subsequent to their occurrence  the company s claim handling process has  historically  tended to produce savings from the reserves provided 
the company believes that the favorable loss development may be attributable  at least in part  to changes in trucking safety in general resulting from the implementation of the national commercial driver license  mandatory drug testing and an increased awareness by trucking companies of the cost of unsafe operations 
it is further believed that the company s selection techniques  minimum safety standards and claims handling have also contributed to the current favorable loss experience 
other operating expenses for  before credits for allowances from reinsurers  increased million to million 
personnel related expenses  including amounts allocated to loss expenses and investment income  were essentially unchanged from levels despite a net increase in the number of employees during the year  attributable to the expansion of the company s new products 
salary expense for was reduced as the result of lower accruals for equity appreciation rights which represent a broad based employee incentive program which is tied to changes in the company s book value 
direct commission expense increased million as the result of increases in premiums from sagamore s personal automobile  small fleet and small business workers compensation products 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in voluntary reinsurance assumed from catastrophe pools 
allowances from reinsurers increased million resulting from new reinsurance agreements entered into in which provide ceding commissions to protective on its fleet trucking business 
previous reinsurance treaties covering protective s fleet trucking business carried no ceding commission 
the ratio of net operating expenses of the insurance subsidiaries to net premiums earned was during compared to for including the agency operations  which absorbed a portion of the development costs for the company s new products  the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue  adjusted to remove net realized gains  was for compared with for expenses for and include expenditures for year yk compliance  as discussed more thoroughly elsewhere in this discussion 
while it is not possible to precisely isolate yk expenditures from those for ongoing development of current product lines  management believes that amounts spent during for yk related issues were higher than expenditures during the effective federal tax rate for consolidated operations for was 
this rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily because of tax exempt investment income 
as a result of the factors mentioned above  net income from consolidated operations for was million compared to million for diluted earnings per share decreased to in from in due primarily to the decrease in realized gains on investments 
diluted earnings per share from operations before realized gains on investments was in compared to 
in compared to direct premiums written for totaled million  an increase of million from this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in nonstandard private passenger automobile business of million from offset by decreases in the majority of the company s trucking related products although work accident program premiums increased million from premium writings from small trucking fleet risks also increased by 
million while the new small business workers compensation program generated 
million in new premium 
large and medium fleet trucking premium writings declined million and 
million  respectively  reflecting the continued intense competition in these markets 
in addition  premiums for large deductible workers compensation policies decreased million 
premium writings from reinsurance assumed increased by million to million during this increase is due principally to million relating to the company s participation in a new excess facultative program  partially offset by lower premiums assumed from voluntary property catastrophe retrocession pools during the decreased catastrophe assumed premium is attributable to reductions in the company s shares in these pools during as well as decreases in gross pool revenues 
premium writings ceded to reinsurers decreased million during to million 
the percentage of premiums ceded to direct premiums written decreased to for from for due primarily to the decline in trucking related premiums which carry larger reinsurance rates than the company s other products and the increased use of lower cost facultative placements 
in addition  ceded premium declined due to the termination of the quota share treaty on the company s work accident program in april  ceding rates on the company s primary treaties for were consistent with the prior year 
after giving effect to changes in unearned premiums  net premiums earned increased to million for from for net premiums earned from all trucking related insurance products  including small fleet trucking  decreased by million 
premiums earned from voluntary reinsurance assumed decreased by 
million 
the above decreases were offset by a million increase in nonstandard private passenger automobile premium during net investment income decreased by million during due to across the board declines in the pre tax yields on invested assets

federal income tax considerations the liability method is used in accounting for federal income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the provision for deferred federal income tax was based on items of income and expense that were reported in different years in the financial statements and tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the difference originated 
net deferred tax liabilities of million and million were recorded at december  and  respectively 
the net deferred tax liability at december  included million in special tax deposits covered under section of the internal revenue code  as explained in the following paragraph  which compares to million in special tax deposits at december  adjusted for the special deposits  a net deferred tax liability of million was recorded at december  compared to a net deferred tax liability of million at december  the decrease in deferred federal taxes payable is primarily attributable to changes in unrealized capital gains in the investment portfolio 
a provision in the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of created a mechanism which would allow for a recognizable deferred tax asset specifically for property and casualty loss reserves discounted for tax purposes 
adopted as section of the internal revenue code  this provision allows an insurer to take a special tax deduction equal to the discount on post accident year loss and loss expense reserves while making special estimated tax payments equal to the amount of the tax benefit derived from the special deduction 
the special estimated tax payments can be carried forward for fifteen years to offset taxes arising from decreases in the special deduction and can be treated as regular estimated payments or refunded at the end of the carryforward period 
based upon the concerns regarding the recognition of deferred tax assets  the company adopted the provisions of section for all tax years and subsequent and has taken deductions for the entire amount of discount on post loss reserves 
as mentioned above  special section estimated tax deposits totaling million have been paid in connection with this election 
impact of inflation to the extent possible  the company attempts to recover the costs of inflation by increasing the premiums it charges 
a majority of the company s premiums are charged as a percentage of an insured s gross revenue or payroll 
as these charging bases increase with inflation  so does premium 
the remaining premium rates charged are adjustable only at periodic intervals and often require state regulatory approval 
such periodic increases in premium rates may lag far behind cost increases 
to the extent inflation influences yields on investments  the company is also affected 
the company maintains a sizable portion of its investment portfolio in short term instruments and changes in current market interest rates correspondingly affect yields on these investments 
further  as inflation affects current market rates of return  previously committed investments may rise or decline in value depending on the type and maturity of investment 
inflation must also be considered by the company in the creation and review of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves since portions of these reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
impact of the year note anticipated costs of the company s year project  as provided in the following discussion  are based on management s estimates of ultimate total costs and percentages of completion with respect to each phase of the project 
these anticipated costs have not been audited by our independent auditors 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive features may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
the insurance industry is especially aware of the year concern given that the majority of its products and services are time and date sensitive eg  policy effective periods and loss occurrence dates 
the company has been in the process of developing software for its new and rapidly expanding products since all internally developed new product software is year compliant  with minor exceptions  and currently handles approximately of the company s processed transactions 
the company is also engaged in an ongoing analysis of its remaining systems to determine the nature and extent of existing deficiencies and the appropriate corrective solutions 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a significant impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
to date  the company has completed is assessment of all mission critical systems and continues to evaluate the needs to repair or replace non mission critical systems 
the completed assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems could be affected  particularly with respect to policy and claim processing  billing  general ledger and cash receipts and disbursements systems 
to date  the company s general ledger system and the portions of the remaining systems that handle approximately of the company s transactions are fully year ready 
the company has communicated with its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to third party failures to remediate year system deficiencies 
currently  there is no known third party year deficiency believed to pose a serious threat to the company s ability to conduct business 
it is believed that the company s total year project costs will not be significantly impacted by third party year issues based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be converted on a timely basis and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company has determined it has no significant exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company will continue to utilize existing staff and other internal resources to reprogram and test its internally developed software  and to test its purchased software  for year compliance 
any internally developed software that is deemed unworthy of year conversion will be replaced with new internally developed or purchased software that is year compliant 
any currently owned purchased software for which year upgrades are unavailable will also be replaced with purchased software that is year compliant 
the company anticipates completing the year project by june  the majority of the past and future costs associated with the year project can be attributed to internal staffing requirements associated with the development of new product software and would have largely been incurred regardless of the year issue 
these costs  and the costs associated with the acquisition of year compliant software from outside vendors  are not material with respect to the company s operations or financial position 
the costs associated with the year project can be categorized into three basic areas internal resources  mainly programming and technical personnel  used to correct internally developed software 
the estimated total cost of this area is anticipated to be approximately million with of this amount relating to future costs 
replacement or upgrade of purchased software 
the estimated total cost of this area is anticipated to be approximately million with of this amount relating to future costs 
upgrading equipment 
most of the hardware replacements and upgrades to date have not been due to the year issue 
more than of the company s network equipment has been replaced over the last eighteen months and all mainframe hardware is less than three years old 
future hardware costs should not exceed 
million 
management believes it has an effective program in place to resolve all year issues in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year project 
in the unlikely event that the company does not complete all additional phases of this project  the company may be unable to process policy and claim transactions on certain of its less transaction volume intensive products 
currently  the company has no contingency plans in place in the event this occurs 
however  the company will evaluate the status of completion of its year project by june  and determine whether such a contingency plan is necessary 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete its year effort are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
market risk the company operates solely within the property and casualty insurance industry and  accordingly  has significant invested assets which are exposed to various market risks 
these market risks relate to interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency translation and equities market prices 
all of the company s invested assets are classified as available for sale and are listed as such in the enclosed consolidated financial statements in note b 
the most significant of the three identified market risks relates to prices in the equities market 
though not the largest category of the company s invested assets  equity securities have the greatest potential for short term price fluctuation 
the market value of the company s equity positions at december  was million or approximately of invested assets  including money market instruments classified as cash 
funds invested in the equities market are not considered to be assets necessary for the company to conduct its daily operations and  therefore  can be committed for extended periods of time 
the long term nature of the company s equity investments allows it to invest in positions where ultimate value  and not short term market fluctuations  are the most important feature 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio totaled million at december  and is heavily weighted toward u 
s 
government and government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities 
over of this portfolio matures within years and the average life of the company s fixed maturity investments is approximately years 
although the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its fixed maturity investments  given the anticipated duration of the company s liabilities principally insurance loss and loss expense reserves relative to maturities  even a to basis point increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the company s ability to conduct daily operations or to meet its obligations 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
forward looking information any forward looking statements in this report  including without limitation  statements relating to the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions and adequacy of resources  are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including without limitation the following i the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations and intentions are subject to change at any time at the discretion of the company  ii the company s business is highly competitive and the entrance of new competitors into or the expansion of the operations by existing competitors in the company s markets and other changes in the market for insurance products could adversely affect the company s plans and results of operations  and iii other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission
