kronos believes that the tio industry has long term growth potential  as discussed in item business kronos industry and competition 
net sales and operating income years ended december  change in millions net sales kronos operating income kronos 
percent change in tio sales volume average selling prices in billing currencies 
kronos operating income for more than doubled due to higher average tio selling prices  partially offset by lower sales volume and million of income from refunds of german trade capital taxes  discussed below 
in billing currency terms  kronos average tio selling prices were higher than in average selling prices in the fourth quarter of were higher than the fourth quarter of and even with the third quarter of selling prices at the end of were higher than year end levels 
kronos operating income in was higher than  primarily due to record production and sales volumes and the german trade capital tax income  partially offset by lower average tio selling prices 
the million of german trade capital tax refunds received in relates to years prior to and includes interest 
the german tax authorities were required to remit refunds based on i recent court decisions which reduced the trade capital tax base and ii prior agreements between the company and the german tax authorities regarding payment of disputed taxes 
kronos cost of sales in was lower than due to lower sales volume 
kronos cost of sales in was lower than due to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and lower unit costs  primarily due to higher production levels  partially offset by higher sales volumes 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of increased average selling prices and decreased in primarily due to lower unit costs 
kronos selling  general and administrative expenses declined in from the previous year due to lower distribution expenses related to lower sales volume and favorable effects of foreign currency translation  while expenses were lower than as a result of favorable effects of foreign currency translation and german trade capital tax refunds  partially offset by higher distribution expenses associated with higher sales volumes 
sales volume of  metric tons of tio in was lower than the record sales volume in reflecting lower sales volume in asia and latin america 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales  by volume  were attributable to markets in europe with approximately attributable to north america  approximately to asia and the balance to other regions 
industry wide demand was lower in the first half of  kronos believes  due to customer destocking inventories 
kronos reduced its production rates to manage its inventory levels  and its average capacity utilization was approximately in demand improved in the second half of  and was strong throughout and the first half of  before moderating in the second half of kronos expects industry demand in will be relatively unchanged from  but this will depend upon global economic conditions 
kronos produced near full capacity in and  but is curtailing production in to a level not to exceed kronos expected sales volume 
kronos outlook for average tio selling prices in is uncertain 
notwithstanding the uncertain outlook for tio prices in  kronos anticipates its operating income will be lower than due to lower production levels 
the company has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally germany  norway  belgium and canada 
the us dollar translated value of the company s foreign sales and operating costs is subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period revenues and expenses 
a significant amount of the company s sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in  principally major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
certain purchases of raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies decreased sales by million and million during and  respectively  compared to the year earlier period 
fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted the company s operating expenses and the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income comparisons was not significant in or general corporate the following table sets forth certain information regarding general corporate income expense 
years ended december  change in millions securities earnings 
corporate expenses  net interest expense securities earnings fluctuate in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
average funds invested in was higher than primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of rheox in january the company expects security earnings in will be lower than  due to lower average levels of funds available for investment due to the repayment of certain of the company s debt in corporate expenses  net in were lower than  primarily due to the million noncash charge taken in related to the company s adoption of sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this charge is included in selling  general and administrative expense for in the company s consolidated statements of income 
excluding this charge  corporate expenses  net were slightly lower than due to the recognition of million of income in related to the straight line  five year amortization of million of deferred income received in conjunction with the sale of rheox  partially offset by million of expenses in related to the unsuccessful acquisition of certain tio businesses and assets of tioxide 
corporate expenses  net in exceeded that of  primarily due to the aforementioned million noncash charge taken in interest expense interest expense in declined compared to principally due to prepayments of outstanding indebtedness  principally the senior secured discount notes  the joint venture term loan and a portion of kronos deutsche mark denominated debt 
interest expense declined in from due to lower levels of kronos dm denominated debt  partially offset by higher variable interest rates on such debt 
assuming no significant increase in interest rates  interest expense in is expected to be lower compared to due to lower levels of outstanding indebtedness  including required payments on the dm term loan 
provision for income taxes the principal reasons for the difference between the us federal statutory income tax rates and the company s effective income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s operations are conducted on a worldwide basis and the geographic mix of income can significantly impact the company s effective income tax rate 
in and the geographic mix of income  including losses in certain jurisdictions for which no current refund was available and recognition of a deferred tax asset was not considered appropriate  contributed to the company s effective tax rate varying from a normally expected rate 
in the company s effective tax rate varied from the normally expected rate due predominantly to the recognition of certain deductible tax attributes which previously did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria and the one time effect of a refund of german withholding taxes 
the company s deferred income tax status at december  is discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources the company s consolidated cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three years are presented below

the company s estimated and capital expenditures are million and million  respectively  and include million and million  respectively  in the area of environmental protection and compliance

based upon the company s expectations for the tio industry and anticipated demands on the company s cash resources as discussed herein  the company expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its near term obligations including operations  capital expenditures and debt service 
to the extent that actual developments differ from company s expectations  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected 
certain of the company s tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions are being examined and tax authorities have proposed or may propose tax deficiencies  including non income tax related items and interest 
the company previously reached an agreement with the german tax authorities and paid certain tax deficiencies of approximately dm million million when paid  including interest  which resolved significant tax contingencies for years through in the third quarter of  the company received a dm million million when received refund of german dividend withholding taxes 
the german tax authorities were required to refund such amounts based on a german supreme court decision in favor of another taxpayer 
the refund resulted in a reduction of the settlement amount from dm million referred to above to dm million for years through no further withholding tax refunds are expected 
certain other significant german tax contingencies aggregating an estimated dm million million at december  through remain outstanding and are in litigation 
of these  one primary issue represents disputed amounts aggregating dm million million at december  for years through the company has received tax assessments for a substantial portion of these amounts 
no payments of tax or interest deficiencies related to these assessments are expected until the litigation is resolved 
during a german tax court proceeding involving a tax issue substantially the same as this issue was decided in favor of the taxpayer 
the german tax authorities appealed that decision to the german supreme court which in february rendered its judgment in favor of the taxpayer 
the company believes that the german supreme court s judgment should determine the outcome of the company s primary dispute with the german tax authorities 
based on this recent favorable judgment  the company will request that the tax assessments be withdrawn 
the company has granted a dm million million at december  lien on its nordenham  germany tio plant in favor of the city of leverkusen related to this tax contingency  and a dm million million at december  lien in favor of the german federal tax authorities for other tax contingencies 
if the german tax authorities withdraw their assessments based on the german supreme court s decision  the company expects to request the release of the dm million lien in favor of the city of leverkusen 
in addition  during the company reached an agreement with the german tax authorities regarding certain other issues not in litigation for the years through  and agreed to pay additional tax deficiencies of dm million million at december   most of which was paid in the third quarter of during the company received a tax assessment from the norwegian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  relating to the company has appealed this assessment and has begun litigation proceedings 
during the company was informed by the norwegian tax authorities that additional tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  will likely be proposed for the year the company intends to vigorously contest this issue and litigate  if necessary 
although the company believes that it will ultimately prevail  the company has granted a lien for the tax assessment on its fredrikstad  norway tio plant in favor of the norwegian tax authorities and will be required to grant security on the assessment when received 
no assurance can be given that these tax matters will be resolved in the company s favor in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court proceedings 
the company believes that it has provided adequate accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
at december  the company had net deferred tax liabilities of million 
the company operates in numerous tax jurisdictions  in certain of which it has temporary differences that net to deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 
the company has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at december   principally related to the us and germany  partially offsetting deferred tax assets which the company believes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition to the chemicals business conducted through kronos  the company also has certain interests and associated liabilities relating to certain discontinued or divested businesses  and holdings of marketable equity securities including securities issued by valhi and other contran subsidiaries 
the company has been named as a defendant  prp  or both  in a number of legal proceedings associated with environmental matters  including waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by the company  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant 
the company believes it has adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but the company s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs and the allocation of such costs among prps 
the company is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage arising out of the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
there is no assurance that the company will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  the company believes that the pending lead pigment and paint litigation is without merit 
the company has not accrued any amounts for such pending litigation 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
the company currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes  individually or in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurance that additional matters of these types will not arise in the future 
see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed above  the company has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of the company s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
the carrying value of the company s net investment in its german operations is a net liability due principally to its dm credit facility  while its net investment in its other non us operations are net assets 
the company is in the process of evaluating and upgrading its computer systems both information technology it systems and non it systems involving embedded chip technology and software applications collectively referred to as systems to ensure that the systems function properly beginning january  to achieve its year compliance plan  the company is utilizing internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its systems 
the company has conducted an inventory of its it systems worldwide and is currently testing the systems and applications that have been corrected or reprogrammed for year compliance 
the company has completed a preliminary inventory of its non it systems and is in the process of validating the inventory and correcting or replacing date deficient systems 
the remediation effort is well under way on all critical it and non it systems  and the company anticipates that remediation of such critical systems will be substantially complete by march  and that remediation and testing of all remaining systems will be complete by september once systems undergo remediation  they are tested for year compliance 
for critical systems  the testing process usually involves subjecting the remediated system to a simulated change of date from the year to the year using  in many cases  computer resources 
the company uses a number of packaged software products that have been upgraded to a year compliant version in the normal course of business 
excluding the cost of these software upgrades  the company s cost of becoming year compliant is expected to be approximately million  of which about one half has been spent through december  the company has identified approximately major computer systems and assessed them for year compliance 
at december   approximately of the systems are year compliant 
each operating unit has responsibility for its own conversion  in line with overall guidance and oversight provided by a corporate level coordinator  and the status of each of the remaining systems will be specifically tracked and monitored 
as part of its year compliance plan  the company has requested confirmations from its major domestic and foreign software vendors  hardware vendors  primary suppliers and major customers  that they are developing and implementing plans to become  or are  year compliant 
confirmations received to date from the company s software vendors  hardware vendors  primary suppliers and major customers  indicate that generally they are in the process of implementing remediation plans to ensure that their systems are compliant by december  the major software vendors used by the company have already delivered year compliant software 
notwithstanding these efforts  the ability of the company to affect the year preparedness of such vendors  suppliers and customers is limited 
the company is developing a contingency plan to address potential year related business interruptions that may occur on january   or thereafter 
this plan is expected to be completed in the second quarter of although the company expects its systems to be year compliant before december   it cannot predict the outcome or success of the year compliance programs of its vendors  suppliers  and customers 
the company also cannot predict whether its major software vendors  who continue to test for year compliance  will find additional problems that would result in unplanned upgrades of their applications after december  as a result of these uncertainties  the company cannot predict the impact on its financial condition or results of noncompliant year systems that the company directly or indirectly relies upon 
should the company s year compliance plan not be successful or be delayed beyond january  or should one or more vendors  suppliers or customers fail to adequately address their year issues  the consequences to the company could be far reaching and material  including an inability to produce tio at its manufacturing facilities  which could lead to an indeterminate amount of lost revenue 
other potential negative consequences could include plant malfunction  impeded communications or power supplies  or slower transaction processing and financial reporting 
although not anticipated  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of failure by the company or its key suppliers or customers to become year compliant would be a short term slowdown or cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more of the company s facilities and a short term inability on the part of the company to process orders and billings in a timely manner  and to deliver product to customers 
beginning january   eleven of the fifteen members of the european union eu  including germany  belgium  the netherlands and france  adopted a new european currency unit the euro as their common legal currency 
following the introduction of the euro  the participating countries national currencies remain legal tender as denominations of the euro from january  through january   and the exchange rates between the euro and such national currency units are fixed 
the company conducts substantial operations in europe 
the functional currency of the company s german  belgian  dutch and french operations will convert to the euro from their respective national currencies over a two year period beginning in the euro conversion may impact the company s operations including  among other things  changes in product pricing decisions necessitated by cross border price transparencies 
such changes in product pricing decisions could impact both selling prices and purchasing costs and  consequently  favorably or unfavorably impact results of operations 
the company has a significant amount of outstanding dm denominated indebtedness which  at the company s option  may be repaid in euros 
in the company assessed and evaluated the impact of the euro conversion on its business and made the necessary system conversions 
the company spent and charged to expense less than million in evaluation and conversion costs 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the ultimate effect of the euro conversion  the company cannot accurately predict the impact on its results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company in the past has sought  and in the future may seek  to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  issue additional securities  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  the company may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the chemicals industry 
in the event of any acquisition or joint venture transaction  the company may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing its indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing the company s existing debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general the company is exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
otherwise  the company has not generally entered into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor has the company entered into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading purposes 
the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contracts related to currency exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  the company s aggregate indebtedness was split between of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates  by contractual maturity dates  for the company s aggregate indebtedness 
at december  all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars  and all outstanding variable rate indebtedness was denominated in deutsche marks 
information shown below for such dm denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using that date s exchange rate of dm per us dollar 
contractual maturity date fair value december  total in millions fixed rate debt us dollar denominated principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt dm denominated principal amount 

weighted average interest rate currency exchange rates the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the deutsche mark  canadian dollar  belgian franc  french franc  norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the conversion of certain of these currencies to the euro 
as described above  at december   the company had million of indebtedness denominated in deutsche marks 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates would be approximately million 
marketable equity security prices the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which are owned 
the fair value of such equity securities at december  was million 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million 
other the company believes there are certain shortcomings in the sensitivity analyses presented above  which analyses are required under the securities and exchange commission s regulations 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events or losses
