in view of the favorable trends in loss costs and frequency in and  the company lowered overall rate levels approximately and in and  respectively  and by an additional in february through its aggressive marketing efforts and the introduction of rating plans that offer lower rates to its more profitable  preferred customers and higher rates for drivers deemed to be greater risks  the company has been able to enhance its profitable customer mix 
the company s average customer retention rate was approximately for both and homeowners 
the company s position in the homeowners market has always been intended to complement its auto business and facilitate growth in that line 
units in force for the company s homeowners program declined by from december  to december   mainly due to attrition resulting from the prohibition by the california department of insurance against the company s writing any new homeowners policies 
although the company continues to seek approval to resume writing new business  it is unable to predict if or when the california insurance commissioner will grant the company s request which  in turn  has a negative impact on customer retention

the majority of the company s insured autos are located in southern california 
however  the company continues to expand its coverage throughout the state by aggressively marketing its business in northern california and san diego county  which accounted for approximately of all new business written in the auto line experienced a million underwriting profit in compared to million and million in and  respectively  as adjusted for the effects of nonrecurring costs 
these results were achieved despite increased competition and the effects of premium rate reductions of and effective october   and january   respectively 
favorable loss trends contributed to the solid underwriting results in all three years 
however  underwriting results for fell below the level primarily due to an increase in claims frequency that emerged principally in the fourth quarter and the rate decreases mentioned previously 
the decrease in gross premiums written reflects the increase in insured units coupled with the effect of the premium rate reductions mentioned above 
the decrease in gross premiums written reflects the increase in insured units offset by the effect of the premium rate reduction implemented in and the impact of rate reductions which were fully felt in including a first quarter rate reduction of  the company has reduced average california auto premiums by more than since although the reduction in premium revenues produced lower top line and investment income growth  underwriting margins continue to be favorable 
while a growth in business generally indicates the need for an increase in incurred but not reported ibnr reserves  favorable development in older case reserves and the lower frequency and severity of new claims have resulted in the company making a smaller provision for ibnr reserves than in the past  favorably impacting underwriting results 
homeowners excluding earthquake underwriting results for this program are subject to variability caused by weather related claims and by infrequent disasters 
in  and  no significant losses were incurred 
since july   the company has maintained reinsurance programs to provide coverage for its remaining homeowners policies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company had previously maintained separate catastrophe coverage which expired in june written premiums ceded in totaled million compared to million in and million in excluding the million portfolio transfer of unearned premium liabilities under the quota share reinsurance agreement 
personal umbrella policy the personal umbrella program has remained stable over the three year period ended december   producing approximately million in gross written premiums each year 
underwriting profits for this business can vary significantly with the number of claims which occur infrequently 
earthquake although the company did not write new or renewal earthquake premiums in through  the company assumes a small amount of earthquake premium from the california fair plan  a state administered pool of difficult to insure risks in which insurers are required to participate in proportion to their share of direct written homeowners coverage in the state 
as indicated previously  the company recorded additional provisions for the northridge earthquake in  and of million  million and million  respectively 
the company remains exposed to possible further upward development in the estimated cost to resolve certain northridge earthquake claims 
although management believes current reserves are adequate  the outcome of future events could require changes in previous estimates 
policy acquisition and general operating expenses the company s policy acquisition and general operating expense ratio continues to be among the most competitive in the industry 
as a direct writer  the company does not incur agent commissions and  thus  enjoys an expense advantage over most of its competitors 
the ratio of underwriting expenses excluding interest and fees to earned premiums was in  in and in excluding non recurring charges accelerated amortization of restricted stock grants of million in and year yk costs of million and million in and  respectively  the expense ratios remained relatively flat at in and and in despite a decline in premiums earned and an increase in marketing expenses 
impact of year the yk problem arose because some computer programs and hardware utilize two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  these systems  programs and hardware information technology systems or it systems may not calculate dates beyond  which may cause errors or system failures 
in addition  today s business environment contains many non it systems  ranging from elevators to automobiles  which utilize microprocessors  and these devices are also potentially susceptible to the same or similar types of date problems 
the following discussion summarizes the company s state of readiness  costs to address its yk issues  the risks inherent in these issues  and the company s contingency plans 
state of readiness the company has taken what it believes is a comprehensive approach to remediating its yk issues  as summarized in the following table milestone completion year critical mainframe applications high level risk assessment upgrade of base information systems to be year compliant complete integration testing of mainframe applications replacement of systems with packaged software warranted to be yk compliant other it hardware mainframe  client server  network  telecommunications  etc 
assessment  installation or conversion  test  and implementation non it systems including it systems maintained by third parties eg  banks  vendors  etc 
inventory and assessment  identify alternate sources  if required  and implement alternative sources as needed the company plans to complete its compliance testing of all critical components in the summer of yk remediation costs the total year project cost is estimated to be approximately million  which is being expensed as incurred 
approximately one third of that amount represents the direct cost of personnel in the company s information services department who have been dedicated to this project  with most of the remainder representing external consultants 
costs incurred during were approximately million  compared to million for risks without regard to the company s remediation efforts  given the highly computerized nature of the company s operations  the yk problem would pose a serious risk to the company s ability to efficiently and effectively service its customers  or to conduct its affairs in a profitable manner 
because of the nature of its operations and the availability of alternate suppliers and service providers  the potential yk issues for the company in the non it area generally are less than for manufacturers or distributors of non financial products 
apart from written assurances the company has or expects to receive  the company can offer no assurances that the impact of the yk problem on certain services  such as those provided by third party electric utilities  will be insignificant or within the company s ability to correct in a fashion timely enough to avoid any potentially significant adverse impact 
although no remediation plan is capable of foreseeing every possible contingency that could have a potentially significant adverse effect  management is confident that the steps taken to address the company s yk issues will prevent or promptly detect and correct any serious instances of noncompliance that are reasonably within the company s ability to control 
contingency plans for all critical systems within the company s control  revised contingency plans that take account of the yk issue are scheduled to be tested and in place by june these contingency plans generally cover steps the company would take  such as use of back up computer facilities  in the event of a business interruption from a variety of causes  including the remote possibility of an interruption caused by one or more yk problems 
the company s contingency planning team is staffed by representatives from all key business departments 
contingency planning currently under development includes the following considerations defining a rapid response team including identification of resources and responsibilities at a departmental level  identifying manual procedures to be implemented until the automated process is recovered  if necessary  for critical suppliers or service providers not expected to be compliant  selecting feasible alternate suppliers  when alternate suppliers are infeasible  addressing any means the company can take to assist key suppliers in a timely manner  determining key mission critical contingency plans and testing when feasible before the year investment income net pre tax investment income was million in compared to million in and million in average invested assets increased in compared to decreases of and in and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to additional cash received from the exercise of aig s common stock warrants in the third quarter of as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decline in invested assets for and resulted from the decline in net earned premiums and the sale of investments to meet the payment requirements of both developing earthquake losses and reinsurance premiums 
the average annual pre tax yield on invested assets was in  in and in realized capital gains on the sales of investments increased to million for compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in realized gains is primarily due to the company s decision to begin switching its investment portfolio from taxable to nontaxable securities during in anticipation of fully utilizing its remaining net operating loss deduction in at december   million of the company s total investments at fair value was invested in tax exempt bonds with the balance representing of the portfolio invested in taxable securities compared to at december  as of december   the company had a pre tax unrealized gain on fixed maturity investments of million compared to million in and million in interest rates fell in and which increased the fair value of the bond portfolio for those years 
liquidity and capital resources loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirements of the company 
the company continually monitors loss payments to provide projections of future cash requirements 
additional cash requirements include servicing the bank debt and paying dividends as approved from time to time by the company s board of directors 
with the anticipated growth of its core auto business and continued settlement of remaining earthquake losses  the company expects that future cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund future expenditures 
the company has historically written its core business at an underwriting profit and thus each premium dollar generates a positive cash flow 
a significant part of the decline in and subsequent increase in cash flow from operations in and is due to the fall and rise  respectively  in the size of the net book of business during these periods 
in  approximately million of the million net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was related to the portfolio transfer of unearned premiums on homeowners business 
funds required by th century industries to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations are provided by the insurance subsidiaries 
information regarding the company s debt service obligation is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company is regulated by state law 
based on the operating results in and the favorable ratio of premiums to surplus  the company was able to resume normal dividends from the insurance subsidiaries in to service the parent s debt and dividend requirements 
based upon operating results and earned surplus as of december   the company believes it will not require regulatory approval in for any extraordinary dividends 
the company s remaining net operating loss carryforward is expected to be fully utilized during see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result  income tax payments will increase in and future years compared to the years through to the extent practicable  the company s investment portfolio is being switched from taxable to nontaxable securities in order to minimize future tax payments 
in  the company embarked on a major project to upgrade its technological infrastructure and to conform certain of its procedures to industry best practices 
although the ultimate cost of this project is not yet determinable  management believes cash flow from operations as well as expected improvements in operational efficiencies will be more than adequate to fund the project s implementation which is expected to be completed over the next several years 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners requires property and casualty insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk based capital rbc formula in their annual statements 
the rbc requirements are intended to assist regulators in identifying inadequately capitalized companies 
the rbc calculation is based on the type and mix of risks inherent in the company s business and includes components for underwriting  asset  interest rate and other risks 
to the extent that a subsidiary s surplus fell below prescribed levels  it would be the parent company s intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity 
the company s insurance subsidiaries exceeded their rbc statutory surplus standards by a considerable margin as of december  home office lease the company leases its home office building in woodland hills  california  which contains approximately  square feet of leasable office space 
the current lease expires in and may be renewed for two consecutive five year periods 
in addition  the company will expand its headquarters to nearly double the size of its current facility in late  the anticipated completion date of construction of the new th century plaza 
the company has signed a year lease expiring in november  which may be renewed for two consecutive five year periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
in addition to market risk  the company is exposed to other risks  including the credit risk related to its financial instruments and the underlying insurance risk related to its core business 
the first column in the following table shows the financial statement carrying values of the company s financial instruments 
the company s investment portfolio is carried at fair value  the fair value of the company s variable rate bank loan payable is presumed to equal its carrying value 
the second column shows the effect on current carrying values and estimated fair values assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates and a decline in equity prices 
the following sensitivity analysis summarizes only the exposure to market risk as of december  amounts in thousands estimated fair value at adjusted market rates prices carrying value as indicated below interest rate risk fixed maturities available for sale   bank loan payable   equity price risk marketable equity securities   adjusted interest rates assume a basis point increase in market rates at december  adjusted equity prices assume a percent decline in values at december  because the company historically has generated an underwriting profit  its cash flow from operations and short term cash position generally is more than sufficient to meet its obligations for claim payments  which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business tend to have an average duration of less than a year 
as a result  the company generally has the ability to hold its investments to maturity  and it has been unnecessary for the company to employ elaborate market risk management techniques involving complicated asset and liability duration matching or hedging strategies 
for all its financial assets and liabilities  the company seeks to maintain reasonable average durations  consistent with the maximization of income without sacrificing investment quality and providing for liquidity and diversifications
