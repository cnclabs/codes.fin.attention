although the results of these operating groups can be significantly affected by the strength of the general economy  the company believes that it has positioned itself well in segments that can be expanded both externally through acquisitions particularly in the electrical electronics and maintenance products areas  and internally through new products  operational improvements and increased market penetrations 
following is a discussion concerning other factors that affected the company s net income 
gross profit from continuing operations increased  as gross margins decreased to from in while selling  general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to the prior year 
the increase in gross profit and slight decrease in gross margin is attributable to assuming a full year of operations from woods  which essentially is a higher volume  lower margin business than the existing businesses of the company 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the increase in sales volumes during  offset partially by lower selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales in the maintenance products group 
interest expense decreased  from primarily as a result of reclassifying the operations of cegf usa  inc  including interest expense  into the line item equity in income loss of other operations to be disposed of in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest income decreased  during due to the company maintaining less average cash and cash equivalent balances during compared to other  net in was income of  versus income of  in the decrease was a result of the company receiving settlements from various insurance companies associated with environmental issues in the prior year 
income before provision for income taxes to  in from  in this decrease relates primarily to the gain on sale of union pacific stock recognized in  offset partially by increased operating income from both the electrical electronics and the maintenance products groups 
provision for income taxes was  or an effective tax rate of in  and  or an effective rate of in the effective tax rate in reflects the benefits obtained from the woods acquisition effective december equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates increased  in primarily due to bee gee holding company improving upon an unfavorable year in note that the income from this equity investment has been included within the line item equity in income of other operations to be disposed of on the consolidated statement of operations for see note to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources combined cash and cash equivalents decreased to  on december   from  on december   mostly due to the acquisition activity during the current year 
excluding current year acquisitions  cash flow from operations was substantial enough to cover liquidity and capital resource requirements with the exception of the debt financed acquisition of contico international  llc in january of  the company believes that cash flow from operating activities should be able to cover its liquidity and capital resource requirements 
current ratios were to and to at december  and  respectively 
working capital decreased to  on december   from  on december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the previously mentioned cash and cash equivalents decrease in  offset by the company s emphasis on better management of working capital 
katy has authorized and expects to commit approximately  for capital projects in  of which  will be expended by the company s ongoing operations  exclusive of acquisitions  if any  and expects to meet these capital expenditure requirements through the use of available cash and internally generated funds 
the company continues to search for appropriate acquisition candidates  and may obtain all or a portion of the financing for future acquisitions through its unsecured million credit agreement described below 
on december   the company amended and restated its revolving credit agreement agented by bank of america with lasalle national bank acting as the managing agent 
the amended and restated credit agreement is for an unsecured million revolving loan which replaced an unsecured million revolving loan facility

during  the repurchase activities were minimal due to restrictions resulting from acquisition activity 
as of december    common shares may still be purchased to complete the repurchase program 
management continuously reviews each of its businesses 
as a result of these ongoing reviews  management may determine to sell certain companies and may augment its remaining businesses with acquisitions 
when sales do occur  management anticipates that funds from these sales will be used for general corporate purposes or to fund acquisitions 
acquisitions may also be funded through cash balances  available lines of credit and future borrowings

environmental and other contingencies in december  banco del atlantico  a bank located in mexico  filed a lawsuit against woods industries  inc woods  a subsidiary of the company  and against certain past and then present officers and directors and former owners of woods  alleging that the defendants participated in a violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act involving allegedly fraudulently obtained loans from mexican banks  including the plaintiff  and money laundering of the proceeds of the illegal enterprise 
all of the foregoing is alleged to have occurred prior to the company s purchase of woods 
the plaintiff also alleges that it made loans to an entity controlled by certain officers and directors based upon fraudulent representations 
the plaintiff seeks to hold woods liable for its alleged damage under principles of respondeat superior and successor liability 
the plaintiff is claiming damages in excess of  and is requesting treble damages under the statutes 
the defendants have filed a motion  which has not been ruled on  to dismiss this action on jurisdictional grounds 
because the litigation is in preliminary stages  it is not possible at this time for the company to determine an outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure 
the company may have recourse against the former owner of woods and others for  among other things  violations of covenants  representations and warranties under the purchase agreement through which the company acquired woods  and under state  federal and common law 
in addition  the purchase price under the purchase agreement may be subject to adjustment as a result of the claims made by banco del atlantico 
the extent or limit of any such recourse cannot be predicted at this time 
katy also has a number of product liability and workers compensation claims pending against it and its subsidiaries 
many of these claims are proceeding through the litigation process and the final outcome will not be known until a settlement is reached with the claimant or the case is adjudicated 
it can take up to years from the date of the injury to reach a final outcome for such claims 
with respect to the product liability and workers compensation claims  katy has provided for its share of expected losses beyond the applicable insurance coverage  including those incurred but not reported  which are developed using actuarial techniques 
such accruals are developed using currently available claim information  and represent management s best estimates 
the ultimate cost of any individual claim can vary based upon  among other factors  the nature of the injury  the duration of the disability period  the length of the claim period  the jurisdiction of the claim and the nature of the final outcome 
the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency  state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund or equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
under the federal superfund statute  parties could be held jointly and severally liable  thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site 
based on its estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent  public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information concerning the scope of contamination  estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees and other factors  the company has recorded and accrued for indicated environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately  at december  the ultimate cost will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents management s best current estimate of the total cost to be incurred 
the company expects this amount to be substantially paid over the next one to four years 
the most significant environmental matters in which the company is currently involved are as follows in  the united states environmental protection agency usepa initiated a unilateral administrative order proceeding under section of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra against wj smith and katy 
the proceeding requires certain actions at the wj smith site and certain off site areas  as well as development and implementation of additional cleanup activities to mitigate off site releases 
in december  wj smith  katy and usepa agreed to resolve the proceeding through an administrative order on consent under section of rcra 
pursuant to the order  wj smith is currently implementing a cleanup to mitigate off site releases 
during  the company reached agreement with the oregon department of environmental quality odeq as to a cleanup plan for pcb contamination at the medford  oregon facility of the former standard transformer division of american gage 
the agreement required the company to pay  of the first  in clearing costs 
those funds were expended in the present occupant of the site  balteau standard  inc was responsible for the remaining  of the first  and the next  in cleanup costs above the  the parties are now sharing equally in cleanup costs 
katy believes the cleanup plan has been successful and has requested that the odeq inspect and approve the remediation work 
katy has received such approval with respect to a portion of the cleanup plan 
further monitoring of groundwater and testing and cleanup of adjacent property may be required before approval can be obtained with respect to the remainder of the plan 
pending such approval  the liability of katy and its subsidiary cannot be determined at this time 
pursuant to an agreement executed in connection with the sale of assets of jei liquidating  inc  a katy subsidiary  katy has agreed to defend and indemnify the buyer of such assets  allard industries  inc allard  in the case captioned united states v 
exxon  et al 
in us district court  us  consolidated nos 
c  c l  c lcas 
the case concerns the disposal of hazardous substances at a landfill site in londonderry  new hampshire  at which jei liquidating  inc allegedly disposed of hazardous substances from its manchester  new hampshire facility 
the case arises under the superfund law 
the parties to the litigation have reached a settlement in principle  the specific terms of which are being negotiated in a consent decree 
under the expected consent decree  allard katy will pay approximately  and perform no future work at the site  subject to limited re openers 
in exchange  allard and katy will receive a release and contribution protection 
honeywell inc  a former owner and operator of jei liquidating  inc 
s manchester  new hampshire facility  has agreed in principle to pay  of allard katy s settlement under the consent decree 
pending entry of the consent decree and receipt of a release  katy s liability cannot be determined at this time 
although management believes that these actions individually and in the aggregate are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  further costs could be significant and will be recorded as a charge to operations when such costs become probable and reasonably estimable 
year the year issue is a problem that has a potentially material adverse impact on the company as well as governments  businesses  and individuals throughout the world 
the year issue affects computer programs and microchips that cannot properly recognize the first two digits of a year  beginning after december  the problem has the potential to disrupt the operation of products and services that rely on these computer programs or microchips 
based on assessment activities conducted by the company beginning in regarding the year problem  katy determined that the company required modification or replacement of a moderate number of computer programs and microchips 
the changes required are necessary for a wide variety of assets which include  but are not limited to  computer hardware and software  production machinery and phone systems 
the company believes that it has identified the major sources of potential internal year issues and implemented a company wide year remediation program the yk program during which includes the performance of due diligence procedures for all acquisitions made by the company 
the company has significantly completed the yk program as of december  and expects to fully complete the yk program by july   however  testing of new systems will continue throughout the year 
the company believes that completion of the yk program will substantially mitigate all known significant potential internal year problems by july  the company will continue to investigate additional year risks as they come to the attention of the company 
the company has contacted many of its critical suppliers  financial institutions  public utilities and other entities to determine the year readiness of its material business relationships 
while the company has not been informed of any material risks associated with these entities  there is no guarantee of the year readiness of those entities or the potential material adverse effect on the company 
the company has expensed approximately  of costs incurred to date related to the yk program 
approximately  has been expensed for fiscal year the total remaining costs of remediation are estimated to be  the costs of the yk program to date and estimated future costs  as well as yk program completion dates are based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers  customers and others  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
however  the yk program is expected to significantly reduce katy s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
other katy s operating plan of the continuing segments indicates an improvement in results compared to those reported in the plan reflects slightly lower results in the first quarter of from continuing segments compared to the year earlier periods due mainly to acquisition accounting of inventory purchased at contico international  llc  as well as the loss of business at woods industries  inc  previously announced on november  the plan for the second  third and fourth quarters of exceed the year earlier periods and projects an improved year to year result 
some of the statements in this form k  as well as statements by the company in periodic press releases  oral statements made by the company s officials to analysts and stockholders in the course of presentations about the company and conference calls following earning releases  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements
