year issues hypercom began a comprehensive project in to prepare its internal computer systems for the year hypercom believes it s implementation of a new enterprise wide information management system  principally installed to improve operating efficiency  will address hypercom s internal year compliance issues  and therefore does not believe the year will have a significant impact on operations 
hypercom has also reviewed other systems within the company  from desktop applications to the software utilized within hypercom s telecommunications system  and has concluded that only a few applications are not capable of making the transition from to the costs associated with such upgrades are minimal  and will be substantially offset through savings generated through increased productivity and enhanced functionality 
at this time  hypercom does not believe it is necessary to adopt a contingency plan covering the possibility that the remaining year upgrades will not be completed on a timely manner  but will continue to assess the need for such a plan 
hypercom develops and distributes computer hardware and software  and has thoroughly reviewed such systems for year compliance 
because of the interaction between hypercom s hardware software with other manufacturer s hardware software  hypercom refrains from warranting year compliance 
in order to make hypercom s pos terminal customers aware of potential issues with the transition from to  hypercom has  at its own expense  provided over ten thousand test cards to enable hypercom s customers to fully test the ability of hypercom s products  when interacting with other vendors software hardware  to ascertain whether or not a year compliance issue is present 
hypercom s ien nac products do not utilize an internal clock  and there are no year compliance issues with such products 
workstation software products may have a year compliance issue because of the operating system and database program utilized by hypercom s customers  not related to the applications developed and distributed by hypercom 
nevertheless  the company disclaims financial liability regarding year compliance and believes it is the customer s ultimate responsibility to verify whether or not there is a year compliance issue  and the company expressly disclaims any warranty or representation made in the foregoing regarding the company s products  and provides this information in compliance with published guidance of the securities and exchange commission 
hypercom faces risk to the extent that suppliers of products and services purchased by the company and others with whom hypercom transacts business on a worldwide basis do not have business products and services that comply with the year requirements 
the company is in the process of obtaining assurances from most of its key suppliers that their products and services are year compliant 
in the event any such third party cannot in a timely manner  provide hypercom with products and services that meet the year requirements  the company s could be materially adversely affected 
backlog as of june   the company had a backlog of million 
backlog was million at june  the company has taken steps to reduce terminal manufacturing lead time which reduces the customers required lead time 
these shorter lead times eliminate the prior requirements for customers to book orders covering longer periods 
the company includes in its backlog all revenue specified in signed contracts and purchase orders to the extent that the company contemplates recognition of the related revenue within one year 
there can be no assurance that the contracts included in backlog will actually generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the one year period 
special note concerning forward looking statements this annual report on form k  including the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements 
additional written or oral forward looking statements may be made by the company from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission  in its press releases  or otherwise 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intends  forecast  project  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
such statements may include  but not be limited to  the anticipated outcome of contingent events  including litigation  projections of revenues  income or loss  capital expenditures  plans for future operations  growth and acquisitions  financing needs or plans and the availability of financing  and plans relating to services of the company  as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing 
such forward looking statements are within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance and speak only as of the date the statements are made 
such forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking statements 
statements in this annual report  including the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  describe factors  among others  that could contribute to or cause such differences 
additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements are set forth in exhibit which is attached hereto and incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k 
in addition  new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors  nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or review any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
nevertheless  the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of the company s investment portfolio 
a substantial portion of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  the company does at times enter into these transactions in other currencies  such as the hong kong dollar  australian dollar  brazilian real and other asian and european currencies 
although no hedging transactions were entered into during the fiscal year ended june   the company has since established revenue and balance sheet hedging programs to protect against reductions in value and cash flow volatility caused by changes in foreign exchange rates 
such programs are intended to reduce market risks  but do not always eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange volatility 
the company does not purchase or hold any such derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation or arbitrage
