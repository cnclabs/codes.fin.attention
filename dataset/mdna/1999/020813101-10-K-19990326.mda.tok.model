such transactions include in march the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes due in in may the company s international pharmaceuticals division ipd purchased the cox generic pharmaceutical business cox conducted primarily in the united kingdom for approximately million 
in november the company s ipd purchased a generic pharmaceutical product line in germany for million 
in november the company acquired pursuant to a tender offer approximately of the outstanding warrants which were to have expired on january  with common stock with a market value of approximately million 
subsequent to december  the majority of the remaining warrants were exercised for million in cash 
in december the company s fine chemicals division fcd purchased a fine chemical manufacturing plant in budapest  hungary for million 
during the year the company commenced negotiations completed in january to replace its revolving credit facility and existing domestic short term credit lines with a comprehensive syndicated facility which provides for increased borrowing capacity of up to million 
the company raised million by issuing class b stock through a stock subscription million and class a stock through a rights offering million 
the animal health division ahd acquired the worldwide decoquinate deccoxr product and business from a major pharmaceutical company 
the product is an anticocidial feed additive which provides ahd with its first major product in the cattle industry 
the fcd purchased a worldwide polymyxin business which complements its existing polymyxin business 
both the us pharmaceuticals division uspd and the ipd completed partnership alliances and marketing agreements to broaden their product lines 
results in included charges for management actions 
in addition  operations were negatively affected by external market conditions 
the factors which combined to produce a loss in and the status of these factors in are as follows charges for management actions approximately million after tax 
rationalization of the ipd s selling and marketing organization in scandinavia resulting in charges for severance 
rationalization completed in commencement of an ipd plan to transfer all tablet  ointment and liquid production from copenhagen  denmark to lier  norway resulting in charges for severance  asset write offs and other exit costs 
transfer completed in late commencement of a uspd plan to accelerate the move of production from locations in new jersey and new york to an existing plant in lincolnton  north carolina resulting in charges for severance  asset write offs and other exit costs 
completed in  benefits realized in and due to more efficient production in the uspd 
rationalization of the ahd and uspd organizations to address current competitive conditions in their respective industries resulting in charges for severance and other termination benefits 
rationalization completed in external factors 
fundamental shift in generic pharmaceutical industry distribution  purchasing and stocking patterns resulting in significantly lower sales and prices in the uspd 
uspd sales have increased in both and in a more orderly market  however  there is continuing but significantly lessened pressure on pricing relative to significant bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy of a major wholesaler to the uspd and collection difficulties in certain international markets 
no major bankruptcies occurred in and  but collection of certain accounts remains slow in certain international markets 
high feed grain prices in the animal health industry which resulted in lower industry usage of feed additive products supplied by ahd and increased competition among feed additive suppliers 
grain prices were at more normal levels in and competitive conditions continue

acquisition of cox all comparisons of results to are affected by cox which was acquired in may of for a total purchase price including direct costs of acquisition of approximately million 
cox is a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer of tablets  capsules  suppositories  liquids  ointments and creams 
cox s main operations which primarily consist of a manufacturing plant  warehousing facilities and a sales organization are located in the united kingdom with distribution and sales operations located in scandinavia and the netherlands 
cox distributes its products to pharmacy retailers and pharmaceutical wholesalers primarily in the united kingdom 
exports account for approximately of its sales 
the company financed the million purchase price and related debt repayments from borrowings under its then existing long term revolving credit facility and short term lines of credit 
the million revolving credit facility rcf was used to fund the principal portion of the purchase price 
at the end of march  the company repaid approximately million of borrowings under the rcf with the proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes 
such repayment created the capacity under the rcf to incur the borrowings used to finance the acquisition of cox 
the acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the purchase method 
the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations are included from the date of acquisition 
the purchase of cox had a significant effect on the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  cox is included in ipd 
for the approximate eight month period included in  cox contributed sales of million and operating income  exclusive of non recurring acquisition related charges  of million 
operating income is reduced by the amortization of goodwill totaling approximately million

gross profit on a consolidated basis gross profit increased million with margins at in compared to in included in results is the non recurring charge of million related to the write up and subsequent sale of acquired cox inventory 
without the charge overall gross profit percentages would be essentially the same for both years 
gross profit dollars were positively affected by volume increases for existing and new products in all divisions and the acquisition of cox offset by increased costs incurred by ipd in the transfer of production from copenhagen to lier and currency translation effects primarily in ipd 
on an overall basis pricing had a minor positive effect

see section management actions 
revenues on an overall basis revenues increased million 
revenues compared to were reduced by over million due to translation of sales in foreign currency into the us dollar 
revenue changes by division are as follows revenues increased by million in the uspd due primarily to increased volume in a number of rx and otc products including products introduced in the past three years 
the increased volume was partially offset by lower net selling prices resulting from the continuation of programs initiated by major wholesalers in the second half of which fundamentally shifted generic pharmaceutical industry distribution purchasing and stocking patterns 
in ipd overall volume and pricing were up on a local currency basis 
however  ipd revenues were lower by million primarily as a result of the effect of translation of sales in scandinavian currencies into the us dollar 
a substantial majority of the translation effect was recognized in the ipd 
for the year average exchange rates for scandinavian currencies where ipd conducts a substantial portion of its business had declined by compared to sales in the fcd increased by million principally due to higher volume 
ahd revenues increased million primarily due to increased volume of most major products  as well as the acquisition of the deccox business in september aahd revenues increased million compared to due primarily to increased sales in the norwegian fish vaccine market resulting from both new product volume and increased market share of existing products 
gross profit on a consolidated basis  gross profit increased million and the gross margin percent increased to in compared to in the increase in dollars and percent was the result of a number of factors 
uspd gross profits accounted for the majority of the increase and improved as a result of lower manufacturing costs in the aggregate due to the transfer of production and closing of two marginal facilities as part of management actions in and increased production efficiencies in the two remaining core facilities 
offsetting savings in production costs were lower net selling prices in the upsd 
ipd had increased gross profits in local currencies but decreased in the aggregate when translated into us dollars 
fcd gross profits increased marginally compared to ahd gross profits increased due to increased volume both existing products and deccox offset partially by somewhat lower pricing 
aahd gross profits increased due to higher margin products introduced in operating expenses operating expenses on a consolidated basis decreased million or 
included in operating expenses in were charges incurred for management actions totaling million 
see section management actions 
the following table compares operating expenses for the year with and without management actions in millions operating expenses as reported management actions as a of revenues the net reduction in operating expenses  after excluding management actions reflects a continued emphasis on cost control  the effect of currency translation on expenses incurred in foreign currencies  and a reduction of expenses resulting from prior year management actions which reduced payroll  offset by planned increases in certain expenses and increases in administrative expenses resulting from personnel changes  employee incentive programs  and litigation expenses 
operating income operating income as reported in increased million 
the increase in gross profit due to increased sales and lower production costs  lower operating expenses  and the absence of charges for management actions all contributed to the increase

management actions in december  after the acquisition of alpharma oslo from al industrier  and continuing to some degree in the company announced a number of management actions which included staff reductions and certain product line and facilities rationalizations as a first step toward realizing combination synergies and maximizing the overall position of the newly combined company 
in the first quarter of  the company announced the reorganization of the ipd sales and marketing organization in scandinavia 
the reorganization resulted in severing personnel at a cost of million 
ipd estimates the annual expense reduction by from this action at over million 
in the second quarter of  the board of directors approved an ipd production rationalization plan which included the transfer of all tablet  ointment and liquid production from copenhagen  denmark to lier  norway 
the full transfer was completed in late and resulted in a net reduction of approximately employees 
the rationalization plan resulted in a charge in the second quarter of for severance for copenhagen employees  an impairment write off for certain buildings and machinery and equipment and other exit costs 
in  the company announced a plan by uspd to move all suppositories and cream and ointment production from two locations to the lincolnton  north carolina location 
in the second quarter of  uspd prepared a plan to accelerate the previously approved plan for consolidation of the manufacturing operations within uspd 
the board of directors approved the acceleration in may the acceleration plan included the discontinuing of all activities in two uspd manufacturing facilities in new york and new jersey and the transfer of all pharmaceutical production from those sites to the facility in lincolnton  north carolina 
the plan provided for complete exit by early and resulted in a net reduction of over employees 
the acceleration plan resulted in a second quarter charge in for severance of employees  a write off for leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment and significant exit costs including estimated remaining lease costs and facility refurbishment costs 
in the third quarter of  the company sold its tablet business which was located in new jersey and sub leased the new jersey location 
the sale provided net proceeds of approximately million and resulted in the adjustment of certain accruals for exit costs made in the second quarter which contemplated the shut down of the facility 
in the second half of  additional management actions included a reorganization at uspd which resulted in severing employees and a reorganization of the ahd business practices and staffing levels which resulted in severing and or early retirement of employees and other exit costs 
as a result of the reorganizations in uspd and ahd the company believes annual payroll and payroll related costs of million were eliminated 
the production rationalization plans have benefited operations in and for uspd and are expected to begin to benefit operations in ipd in the company believes the dynamic nature of its business may present additional opportunities to rationalize personnel functions and operations to increase efficiency and profitability 
accordingly  similar management actions may be considered in the future and could be material to the results of operations in the quarter they are announced 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company s operations during  and was not significant 
liquidity and capital resources at december   stockholders equity was million compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to equity was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in stockholders equity in primarily reflects net income in less dividends and the issuance of common stock in through the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
the increase in long term debt from to was due primarily to the acquisition of cox in may working capital at december  was million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the current ratio was at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the cox acquisition substantially increased the following balance sheet captions accounts receivable million  inventory million  property  plant and equipment million  intangible assets million  and accounts payable and accrued expenses million 
additionally at year end accounts receivable increased by over million due to significantly higher fourth quarter sales relative to the company presently has various capital expenditure programs under way and planned including the expansion of the newly acquired fcd facility in budapest  hungary 
in  the company s capital expenditures were million  and in the company plans to spend a greater amount than in in february  the company s uspd entered into an agreement with ascent pediatrics  inc ascent under which upsd will provide up to million in loans to ascent to be evidenced by convertible subordinated notes due up to million of the proceeds of the loans can be used for general corporate purposes  with million of proceeds reserved for projects and acquisitions intended to enhance growth of ascent 
while exact timing cannot be predicted  it is expected the million will be advanced in the next two years 
at december   the company had million available under existing short term unused lines of credit and million in cash 
in january  the company replaced its prior million revolving credit facility and domestic short term lines of credit with a million credit facility credit facility 
in addition  european short term credit lines were set at million 
the credit facility provides for a million six year term loan and a million revolving credit facility with an initial five year term with two possible one year extensions 
the credit facility extends the maturities under prior agreements and allows the company additional financing flexibility 
comparing year end debt amounts for the prior revolving credit  domestic short term debt and the a s eksportfinans loan all of which were refinanced in the first quarter  to the credit facility the company has approximately million available 
comparing the european line of credit to the year end short term debt balance  the company has over million available 
the company believes that the combination of cash from operations and funds available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to cover its currently planned operating needs 
a substantial portion of the company s short term and long term debt is at variable interest rates 
during  the company will consider entering into interest rate agreements to fix interest rates for all or a portion of its variable debt to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates 
the company s policy is to selectively enter into plain vanilla agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent 
in addition to investments for internal growth  the company has continued its pursuit of complementary acquisitions or alliances  particularly in human pharmaceuticals  that can provide new products and market opportunities as well as leverage existing assets 
in order to accomplish any significant acquisition  it is likely that the company will need to obtain additional financing in the form of equity related securities and or borrowings 
any significant new borrowings require the company meet the debt covenants included in the credit facility which provide for varying interest rates based on the ratio of total debt to ebitda 
year general the year yk issue is primarily the result of certain computer programs and embedded computer chips being unable to distinguish between the year and as a result  the company along with all other business and governmental entities  is at risk for possible miscalculations of a financial nature and systems failures which may cause disruptions in its operations 
the company can be affected by the yk readiness of its systems or the systems of the many other entities with which it interfaces  directly or indirectly 
the company began its program to address its potential yk issues in late and has organized its activities to prepare for yk at the division level 
the divisions have focused their efforts on three areas information systems software and hardware  manufacturing facilities and related equipment  ie embedded technology and third party relationships ie customers  suppliers  and other 
information system and hardware yk efforts are being coordinated by an it steering committee composed of divisional personnel 
the company and the divisions have organized their activities and are monitoring their progress in each area by the following four phases phase awareness assessment identify  quantify and prioritize business and financial risks by area 
phase budget plan timetable prepare a plan including costs and target dates to address phase exposures 
phase implementation execute the plan prepared in phase phase testing validation test and validate the implemented plans to insure the yk exposure has been eliminated or mitigated 
state of readiness the company summarizes its divisions state of readiness at december  as follows information systems and hardware quarter forecasted approximate range for substantial phase of completion completion completed st quarter nd quarter rd quarter embedded factory systems quarter forecasted approximate range for substantial phase of completion completion st quarter st quarter rd quarter rd quarter third party relationships quarter forecasted approximate range for substantial phase of completion completion a nd quarter a a nd quarter a a b a b a b a b a refers to significant identified risks eg customers  suppliers of raw materials and providers of services does not include exposures that relate to interruption of utility or government provided services 
b awaiting completion of vendor response and follow up due diligence to yk readiness surveys 
cost the company expects the costs directly associated with its yk efforts to be between and million of which approximately has been spent to date 
the cost estimates do not include additional costs that may be incurred as a result of the failure of third parties to become yk compliant or costs to implement any contingency plans 
risks the company has identified the following significant reasonably possible yk problems and is considering related contingency plans 
possible problem the inability of significant sole source suppliers of raw materials or active ingredients to provide an uninterrupted supply of material necessary for the manufacture of company products 
since various drug regulations will make the establishment of alternative supply sources difficult  the company is considering building inventory levels of critical materials prior to december  possible problem the failure to properly interface caused by noncompliance of significant customer operated electronic ordering systems 
the company is considering plans to manually process orders until these systems become compliant 
possible problem the shutdown or malfunctioning of company manufacturing equipment 
the company will advance internal clocks to the year on certain key equipment during scheduled plant shutdowns in to determine the effect on operations and develop plans  as necessary  for manual operations or third party contract manufacturing 
based on the assessment efforts to date  the company does not believe that the yk issue will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operation 
the company believes that any effect of the year issue will be mitigated because of the company s divisional operating structure which is diverse both geographically and with respect to customer and supplier relationships 
therefore  the adverse effect of most individual failures should be isolated to an individual product  customer or company facility 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties on which the company relies will be converted in a timely manner  or that a failure to properly convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s yk program is an ongoing process that may uncover additional exposures and all estimates of costs and completion are subject to change as the process continues 
derivative financial instruments market risk and risk management policies the company s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s risk management practice includes the selective use  on a limited basis  of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate agreements 
such instruments are used for purposes other than trading 
foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in us dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies 
the company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations 
the company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary s functional currency 
such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment 
at december  the company had forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of  the fair market value of such contracts is essentially the same as the notional amount 
all contracts expire in the first quarter of the cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non functional currency transactions 
the change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable 
at december  the company has no interest rate agreements outstanding 
the company is considering entering into interest rate agreements in to fix the interest rate on a portion of its long term debt 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  january  for the company 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
risk factors this report includes certain forward looking statements 
like any company subject to a competitive business environment  the company cannot guarantee the results predicted in any of the company s forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following government regulation the research  development  manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive government regulation 
government regulation includes inspection of and controls over testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  record keeping  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
the us and other governments regularly review manufacturing operations 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in fines  recall or seizure of products  suspension of production and debarment of individuals or the company from obtaining new drug approvals 
such government regulation substantially increases the cost of manufacturing and selling the company s products 
the company has filed applications to market its products with regulatory agencies both in the us and internationally 
the timing of receipt of approvals of these applications can significantly affect future revenues and income  particularly with respect to human pharmaceuticals at the end of third parties patent protection 
there can be no assurance that new product approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if ever 
failure to obtain approvals  or timing of approvals when expected  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the use of bacitracin zinc  a feed antibiotic growth promoter  is being banned for use in livestock feeds in the european union  effective st july  the company is attempting to reverse or limit this action  that affects its albac product  by political and legal means 
although no assurance of success can be given  it is the company s belief that strong scientific evidence exists to refute the eu action 
in addition  certain other countries have enacted or are considering a similar ban 
if the loss of albac sales is limited to the european union and those countries that have already taken similar action  the company does not anticipate a material adverse effect 
if either a other countries more important to the company s sales of bacitracin based products should ban the product or b the european union should act to prevent the importation of meat products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin based products  such actions could depending on their scope  be materially adverse to the company 
the company cannot predict whether the present bacitracin zinc ban will be expanded 
risks associated with leverage as of december   the company had total outstanding long term indebtedness of approximately million  or approximately of the company s total capitalization 
after refinancing of its long term debt in january the company may incur approximately million additional indebtedness through borrowings under its credit agreements  subject to the satisfaction of certain financial conditions 
the company s leverage could have important consequences  including the following i the ability to obtain additional financing may be limited  ii the operating flexibility is limited by covenants contained in the credit agreements  and iii the degree of leverage makes it more vulnerable to economic downturns  may limit its ability to pursue other business opportunities and reduces its flexibility 
in addition  the company believes that it has greater leverage on its balance sheet than many of its competitors 
risks associated with acquisitions the company maintains its search for acquisitions which will provide new product and market opportunities  leverage existing assets and add critical mass 
the company is actively evaluating various acquisition possibilities 
based on current acquisition prices in the pharmaceutical industry  acquisitions could initially be dilutive to the company s earnings and add significant intangible assets and related goodwill amortization charges 
the company s acquisition strategy will require additional debt or equity financing  resulting in additional leverage and dilution of ownership  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company s acquisition strategy will be successful 
foreign operations  risk of currency fluctuation the company s foreign operations are subject to various risks which are not present in domestic operations  including  in certain countries  currency exchange fluctuations and restrictions  political instability  and uncertainty as to the enforceability of  and government control over  commercial rights 
the company s far east operations  particularly indonesia where the company has a manufacturing facility  are being affected by the wide currency fluctuations and decreased economic activity in the far east and by the social and political unrest in indonesia 
while the company s present exposure to economic factors in the far east is not material  the region is an important area for anticipated future growth 
products in many countries recognized to be susceptible to significant foreign currency risk are generally sold for us dollars which eliminates the direct currency risk but can create a risk of collectibility if the local currency devalues significantly 
fluctuating operating results the company has experienced in the past  and will experience in the future  variations in revenues and net income as a result of many factors  including acquisitions  delays in the introduction of new products  the level of expenses  management actions and the general conditions of the pharmaceutical and animal health industry 
competition all of the company s businesses operate in highly competitive markets and many of the company s competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
as a result  the company may be at a disadvantage in its ability to develop and market new products to meet competitive demands 
the us generic pharmaceutical industry has historically been characterized by intense competition 
as patents and other basis for market exclusivity expire  prices typically decline as generic competitors enter the marketplace 
normally  there is a further unit price decline as the number of generic competitors increase 
the timing of these price decreases is unpredictable and can result in a significantly curtailed period of profitability for a generic product 
in addition brand name manufacturers frequently take actions to prevent or discourage the use of generic equivalents through marketing and regulatory activities and litigation 
generic pharmaceutical market conditions in the us were further exacerbated in the second half of by a fundamental shift in industry distribution  purchasing and stocking patterns resulting from increased importance of sales to major wholesalers and a concurrent reduction in sales to private label generic distributors 
the company believes that this trend continues to date 
wholesaler programs generally require lower prices on products sold  lower inventory levels kept at the wholesaler and fewer manufacturers selected to provide products to the wholesaler s own marketing programs 
the factors which have adversely affected the us generic pharmaceutical industry may also affect some or all of the markets in which the international pharmaceutical division operates 
in addition  in europe the company is encountering price pressure from parallel imports ie  imports of identical products from lower priced markets under eu laws of free movement of goods and general governmental initiatives to reduce drug prices 
parallel imports could lead to lower volume growth 
both parallel imports and governmental cost containment could create downward pressure on prices in certain product and geographical market areas including the nordic countries where the company has significant sales 
the company has been and will continue to be affected by the competitive and changing nature of this industry 
accordingly  because of competition  the significance of relatively few major customers eg  large wholesalers and chain stores  a rapidly changing market and uncertainty of timing of new product approvals  the sales volume  prices and profits of the company s us and international pharmaceutical divisions and its generic competitors are subject to unforeseen fluctuation 
dependence on single sources of raw material supply and contract manufacturers raw materials and certain products are currently sourced from single domestic or foreign suppliers 
although the company has not experienced difficulty to date  there can be no assurance that supply interruptions will not occur in the future or that the company will not have to obtain substitute materials or products  which would require additional regulatory approvals 
further  there can be no assurance that third parties that supply the company will continue to do so 
any interruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company 
third party reimbursement pricing pressures the company s commercial success with respect to generic products will depend  in part  on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party health care payers  such as government and private health insurers and managed care organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement will be available to enable the company to maintain its present product price levels 
in addition  the market for the company s products may be limited by actions of third party payers 
for example  many managed health care organizations are now controlling the pharmaceutical products which will be approved for reimbursement 
the competition to place products on these approved lists has created a trend of downward pricing pressure in the industry 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be included on the approved lists of managed care organizations or that downward pricing pressures in the industry generally will not negatively impact the company s business 
potential liability for current products continuing studies of the proper utilization  safety  and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by the industry  government agencies and others 
such studies  which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products 
in some cases these studies have resulted in the removal of products from the market and have given rise to claims for damages from previous users 
the company s business could be materially adversely affected by the assertion of such product liability claims 
relationship of the company and al industrier  controlling stockholder  conflicts of interest al industrier  industrier as the beneficial owner of of the outstanding shares of the class b stock  is presently entitled to elect two thirds of the members of the company s board of directors and to cast more than of the votes generally entitled to be cast on matters presented to the company s stockholders 
secondly  industrier controls the company and its policies 
mr 
sissener  chairman and chief executive officer of the company  controls a majority of industrier s outstanding shares and thus may be deemed the indirect controlling stockholder of the company 
industrier s ownership of the class b stock has the effect of preventing hostile takeovers  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over current market prices 
industrier also beneficially owns a convertible note of the company in the principal amount of million  which may convert upon the occurrence of certain events after april  into  shares of class b stock 
in addition  mr 
sissener and his family hold  shares of class a common stock 
ew sissener  chairman and chief executive officer of the company  is also chairman of industrier and controls industrier 
gert munthe  president and chief operating officer of the company  is a director of industrier 
the company and industrier engage in various transactions from time to time  and conflicts of interest are present with respect to the terms of such transactions 
the company believes that contractual arrangements with industrier are no less favorable to the company than other third party contracts that are negotiated on an arm s length basis 
all contractual arrangements between the company and industrier are subject to approval by  or ratification of  the audit committee of the board of directors of the company consisting of directors who are unaffiliated with industrier
