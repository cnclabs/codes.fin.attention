year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company is currently engaged in a two phase process to evaluate its internal status with respect to the year issue 
in the first phase  which the company expects to complete in the second quarter of fiscal  the company is conducting an evaluation of its systems  including both information technology it systems and non it systems such as hardware and manufacturing equipment containing embedded technology  for year compliance 
the company has completed a significant portion of this phase to date  and systems that have been evaluated are either year compliant or are expected to be made compliant at an immaterial cost to the company 
although the company does not expect that the impact of the year issue will be material in systems still under evaluation  there can be no assurance that the company will not discover year issues in the course of its evaluation process that would have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
phase two of the process  which is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  will involve taking any needed corrective action to bring systems into compliance and to develop a contingency plan in the event any non compliant critical systems remain by january  as part of this phase  the company will attempt to quantify the impact  if any  of the failure to complete any necessary corrective action 
although the company cannot currently estimate the magnitude of such impact  if systems material to the company s operations have not been made year compliant upon completion of this phase  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  the costs incurred by the company with respect to this process have not been material 
future costs will remain difficult to estimate until the completion of phase one  however  the company does not currently anticipate that such costs will be material 
concurrently with the two phase analysis of its internal systems  the company has begun to survey third party entities with which the company transacts business  including critical vendors and financial institutions  for year compliance 
the company expects to complete this survey in the second quarter of fiscal at this time the company cannot estimate the effect  if any  that non compliant systems at these entities could have on the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company  and there can be no assurance that the impact  if any  will not be material

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
the company owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of its investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve the company s capital until it is required to fund operations  including the company s research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
the company does not own derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
due the nature of the company s investments portfolio  the investment portfolio contains instruments that are primarily subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments that are primarily united states government and agency bonds of durations ranging from one to four years 
the market value of these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates decrease 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in cash flow  the company maintains substantially all of its debt instruments as fixed rate 
the portion maintained as fixed rate is dependent on many factors including judgments as to future trends in interest rates 
the company s investment portfolio also includes equity interests in united states government and agency bond funds 
the value of these equity interests is also subject to interest rate risk 
the company regularly assesses the above described market risks and has established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
the company s investment policy restricts investments to us government or government backed securities  or the highest rated commercial paper ap only 
as a result  the company does not anticipate any material losses in these areas 
for disclosure purposes  the company uses sensitivity analysis to determine the impacts that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of the company s debt and financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis consist of all of the company s cash and cash equivalents and long term and short term debt instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  the company assesses the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on market sensitive instruments 
the fair values are computed based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
the discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest rates in effect at december  the fair values that result from these computations are compared with the fair values of these financial instruments at december  the differences in this comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
the results of the sensitivity analysis at december  are as follows interest rate sensitivity a decrease in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s financial instruments by  per year 
a increase in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the fair value of the company s financial instruments by  per year 
the company maintains a portion of its financial instruments  including long term debt instruments of million at december   at variable interest rates 
if interest rates were to increase  the impact of such instruments on cash flows or earnings would not be material 
the use of a estimate is strictly for estimation and evaluation purposes only 
the value of the company s assets may rise or fall by a greater amount depending on actual general market performances and the value of individual securities owned by the company 
the market price of the notes generally changes in parallel with the market price of the common stock 
when the common stock price increases  the price of the notes generally increases proportionally 
fair market price of the notes can be determined from quoted market prices  where available 
the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be  at december  and is lower than the carrying value by  market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rate and a decrease in quoted market prices  or
