liquidity and capital resources general the trust commenced operations on december  as of december   the trust had investments in thirty one facilities located in fourteen states 
it is the trust s intention to declare quarterly dividends to the holders of its shares of beneficial interest so as to comply with applicable sections of the internal revenue code governing real estate investment trusts 
convenants relating to the revolving credit facility limit the trust s ability to increase dividends in excess of of cash available for distribution unless additional distributions are required to be made to comply with applicable sections of the internal revenue code and related regulations governing real estate investment trusts 
during  dividends of per share  or  in the aggregate  were declared and paid 
net cash generated by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the million net increase in as compared to was due primarily to i a  increase in net income plus the addback of the non cash charges depreciation  amortization  and amortization of interest rate cap expense  ii a  favorable change in rent receivable  and  iii a  favorable change in tenant escrows  deposits and prepaid rents 
the  net decrease in as compared to was due primarily to a  decrease in net income plus the addback of the non cash charges as defined above and  of unfavorable changes in other net working capital accounts

these loans  which are earning interest at variable rates depending upon the length of time the loan is outstanding  earned interest at an annual average rate of for the loans are expected to be fully repaid to the trust during once the llcs secure long term  third party financing

during  the trust replaced its million revolving credit agreement with a new million unsecured  non amortizing revolving credit agreement the agreement  which is scheduled to expire in june  during the term of the agreement  the trust has the option to request an increase in the borrowing capacity to million 
the agreement provides for interest at the trust s option  at the certificate of deposit rate plus to  eurodollar rate plus to or the prime rate 
a fee of 
to 
is required on the unused portion of this commitment 
the margins over the certificate of deposit rate  eurodollar rate and the commitment fee are based upon the trust s debt to total capital ratio as defined by the agreement 
at december   the applicable margin over the certificate of deposit and eurodollar rates were and  respectively  and the commitment fee was 
there are no compensating balance requirements 
the agreement contains a provision whereby the commitments will be reduced by of the proceeds generated from any new equity offering 
at december   the trust had approximately million of available borrowing capacity 
covenants relating to the revolving credit facility require the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth and specified financial ratios  limit the trust s ability to incur additional debt  limit the aggregate amount of mortgage receivables and limit the trust s ability to increase dividends in excess of of cash available for distribution  unless additional distributions are required to comply with the applicable section of the internal revenue code and related regulations governing real estate investment trusts 
the trust has entered into interest rate swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement which are designed to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate revolving credit notes 
the trust has three outstanding swap agreements for notional principal amounts of million  million and  which mature in may   july  and may   respectively 
these swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on  of variable rate debt at including the revolver spread of 
the interest rate cap  for which the trust paid  unamortized premium of  at december  matures in june  and fixes the maximum rate on million of variable rate revolving credit notes at including the revolver spread of 
the interest rate swap and cap agreements were entered into in anticipation of certain borrowing transactions made by the trust during  and the effective rate on the trust s revolving credit notes including commitment fees and interest rate swap expense was  and during  and  respectively 
additional interest expense recorded as a result of the trust s hedging activity  which is included in the effective interest rates shown above  was   and  in  and  respectively 
the trust is exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap and cap agreements 
these counterparties are major financial institutions and the trust does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties which are rated a or better by moody s investors service 
termination of the interest rate swaps at december  would have resulted in payments to the counterparties of approximately  and termination of the interest rate cap would have had no impact on the trust 
the fair value of the interest rate swap and cap agreements at december  reflects the estimated amounts that the trust would pay or receive to terminate the contracts and are based on quotes from the counterparties 
results of operations total revenues increased or  to million in as compared to and or  to million in as compared to the  increase during over was due primarily to a  increase in base rentals from non related parties due primarily to the completion of the cypresswood professional center during the third quarter of  and a  increase in bonus rental income from uhs facilities 
these favorable changes were partially offset by a  decrease in interest income due to a mortgage loan receivable which was fully repaid in june  and a construction loan receivable which was repaid in december  the  increase during over was primarily attributable to an increase in base rentals from non related parties due to the various acquisitions made by the trust during the second quarter of and the third quarter of see note 
the average occupancy rate of a hospital is affected by a number of factors  including the number of physicians using the hospital  changes in the number of beds  the composition and size of the population of the community in which the hospital is located  general and local economic conditions  variations in local medical and surgical practices and the degree of outpatient use of the hospital services 
current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors 
a continuation of such industry trends could have a material adverse impact upon the future operating performance of the trust s hospital facilities 
the trust s hospital facilities have experienced growth in outpatient utilization over the past several years 
the increase in outpatient services is primarily the result of advances in medical technologies and pharmaceutical improvements  which allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  and increased pressure from medicare  medicaid  managed care companies and other insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
the hospital industry in the united states as well as the trust s hospital facilities continue to have significant unused capacity which has created substantial competition for patients 
inpatient utilization continues to be negatively affected by payor required  pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
the trust expects the increased competition  admission constraints and payor pressures to continue 
the ability of the trust s hospital facilities to maintain their historical rate of net revenue growth and operating margins is dependent upon their ability to successfully respond to these trends as well as reductions in spending on governmental healthcare programs 
a significant portion of the revenues generated at the trust s hospital facilities are derived from fixed payment services  including medicare and medicaid 
the medicare program reimburses the trust s hospital facilities primarily based on established rates by a diagnosis related group for acute care hospitals and by a cost based formula for behavioral health facilities 
historically  rates paid under medicare s prospective payment system pps for inpatient services have increased  however  these increases have been less than cost increases 
the balanced budget act calls for the government to trim the growth of federal spending on medicare by billion and on medicaid by billion over the next five years 
the act also calls for the reductions in the future rate of increases to payments made to hospitals and reduces the amount of reimbursement for outpatient services  bad debt expense and capital costs 
it is likely that future budgets will contain further reductions in the rate of increase of medicare and medicaid spending  as evidence by the clinton administration s proposed fiscal year budget which includes a proposal to freeze medicare hospital payment rates 
outpatient reimbursement for medicare patients is scheduled to convert to a pps during the second quarter of since final provisions of the outpatient medicare pps are not yet available  operators of the trust s hospitals can not completely estimate the resulting impact on their future results of operations 
while the trust is unable to predict whether this most recent proposal  or any other future health reform legislation  will ultimately be enacted at the federal or state level  the trust expects continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental healthcare programs 
further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit healthcare spending could have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the trust s facilities and the healthcare industry 
in general  the operators of the trust s hospital facilities expect to continue to experience an increase in business from managed care programs  including hmos and ppos 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of the trust s facilities vary among the markets in which the trust s facilities operate 
management of the trust is unable to predict the rate of growth of the net revenues of its facilities and the resulting impact on bonus revenues  which are computed as a percentage of each facility s net revenues in excess of base year amounts or cpi increases in excess of base year amounts 
net revenues of the trust s facilities are dependent upon developments in medical technologies and physician practice patterns  both of which are beyond the control of management of the facilities 
interest expense increased  or in as compared to and  or in as compared to due primarily to the additional borrowings used to finance the  and investments described in note depreciation and amortization expense increased  or in as compared to and  or in as compared to due primarily to the depreciation expense related to the and acquisitions described in note other operating expenses increased  or in as compared to due to the operating expenses on the cypresswood professional center on which construction was completed during the third quarter of and an increase in various other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the expenses related to the medical office buildings acquired by the trust during the second quarter of and the third quarter of and an increase in various other operating expenses 
the expenses related to the medical office buildings  in which the trust has a controlling ownership interest  totaled million in   in and  in the majority of these expenses are passed on directly to the tenants and are included as revenues in the trust s statements of income 
net income for was million or per basic and diluted share compared to million or per basic and diluted share in and million or per basic and diluted share in funds from operations ffo  which is the sum of net income plus depreciation expense for consolidated investments and unconsolidated investments and amortization of interest rate cap expense  totaled million in  million in and million in ffo may not be calculated in the same manner for all companies  and accordingly  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the trust s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
general during the third quarter of  wholly owned subsidiaries of uhs exercised five year renewal options on four hospitals owned by the trust which were scheduled to expire in through virtue street pavilion  the bridgeway  inland valley regional medical center and wellington regional medical center 
the leases on these facilities were renewed at the same lease rates and terms as the initial leases and these renewals remove the majority of the previously disclosed uncertainty regarding the lease renewals with subsidiaries of uhs 
as part of the renewal agreement  the trust also agreed to grant additional fixed rate renewal options to a wholly owned subsidiary of uhs commencing in on the real property of mcallen medical center 
management of the trust can not predict whether the leases with subsidiaries of uhs  which have renewal options at existing lease rates  or any of the trust s other leases  will be renewed at the end of their initial term or first five year renewal term 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs  certain building infrastructure components including elevators  alarm systems and certain hvac systems and certain computer aided medical equipment that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of operations or medical equipment malfunctions that could affect patient diagnosis and treatment 
management of the trust recognizes the need to evaluate the impact on its operations of the change to calendar year and does not expect the total cost of required building related modifications to have a material impact on its results of operations 
approximately of the trust s total revenues for the three year period ended december   were earned under the terms of the leases with wholly owned subsidiaries of uhs 
uhs has undertaken steps to inventory and assess applications and equipment at risk to be affected by year issues and to convert  remediate or replace such applications and equipment 
uhs has completed its assessment of its major financial and clinical software and believes that such software is substantially year compliant 
as to certain peripheral software  uhs has scheduled upgrades to be completed by june  for its biomedical equipment  uhs expects to complete the assessment phase of its year analysis by early in the second quarter of uhs believes that year related remediation costs incurred through december  have not had a material impact on its results of operations 
however  uhs is not able to reasonably estimate the total capital costs to be incurred for equipment replacement since the equipment analysis phase has not yet been completed 
some replacement or upgrade of systems and equipment would take place in the normal course of business 
several systems  key to uhs s operations  have been scheduled to be replaced through vendor supplied systems before year the costs of repairing existing systems is expensed as incurred 
uhs has allocated a portion of its capital budget as year contingency funds and expects that all of the capital costs can be accommodated within that budget 
uhs presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose material operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of uhs and uhs s ability to meet its obligations under the terms of its leases with the trust 
the majority of the software used by uhs is purchased from third parties 
uhs is relying on software including uhs s major outsourcing vendor which provides the financial and clinical applications for the majority of uhs s acute care facilities  hardware and other equipment vendors to verify year compliance of their products 
uhs also depends on fiscal intermediaries which process claims and make payments for the medicare program  health maintenance organizations  insurance companies and other private payors  vendors of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals used in patient care  and  providers of utilities such as electricity  water  natural gas and telephone services 
as part of its year strategy  uhs intends to seek assurances from these parties that their services and products will not be interrupted or malfunction due to the year problem 
failure of third parties to resolve their year issues could have a material adverse effect on uhs s results of operations and its ability to provide health care services 
each of uhs s hospitals has a disaster plan which will be reviewed as part of uhs s year contingency planning process 
however  no assurance can be given that uhs will be able to develop contingency plans which will enable each of its facilities to continue to operate in all circumstances 
this year assessment is based on information currently available to uhs and the trust and uhs and the trust will revise its assessment at it implements its year strategy 
uhs can provide no assurance that applications and equipment uhs believes to be year compliant will not experience difficulties or that uhs will not experience difficulties obtaining resources needed to make modifications to or replace its affected systems and equipment 
failure by uhs or third parties on which it relies to resolve year issues could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  its ability to provide health care services and on uhs s ability to meet its obligations under the terms of its leases with the trust 
consequently  the trust can give no assurances that issues related to year will not have a material adverse effect on it s financial condition or results of operations 
with respect to the trust s non related properties  an assessment was conducted by the trust which covered the compliance efforts of the tenants and based upon the responses received  these tenants do not expect year related issues to have a material impact on their operations 
management of the trust will continue to monitor the year compliance efforts of its non related tenants as well as the effects of potential non compliance 
the trust will develop contingency plans if  and to the extent  deemed necessary 
however  based upon current information and barring developments  the trust does not anticipate developing any substantive contingency plans with respect to year issues 
in addition  the trust has no plans to seek independent verification or review of its assessments 
the trust believes that its expenditures for assessing and correcting year issues have not been material 
in addition  the trust is not aware of any issues that will require material expenditures by the trust or tenants of the trust s facilities in the future 
based upon current information  the trust believes that the risk posed by the foreseeable year related problems with its internal systems  including both information and non information systems is minimal 
year related problems at certain third party payors  service providers and non related tenants is greater  however  based upon current information  the trust does not believe such problems will have a material effect on its operations 
while the trust believes that it will be year compliant by december   there can be no assurance that the trust or tenants of the trust s properties will be successful in identifying and assessing all compliance issues  or that the efforts of the trust or tenants of the trust properties to remedy all year compliance issues will be effective such that they will not have a material adverse effect on the trust s business or results of operations 
market risks associated with financial instruments the trust s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic interest rates  a portion of the trust s debt is fixed rate accomplished by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements are contracts that require the trust to pay a fixed and receive a floating interest rate over the life of the agreements 
the floating rates are based on libor and the fixed rates are determined upon consummation of the swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements do not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposures 
the trust does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
the trust is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to its financial instruments 
the counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions  rated a or better by moody s investor services and the trust anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
for the years ended december   and  the trust received a weighted average rate of  and  respectively  and paid a weighted average rate on its interest rate swap agreements of  and  respectively
