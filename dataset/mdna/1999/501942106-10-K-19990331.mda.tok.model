item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section  which relates only to the company s continuing operations  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
introduction the company s select growth finance  portfolio finance and vendor finance activities consist largely of direct finance leases and loans 
the company funds these leases and loans through its revolving credit and securitization facilities and other recourse and nonrecourse debt 
in its rental and distribution activities  the company rents  leases and sells new and used analytical instruments and related equipment and funds these activities primarily through its revolving credit facility 
the following briefly describes some of the principal accounting practices applicable to the company s business 
direct finance leases 
direct finance leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the lessee 
a lease is accounted for as a direct finance lease if the collectibility of lease payments is reasonably certain and it meets one of the following criteria i the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the lessee by the end of the lease term  ii the lease contains a bargain purchase option  iii the lease term at inception is at least of the estimated economic life of the leased equipment  or iv the present value of the minimum lease payments is at least of the fair value of the leased equipment at inception of the lease 
the present value of the future lease payments and the present value of the residual value are recorded as the initial investment in such leases 
this initial investment generally represents the cost of leased equipment 
unearned lease income is equal to the difference between i the future lease payments and residual value and ii their corresponding present values 
unearned lease income is amortized and recorded as revenue over the term of the lease by applying a constant periodic rate of return to the declining net investment 
initial direct costs incurred in originating leases  such as salaries for marketing personnel and commissions  are capitalized as part of the net investment and amortized over the lease term 
the company records direct finance leases as net investment in direct finance leases and loans 
at the end of the lease  a remarketing gain or loss is recorded to the extent the proceeds of sale or re leasing of the equipment exceed or are less than the originally estimated residual value 
when the company leases analytical instruments  such leases are accounted for similarly to direct finance leases except that the company records the sales value of the instruments as revenue and the carrying value as cost of equipment sold  thus recognizing its distribution margin sales type leases 
secured loans 
loans made by the company  which are secured by equipment or other assets of the borrowers  are recorded as net investment in direct finance leases and loans at the present value of the future note payments 
initial direct costs incurred in originating loans are capitalized as part of the net investment and amortized over the term 
income is recognized over the term of the note by applying a constant periodic rate of return to the declining note balance and is recorded as interest income 
rentals and operating leases 
all rental and lease contracts that do not meet the criteria of direct finance leases are accounted for as operating leases 
terms on rental contracts are shorter than twelve months  while terms on operating leases are longer 
rental and lease payments are recorded as rental and operating lease revenue 
related equipment is recorded at the company s cost as equipment held for rental and operating leases and depreciated on a straight line basis 
the company depreciates analytical instruments over a seven year life  assuming no salvage or residual value at the end of this life 
the company has realized gains from the sale of used analytical instruments each year since the inception of its rental and distribution activities 
other leased equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life to its salvage or residual value 
equity participation rights 
the company frequently receives warrants or other equity participation rights in connection with leases to select growth finance clients 
such warrants or rights entitle the company to purchase common stock or other equity securities of the client at a price generally based on the most recent price paid by the client s private equity investors 
the company typically obtains the right to have such shares included in registered public offerings of the client s stock 
at the time of receipt  the warrant or other equity participation right is recorded as an investment at cost 
the company does not recognize gain or loss on such securities until they are sold 
the company periodically reviews its portfolio of equity participation rights based on its evaluation of the market trends for the related clients equity securities 
the company expects to sell its equity participation rights as its portfolio companies mature 
realization of residual values 
residual values are estimated at the inception of a lease and reviewed periodically over the lease term 
estimated residual values of leased equipment may be subsequently reduced  but not increased 
reductions in estimated residual values are made as the need becomes apparent and are reflected by increased depreciation expense for operating leases or by decreased earned lease income for direct finance leases 
when equipment is sold  the net proceeds realized in excess of the estimated residual value are recorded as a gain on equipment residual values  or the amount by which the estimated residual value exceeds the net proceeds is recorded as a loss 
the company has not had a net loss from the realization of residual values for any quarterly period 
servicing fees 
the company realizes revenue for lease receivables serviced under the terms of its securitization facility 
additionally  the company engages in the business of servicing lease portfolios originated by third parties but has not entered into a new agreement to service leases for third parties since december revenues from these activities are classified as fee income 
securitizations of lease portfolios 
in a securitization transaction  the company sells a pool of leases to a wholly owned special purpose entity which then transfers or pledges the leases to the lender 
the company generally retains the right to receive any excess cash flows of the special purpose entity 
until october   the company recognized a gain on the sale of leases in securitizations equal to the excess of the net proceeds from the sale  after deducting issuance expenses  over the cost basis of the leases sold 
effective october   the company eliminated gain on sale treatment for securitized leases by modifying the structure of its securitization facility such that it is considered a non recourse debt instrument under generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  no gain on sale of lease receivables in securitization transactions was recorded during the fourth quarter of provision for credit losses 
each of the company s activities involves risk of credit loss 
management evaluates the collectibility of the company s leases and loans based on the creditworthiness of the related lessee or obligor  delinquency statistics  historical loss experience  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the company provides a reserve for credit losses at the time that the lease or loan commences and periodically evaluates the reserve based on current delinquency experience and the financial status of its lessees or obligors 
results of operations compared to net earnings from continuing operations net earnings for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted common share  compared to million  or per diluted common share for the year ended december  the increase in net earnings for compared to the prior year is primarily due to gains recognized during the first nine months of the year on the securitization of lease receivables  gains recognized on the sale of equity participation rights  and increased earnings contributions from the company s rental and distribution activities 
new lease originations grew from million in to million including leases funded in connection with acquisitions in interest expense increased as a result of an increase in borrowings to fund new lease originations

net margins on sales of analytical instruments declined from to primarily as a result of lower gross margins on sales type leases originated in the company s rental and distribution segment during the first half of direct finance lease income more than doubled from million to million as a result of a substantially higher level of finance lease receivables outstanding  coming from acquisitions and from internal lease originations average finance lease receivables outstanding increased 
interest income increased from million to million  primarily due to an increase in interest bearing notes receivable and equipment loans held by the company  as well as the income recognized on the company s securitization retained interest 
rental and operating lease revenue increased from million to million primarily due to acquisitions of portfolios of operating leases upon the company s re entry in the portfolio finance segment after the expiration of a non compete agreement in september fee income increased from million to million  due to increases in servicing fees relating to a third party lease portfolio serviced by the company and an increase in fees received in connection with servicing securitized leases 
this increase was partially offset by the decline in the number of leases serviced by the company for unrelated parties 
during and  the company securitized leases with a book value of million and million  respectively  net of bad debt reserves and customer holdbacks of million and million 
in connection with these securitizations  the company realized gains on the sale of lease receivables of million and million in and  respectively 
effective october   the company eliminated gain on sale treatment for securitized leases by modifying the structure of its securitization facility such that it is considered nonrecourse debt under generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  no gain on sale of lease receivables was recorded during the fourth quarter of gains from sale and re leasing of leased equipment increased from million to million 
the increase was the result of a greater number of leases maturing in during  the company experienced increases in the value of certain equity participation rights held by the company and consequently elected to sell a portion of these rights  realizing a gain of million 
during  the company sold certain equity participation rights  realizing a gain of million 
other income  which consists primarily of interim rents received by select growth finance and late fees  increased from million to million  primarily due to the increase in the volume of select growth finance leases originated and late fees collected by vendor finance 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million to million  net of initial direct costs capitalized 
the increase resulted primarily from additional operations  marketing and sales personnel associated with the company s re entry into portfolio finance  senior and middle management personnel added to support the company s growth  three acquisitions completed in  and increased activity in the company s other business segments 
the number of people employed  including employees of companies acquired  increased to during interest expense increased from million to million  due primarily to increased lease originations  lease portfolios acquired  and retention of more leases on the balance sheet following discontinuance of gain on sale accounting  with the resulting increase in borrowings 
lease originations  including portfolios of acquired companies  increased over the prior year 
depreciation of equipment increased from million to million  which was attributable to an increase in equipment held for operating leases 
the average net book value of equipment held for rental and operating leases increased approximately over the prior year 
goodwill amortization of million increased from less than million in  due to three acquisitions completed in the first half of the provision for credit losses increased from million to million  due to a substantially higher volume of new leases originated and re evaluation of reserves 
lease fundings  excluding portfolios acquired in connection with the company s acquisitions  increased over the prior year 
the company s effective tax rate was for and compared to net earnings for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted common share compared to million  or per diluted common share for the year ended december  the increase in net earnings in compared to is primarily a result of a substantially higher level of finance lease receivables and the completion of a securitization in  offset somewhat by a higher level of average borrowings and an increase in selling  general and administrative expense in the company s select growth finance and portfolio finance activities and increased earnings contributions from the company s rental and distribution activities 
sales of equipment increased from million to million and costs of analytical instruments sold increased from million to million due to an increase in market penetration in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  offset by the consolidation in the environmental testing industry 
net margin on sales of analytical instruments was in and in direct finance lease income increased from million to million as a result of a substantially higher level of finance lease receivables outstanding 
net investment in direct finance leases and loans increased from million to million due to increased marketing and selling activities 
new lease origination s increased period to period 
interest income increased from million to million primarily due to an increase in interest bearing notes receivable held by the company

the increase in operating lease revenue is primarily a result of the company re entering the portfolio finance and lease acquisition business upon the expiration of a non compete agreement in september as a consequence of the continuing decline in the number of leases serviced by the company for unrelated parties  fee income declined from million to million 
during  the company securitized leases with a book value of million  net of bad debt reserves of million 
in connection with the securitization  the company realized a gain on the sale of lease receivables of million 
no securitization occurred in gains from sale and re leasing of leased equipment increased from million to million 
the increase in gains from resulted from increased lease maturities in the company sold certain of its equity participation rights  realizing gains of million and million in and  respectively 
other income  which consists primarily of interim rents received and fees earned in connection with select growth finance commitments  increased from million to million  primarily due to the increase in the volume of select growth finance leases originated by the company in selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to increases in operations  marketing and sales personnel associated with the company s select growth finance activities and the re initiation of portfolio finance activities  as well as increases in information systems expenditures  partially offset by a decrease in expenses of rental and distribution activities 
interest expense increased from million to million  due primarily to an increase in average borrowings 
the increase in average borrowings resulted from increased direct finance lease originations by select growth finance as well as leases added by portfolio finance 
average borrowings for benefited somewhat from the utilization of the proceeds from the offering in november to reduce borrowings under the senior credit facility 
depreciation of equipment increased from million to million as a result of the increase in equipment under rental agreements related to rental and distribution activities and an increase in operating leases as the result of portfolio finance activities 
goodwill amortization increased to million  due to the purchase of the minority interest in a subsidiary of the company in the provision for credit losses increased from million to million  due to the volume of new leases originated 
however  such provisions declined from to of direct finance lease receivables at the end of the respective periods  as a result of the lower loss provisions related to the company s portfolio finance activities 
the company s effective tax rate decreased from to  resulting from a reduction in state income tax rates in and the corresponding reduction in deferred taxes for prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s activities are capital intensive and require access to substantial amounts of credit to fund new equipment leases 
the company has financed its operations to date primarily through cash flow from operations  through borrowings under its senior credit facility  its securitization facility  and other non recourse and recourse loans and through the sale of equity 
the company will continue to require access to large amounts of capital to acquire equipment for lease and rental  as well as to fund its portfolio finance activities 
the company expects that its current sources of capital will continue to be available  and anticipates raising debt and or equity financing from other providers during to supplement existing capital sources 
cash flow cash flows from operating and financing activities are generated primarily from receipts on direct finance leases and rentals of analytical instruments  gross profit on the sale of analytical instruments  realization of equipment residual values  and financing of new lease origination s and rental inventory through credit facilities and securitizations 
cash flows from operating and financing activities for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the period to period increases result primarily from securitizations completed in and and additional borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
credit facilities the company utilizes secured revolving credit and term loan facilities provided by a syndicate of banks to fund the acquisition and origination of leases and the purchase of analytical instruments 
as of december   the company had a maximum of million available for borrowing under this facility  of which the company had borrowed million 
the facility matures october  at which time the remaining balance of the facility may be converted to a term loan maturing october  the company typically seeks to renew this facility prior to maturity 
securitization facility in  the company entered into a securitization facility in an initial amount of million 
the facility was increased to million  million  and million  during the second  third  and fourth quarters of  respectively 
at december   million of the facility was utilized 
the terms of the facility permit the securitization of substantially all of the leases originated in the company s portfolio finance  vendor finance  and rental and distribution activities as well as the majority of the leases originated in the company s select growth finance activities 
at the time of placing leases in the securitization facility  the company enters into interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
other recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt the standard no later than the first quarter of year and is in the process of determining the impact that adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements 
year compliance year compliance refers to the ability of computer hardware and software to respond to the problems posed by the fact that computer programs have traditionally been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a consequence  unless modified  computer systems will not be able to differentiate between the year and failure to address this problem could result in system failures and the generation of erroneous data 
the company s lease tracking information technology systems have been certified or contractually guaranteed to be year compliant by the software vendors 
the company s financial and accounts payable information systems are year compliant except for certain of the systems of the companies acquired in as part of its integration strategy  the company is currently converting the information on the non compliant systems of the acquired companies onto its own systems 
the company also has several other systems  including voice mail and phone systems  which use dates electronically that are being reviewed for compliance 
the company expects to have all systems year compliant by the end of the first quarter of and plans to complete comprehensive  full system testing in the second quarter of the company is making inquiries of significant third parties  with which the company conducts business  to determine their year readiness 
based on responses to date  the company believes that these third parties  including parties to the company s credit facilities and its significant portfolio finance customers  are year compliant or will be year compliant by the end of the third quarter 
based on information available at this time  including the year compliance status of information technology systems as well as the anticipated replacement costs for non compliant systems  the company has concluded that the costs for the correction of year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  there can be no assurance of unforeseen problems in its own computer systems or computer systems of third parties with which the company conducts business 
such problems  depending on the extent and nature  could materially and adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
based on its assessment of the year issue to date  the company has not developed a contingency plan for its own systems 
however  as part of the company s routine back up servicing capabilities  the company has a contingency plan for system failures for its significant portfolio finance customers 
the company believes it could provide servicing of the lease portfolios purchased by the company from its significant portfolio finance customers on its own lease tracking systems if their systems fail to meet the requirements of year additionally  the company continues to assess the impact of year issues on its own systems and those of significant third parties with which the company conducts business and will create additional contingency plans if considered warranted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk  largely related to the company s senior credit facility and securitization retained interest 
otherwise  the company is able to mitigate the effects of changes in interest rates through financing leases or loans on a nonrecourse or partial recourse basis at fixed interest rates  which maintains the spread on lease or loan transactions over their terms 
in addition  the company manages exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by establishing fixed interest rates on the lease portfolios in the company s securitization facility through interest rate swap and cap agreements 
interest rates associated with new originations of leases or loans can be adjusted to compensate for changes in the interest rate environment 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to adverse fluctuations in interest rates as they relate to the company s securitization retained interest and to leases and loans funded under its senior credit facility 
additionally  the company could be negatively impacted by the early termination of its interest rate swap or interest rate cap agreements based on the fair value of these derivative financial instruments on the date of termination 
at december   termination of the interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements would have resulted in a charge to earnings of million 
the company s securitization retained interest is classified as a trading investment  and consequently  is recorded on the balance sheet at market value  net of an allowance for doubtful receivables  with unrealized gains or losses reported in the statement of earnings 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the market value of the investment since the market value is estimated based on a discounted cash flow approach using the interest rate the company would expect to apply in a sale of the investment at period end 
changes in loss expectancy arising from defaults could also affect the market value and ultimately the recoverability of the securitization retained interest 
the company continuously monitors loss expectancy and would record a charge to earnings for any material decrease in the expected recoverability of the securitization retained interest in the period in which such event occurred 
at december   the net effect of a basis point decrease or increase in three year treasury rates over a twelve month period would result in a million unrealized gain or loss reported in the statement of earnings 
the company funds a portion of its lease portfolio under its senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility provides for interest at libor plus to or  at the company s option  prime plus up to or the cd rate or the fed funds rate plus to  with the precise rate dependent on certain leverage tests 
an increase in these interest rates would cause a decrease in the spread between the yield on the lease or loan contract and the company s borrowing costs 
at december   the net effect of a basis point decrease or increase in libor over a twelve month period would result in a million decrease or increase in interest expense for the period 
if actual interest rates are different from those estimated by the company  the net impact of interest rate risk on the company s earnings may be materially different than disclosed above 
the company is also subject to foreign currency rate risk relating to a limited number of leases denominated in canadian dollars and british pounds 
the company has determined that hedging of these assets is not cost effective and instead attempts to minimize currency exposure risk through working capital management 
the company does not believe that any foreseeable change in currency rates would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the table below presents the principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates of the company s securitization retained interest  debt obligations  and derivative financial instruments by expected year of maturity 
thereafter total in thousands assets securitization retained interest      weighted average interest rate liabilities senior credit facility   variable rate other notes payable    weighted average interest rate recourse and nonrecourse debt       weighted average interest rate subordinated debt    weighted average interest rate off balance sheet financial instruments interest rate swaps        weighted average fixed interest rate interest rate caps       weighted average fixed interest rate the table above reflects the expected maturity of the company s retained interest  debt obligations  and derivative financial instruments as of december  and does not reflect changes which could arise after that time 
additionally  because the company s lease portfolio is not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on exposures that arise during the respective period  the company s hedging strategies at the time  and actual interest rates
