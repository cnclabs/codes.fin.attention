on the unused portion of the facility 
the loan agreement with finova contains customary covenants

we are in compliance with  or have obtained waivers from finova for  the covenants stated above 
year issue overview we are continuing our formal program to address the effect of the year issue on our information systems and operations 
the year issue arises because many computer programs were originally designed with abbreviated dates that eliminate the first two digits of any given year  assuming that such digits are always 
as a result  on january   non year compliant computer programs may incorrectly recognize the date as january  this would result in incorrect results from calculations and processes using these dates  and in some cases computer systems and applications may cease processing completely 
this effect will also be seen before january  if noncompliant software is processing calculations using dates after december  in order to address this problem we have established a formal written year compliance program to investigate and correct year problems in our primary computer systems 
all departments in our company and our subsidiaries are participating in this formal program  using a standardized methodology 
current initiatives we have installed a new financial system and are in the process of upgrading our central station monitoring systems 
the purpose of these upgrades is to allow for efficient financial management and to provide a standard platform for all central stations and allow all of the central stations to be linked electronically 
in addition to verifying our internal compliance  we are formally surveying outside vendors whose systems pose a significant year risk 
these companies include the principal telephone companies serving our stations  central station software vendors  telephone hardware and software vendors  financial institutions and payroll companies 
vendors with material year compliance issues will be replaced 
progress to date we completed the installation of a new financial system in february  and plan to complete our central station system upgrade by the third quarter of these upgrades will also ensure that all computer systems are ready to process the year date change without disruption 
we are confident that most of our systems already satisfy year requirements and expect that all internal systems will be in full compliance by the third quarter of we have sent surveys to all of our principal vendors and are in the process of reviewing the responses we have received to date 
the target date for completing the vendor reviews is june  estimated costs the total cost of these upgrades are expected to be approximately  of which approximately  has been expended through february  our board of directors has approved the necessary capital expenditures to complete the program 
reasonable worst case scenario we have assessed our business exposures that would result from the failure of our year program  as well as those of our suppliers and customers 
such failures would result in business consequences that could include the failure to receive alarm signals and render the necessary service to our customers  lost revenue  harm to our reputation  legal and regulatory exposures  and the failure of management controls 
although we believe that our internal systems are year compliant  there can be no assurance that the year problem will not have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contingency plans we are in the process of establishing a contingency plan to mitigate the year problem 
this plan includes full redundancy of all central station operating systems  so that in the event one central station cannot receive signals due to power failure  the signals can be monitored by another central station providing that the national telecommunications network remains functional 
if the local electrical systems were to fail  all of our central stations are equipped with backup generators which would enable us to continue to monitor at each location for an extended period of time 
as our industry is heavily dependent on the telecommunications providers  we would not be able to operate if the telecommunications systems on which we depend fail 
we are investigating contracting with backup telecommunications providers to minimize the impact of our primary carrier failing

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not invest excess funds in derivative financial instruments or other market rate sensitive instruments for the purpose of managing interest rate risk or for any other purpose 
we incur debt from three sources dealers from whom we acquire subscriber accounts  senior debt from finova and fixed rate subordinated debt from tjs 
debt owed to dealers is in the form of a holdback note which guarantees the aggregate revenue produced by subscriber accounts purchased from the dealer for a period of time 
these notes are non interest bearing and comprise less than of our total debt 
we have  in subordinated debt due to tjs which is at a fixed rate of and matures in january  we have  in senior debt due to finova at an interest rate of prime plus 
the prime rate applicable to this debt was at december  we do not have exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and do not use derivatives for trading purposes
