the company entered into the above transactions to serve as economic hedges for the purchase of t n 
such transactions  however  do not qualify for hedge accounting under gaap  and therefore both the loss on the british pound currency option and the gain on the british pound forward contract are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations caption net gain loss on british pound currency option and forward contract 
other expense  net the increase in other expense  net  of million in to million is due to the expense related to the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities  issued in december  partially offset by an increase in earnings from equity investments acquired in the t n acquisition and a gain on the divestiture of its minority interest in g

as a result of these transactions  the company will recognize an extraordinary charge in the first quarter of of approximately million  net of tax  related to the early extinguishment of debt 
the company believes that cash flows from operations  together with borrowings available under the company s multicurrency revolving credit facility  will continue to be sufficient to meet its ongoing working capital requirements 
litigation and environmental matters t n asbestos litigation in the united states  the company s united kingdom subsidiary  t n ltd  and two of t n s united states subsidiaries the t n companies are among many defendants named in numerous court actions alleging personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products 
t n is also subject to asbestos disease litigation  to a lesser extent  in the united kingdom and to property damage litigation in the united states based upon asbestos products allegedly installed in buildings 
because of the slow onset of asbestos related diseases  management anticipates that similar claims will be made in the future 
it is not known how many such claims may be made nor the expenditure which may arise therefrom 
as of december   the company has provided approximately billion as its best estimate for future costs related to resolving asbestos claims 
the company estimates claims will be filed and paid in excess of the next years 
this estimate is based in part on recent and historical claims experience  medical information and the current legal environment 
as of december   the t n companies had approximately  claims pending 
during  approximately  new claims were filed and  claims were settled  dismissed or otherwise resolved 
in addition to the pending cases above  the t n companies have approximately  claims that have been settled but will be paid over time 
there are a number of factors that could impact the settlement costs into the future  including but not limited to changes in legal environment  possible insolvency of co defendants  and the establishment of an acceptable administrative non litigation claims resolution mechanism 
as of december   t n is one of a large number of defendants named in three pending property damage cases pending in two jurisdictions 
provision has been made in the asbestos reserve for anticipated expenditures in relation to such cases 
the billion total provision held for the t n companies is comprised of an estimate for known claims pending and settled but not paid and possible future claims ibnr 
as of december   the billion total provision is comprised of approximately million related to known claims and approximately million related to ibnr claims 
in arriving at the ibnr provision  assumptions have been made regarding the total number of claims which it is anticipated may be received in the future  the typical cost of settlement which is sensitive to the industry in which the plaintiff claims exposure  the alleged disease type and the jurisdiction in which the action is being brought  the rate of receipt of claims and the timing of settlement and  in the united kingdom  the level of subrogation claims brought by insurance companies 
the t n companies have appointed the center for claims resolution ccr as their exclusive representative in relation to all asbestos related personal injury claims made against the t n companies in the united states 
the ccr provides to its member companies a litigation defense  claims handling and management s discussion and analysis continued administration service in respect to united states asbestos related disease claims 
pursuant to the ccr producer agreement  t n is entitled to appoint a representative as one of the five voting directors on the ccr s board of directors 
members of the ccr contribute towards indemnity payments in each claim in which the member is named 
contributions to such indemnity payments are calculated on a case by case basis according to sharing agreements among the ccr s members 
in  t n purchased a pounds million approximately million at the insurance agreement exchange rate of pounds layer of insurance which will be triggered should the aggregate amount of claims filed after june   where the exposure occurred prior to that date  exceed pounds million approximately  million at the pounds exchange rate 
the company s reserve for claims filed after june  approximates the trigger point of the insurance 
the company has reviewed the financial viability and legal obligations of the three reinsurance companies involved and has concluded at this time that there is little risk of the reinsurers not being able to meet their obligation to pay  should the claims filed after june  exceed the pounds million trigger point 
while management believes that reserves are appropriate for anticipated losses arising from t n s asbestos related claims  given the nature and complexity of the factors affecting the estimated liability  the actual liability may differ 
no absolute assurances can be given that t n will not be subject to material additional liabilities and significant additional litigation relating to asbestos 
in the possible  but unlikely  event that such liabilities exceed the reserves recorded by the company and the additional pounds million of insurance coverage  the company s results of operations  business  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the t n companies reserves will be reevaluated periodically as additional information becomes available 
federal mogul  fel pro and cooper automotive asbestos litigation the company also is one of a large number of defendants in a number of lawsuits brought by claimants alleging injury due to exposure to asbestos 
fel pro has been named as a defendant in a number of product liability cases involving asbestos  primarily involving gasket or packing products sold to ship owners 
in addition  subsidiaries of cooper automotive have been named as defendants in a number of product liability cases involving asbestos  primarily involving friction products 
the company is defending all such claims vigorously and believes that it  fel pro and the cooper automotive subsidiaries have substantial defenses to liability and adequate insurance coverage for defense and indemnity 
while the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that asbestos claims pending against the company  fel pro and the cooper automotive subsidiaries as of december   will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
at december   approximately million in related reserves have been provided in respect of the possible uninsured portion of the expenditures on asbestos claims pending against the company  fel pro and the cooper automotive subsidiaries 
environmental matters the company is a defendant in lawsuits filed in various jurisdictions pursuant to the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of cercla or other similar federal or state environmental laws which require responsible parties to pay for cleaning up contamination resulting from hazardous wastes which were discharged into the environment by them or by others to which they sent such wastes for disposition 
in addition  the company has been notified by the united states environmental protection agency and various state agencies that it may be a potentially responsible party prp under such law for the cost of cleaning up certain other hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities pursuant to cercla and other federal and state environmental laws 
prp designation requires the funding of site investigations and subsequent remedial activities 
at most of the sites that are likely to be costliest to clean up  which are often current or management s discussion and analysis continued former commercial waste disposal facilities to which numerous companies sent waste  the company s exposure is expected to be limited 
despite the joint and several liability which might be imposed on the company under cerlca and some of the other laws pertaining to these sites  the company s share of the total waste is usually quite small  the other companies which also sent wastes  often numbering in the hundreds or more  generally include large  solvent publicly owned companies  and in most such situations the government agencies and courts have imposed liability in some reasonable relationship to contribution of waste 
in addition  the company has identified certain present and former properties at which it may be responsible for cleaning up environmental contamination 
the company is actively seeking to resolve these matters 
although difficult to quantify based on the complexity of the issues  the company has accrued the estimated cost associated with such matters based upon current available information from site investigations and consultants 
the environmental and legal reserve was approximately million at december  and million at december  the majority of the increase is attributable to the acquisitions of t n and cooper automotive 
management believes that such accruals will be adequate to cover the company s estimated liability for its exposure in respect of such matters 
market risk in the normal course of business  the company is subject to market exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and raw material prices 
to manage a portion of these inherent risks  the company purchases various derivative financial instruments and commodity futures contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk a substantial portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures and sells its products in north america  europe  south america  africa and asia 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the united states dollar and european currencies 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international businesses into united states dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
the company does not generally hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
as of december   the company s net assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk are million 
the potential decrease in net assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
the company monitors certain aspects of its foreign currency activities and larger transactions through the use of foreign currency options or forwards 
the company generally tries to utilize natural hedges within their foreign currency activities  including the matching of revenues and costs 
the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the british pound against the united states dollar in the amount of million with an average contract rate of pounds and an unrealized loss of million at december  the company has also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the british pound against the south african rand in the amount of million with an average contract rate of rand pounds and an unrealized loss of million at december  management s discussion and analysis continued the company has also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency debt exposures from the british pound to the australian dollar  swiss franc  german mark  danish krone  spanish peseta  french franc  hong kong dollar  italian lira  japanese yen and swedish krona whose notional amounts and related unrealized gains or losses are not material 
all foreign currency forward contracts purchased will expire within the next twelve months 
interest rate risk the company s variable interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
some of the company s interest expense is fixed through long term borrowings to mitigate the impact of such potential exposure 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

the net unrealized losses at december  for commodity contracts were million 
other matters year costs the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company has established a team that has completed an awareness program and assessment project to address the year issue including information technology it and non it systems 
in addition  the board of directors has received status reports related to the company s progress in addressing the year issue 
the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company has initiated remediation and testing  and is implementing the action plan to address the year issue and management s discussion and analysis continued estimates that the majority of testing will be completed by the end of the first quarter of a number of independent third party reviews have been performed and others are planned 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could cause production interruptions that could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated development of contingency plans and will continue to do so throughout the program 
the company has initiated formal communications with a substantial majority of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine their plans to address the year issue 
while the company expects a successful resolution of all issues  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be converted in a timely manner  or that a failure to convert by a supplier or customer  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has determined it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company has contracts in place with external resources and has allocated internal resources to reprogram or replace  and test the hardware and software for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated to be million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
these estimates have been verified by independent third party audit 
of the total project cost  approximately million is attributable to the purchase of new hardware and software which will be capitalized 
maintenance and repair of existing systems to be expensed as incurred is expected to be approximately million 
as of december   the company has incurred and expensed approximately million and capitalized approximately million 
the costs of the project and the date which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases  the company would be unable to take customer orders  manufacture and ship products  invoice customers or collect payments 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company has contingency plans for certain critical applications and is working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing inventories  and adjusting staffing strategies 
euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union irrevocably fixed the conversion rates between their national currencies and a common currency  the euro  which became their legal currency on that date 
the participating countries former national currencies continue to exist as denominations of the euro management s discussion and analysis continued until january  the company has established a steering committee that is monitoring the business implications of conversion to the euro  including the need to adapt internal systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions 
the acquisition of t n has provided the company with a strong knowledge base in which to assist with the conversion 
while the company is still in various stages of assessment and implementation  the company does not expect the conversion to the euro to have a material affect on its financial condition or results of operations 
effect of accounting pronouncements in  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting the costs of start up activities 
sop is effective january   and requires that start up costs capitalized prior to january  be written off and any future start up costs be expensed as incurred 
the unamortized balance of start up costs will be written off as a cumulative effect of an accounting change of approximately million  net of tax  as of january  in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company expects to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement requires the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial condition
