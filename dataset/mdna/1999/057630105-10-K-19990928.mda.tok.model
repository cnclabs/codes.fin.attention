on february   the company completed its initial public offering for  shares of its common stock  par value 
per share common stock at a price of per share the offering 
concurrent with the offering  the  shares of series b preferred stock and  shares of series a preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock reflective of the three for four reverse split of common stock effective october  
in connection with the offering  the company granted the underwriters an option to purchase  additional shares of common stock at per share 
the closing for this option was on march  the offering  including the exercise of the underwriters option  generated proceeds to the company of approximately  net of costs and underwriting discounts and commissions 
the proceeds were used to repay indebtedness of approximately  incurred to fund the purchase of four acquisitions seven facilities completed from october through january  and to pay off indebtedness of  related to the company s wisconsin assisted living facilities in anticipation of their sale 
the balance of the offering was used for general corporate purposes 
the company has grown primarily through acquisitions and by designing  developing  operating and managing its outlook pointe r signature series assisted living facilities 
the following table summarizes the company s operating facilities at june  and june  owned leased managed total owned leased managed total developed assisted living facilities acquired assisted living facilities skilled nursing facilities independent living facilities as of june   the company has operations in pennsylvania  missouri  arkansas  ohio  virginia  north carolina  tennessee  west virginia and florida 
these operating facilities have a capacity for  assisted living residents   skilled nursing patients and independent living residents 
the company also operates a home health care agency in missouri and rehabilitation therapy operations in pennsylvania and arkansas 
in december  the company sold its seven owned assisted living facilities in wisconsin  which had been carried as an asset held for sale since june  in addition to the outlook pointe r signature series assisted living facilities opened as of june   the company has signed agreements to develop and manage an additional assisted living facilities currently under construction  which are scheduled to open at various dates through april in addition to increasing the depth of the company s operations in pennsylvania  missouri  arkansas  ohio  virginia  north carolina  tennessee  west virginia and florida  the construction will add operations in indiana and maryland 
the company generates revenue from four primary sources patient services  resident services  development fees and management fees 
patient services revenues include charges for room and board  rehabilitation therapies  pharmacy  medical supplies  subacute care  homehealth  and other programs provided to patients in skilled nursing facilities as well as rehabilitation and homehealth services provided to assisted living facility residents 
resident services include all revenues earned from services provided to assisted living facility residents except revenues for therapies and home health care services provided by the company s licensed agencies which are included in patient services revenues 
development fees and management fees are earned for developing and managing assisted living facilities for real estate investment trusts reit and other owners or lessees 
as the company implements its business plan  management believes that the mix of the company s revenues will continue to change and that revenues from assisted living resident services will increase as a percentage of total revenues 
the company classifies its operating expenses into the following categories i facility operating expenses which include labor  food  marketing  rehabilitation therapy costs and other direct facility expenses  ii development  general and administrative expenses  which primarily include corporate office expenses  regional office expenses  development expenses and other overhead costs  iii provisions for losses  which include losses relating to the curtailment of development activities which were previously capitalized  losses relating to working capital advances made under shortfall funding agreements  and losses from severance agreements  iv bad debt expense for the skilled nursing  assisted living and therapy services  v lease expense which includes rent for the facilities operated by the company as well as corporate office and other rent  and vi depreciation and amortization 
in anticipation of its planned growth  the company made significant investments in its infrastructure during fiscal and these investments included attracting management and regional personnel and installing information systems to support and manage growth 
strategic changes and charges to operations as discussed in prior reports  the company s development activities are significantly affected by volatility in the capital markets and specific transaction terms which affect the company s ability to utilize non binding financing commitments from real estate investment trusts reits and other lenders 
more specifically  the availability of reit financing has become substantially limited for new assisted living construction 
furthermore  the ability of the company to negotiate acceptable transaction terms and to currently recognize income on development fees has become increasingly difficult due to accounting pronouncements and guidance issued by the emerging issues task force eitf and the securities and exchange commission staff 
finally  the company s leverage ie debt and other financial commitments in relation to equity has increased due to its extensive use of operating leases to finance the construction of its outlook pointe r assisted living facilities 
as a direct result of the foregoing  the company has been unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms to continue development of its outlook pointe r signature series assisted living facilities 
in recognition of these events and circumstances  in fiscal  the company i concluded that development fees on new projects would not qualify for income recognition under contract terms considered acceptable by management  ii decided to emphasize the focus of management s efforts on the operations of existing facilities and or facilities which are under construction  iii decided to substantially reduce its development activities with respect to new sites and projects  and iv recorded a provision for losses on development activities of  this provision is based on management s evaluation of capitalized costs  including land option payments and includes substantially all of the previously capitalized costs relating to the precontract phase of development activities 
management has taken these steps to focus on building market share in existing markets  to channel its financial and human resources into meeting facility occupancy goals  and to build brand recognition throughout the balanced care continuum of services 
the company had assisted living facilities under construction at june   all with financing agreements 
if and when  capital becomes available to the company on acceptable terms  the company expects to implement a program of limited development consisting of approximately four to five projects per quarter that meet the company s development standards 
due to the downscaling of development activity of the company s outlook pointe r facilities  management adopted a corporate restructuring plan in fiscal affecting certain departments and staff positions 
this restructuring plan resulted in non recurring charges of approximately  representing the estimated costs of employee terminations and related costs to exit these activities 
the company expects these actions to reduce development  general and administrative expenses by approximately  annually 
the cost savings will be partially offset by incremental increases in development general and administrative expenses related to the company s increased investment in marketing and regional operating positions 
in addition to the charge of  related to the reduction of development activities  certain of the outlook pointe r signature series assisted living facilities had experienced slower than budgeted census ramp ups and  as a result  incurred greater than budgeted negative cash flows from start up operations 
during fiscal  the company incurred losses related to obligations under the shortfall funding agreements discussed in more detail under business development in part i of this report in the amount of  to fund the additional working capital needs of these managed facilities 
this amount has been charged to operations as a provision for losses under the shortfall funding agreements and recorded as an allowance against receivables on advances to operator lessees 
of the outlook pointe r facilities open or under construction and managed by the company at june   the company estimates it may be required to make future working capital shortfall contributions in connection with managed projects 
the company estimates that it may be required to make additional funding advances of  through june  the additional working capital needs relate primarily to projects that closed on construction financing on or before march  census trends operationally  the company has begun to see the results of the company s emphasis on operations and marketing implemented in february by the end of the fiscal year  the company improved its average census absorption rate at the outlook pointe r signature series assisted living communities from residents per building for the september  quarter to residents per building for the last three months 
the company attributes this improvement to the company s increased investment in marketing  a new professionally trained and managed sales team  and a focused community outreach initiative over the past months 
we believe the positive effects of the marketing and sales training program and the refined positioning of the product in the marketplace will continue to increase the company s average quarterly census absorption rate

the balanced budget act of the budget act enacted sweeping changes in reimbursement methodology for skilled nursing facilities 
beginning july   skilled nursing providers with year ends of june  were reimbursed under a fixed payment methodology based upon the patient s level of care as opposed to a cost based methodology 
the new methodology assigns patients into resource utilization groupings rug that have corresponding fixed per diem rates 
the new methodology has a three year phase in program whereby providers will receive a blending of historical facility specific cost and national average rates 
the facility specific costs are based on audited cost reports 
the national average rates are the health care financing administration s hcfa s compilation of all skilled nursing cost reports with adjustments made to reduce or eliminate certain data 
the company s skilled nursing facilities began utilizing this new rate methodology on july  to maximize operating results under the new regulations the company embarked upon a program to reduce costs and manage acuity levels 
these steps included i a re negotiation of therapy service contracts  ii a reduction of nursing costs through managing hours worked to patient acuity  iii evaluation of the need for high cost programs  and iv consolidating and eliminating certain non patient related services 
the financial impact of these operational changes and the new medicare reimbursement rates are reflected in the fiscal operating results 
liquidity and capital resources as the company changed its focus to operations from development  the company s capital requirements and sources also changed 
historically the company primarily sought development and acquisition capital  using development fees to support operating losses and corporate overhead 
with the increased emphasis on operations the company entered into financing transactions to access liquidity to provide the funds to support the operating team s efforts 
in march  the company received approximately million in cash through the sale leaseback of two of its owned facilities located in bloomsburg and saxonburg  pennsylvania with an independent third party the sale leaseback transaction under a fifteen year lease agreement at an annual lease rate of in april  the company entered into a million revolving line of credit 
the line of credit is secured by the real estate owned by five of the company s subsidiaries bcc at darlington  inc  balanced care at eyers grove  inc  balanced care at butler  inc  balanced care at sarver  inc 
and balanced care at north ridge  inc collectively  the real estate borrowers and the eligible accounts receivable of the company s missouri skilled nursing facilities 
the line of credit is for a term of three years  and outstanding borrowings will bear interest at a rate per annum of prime plus 
in july  the terms of the line of credit agreement were amended 
the first amendment modified certain definitions and provisions and the borrowing base calculation 
the second amendment increased the line of credit to million and added to the lender s secured interest the real estate of two of the company s subsidiaries bcc at republic park care center  inc and bcc at nevada park care center  inc together  the skilled nursing facility borrowers 
the primary component of the borrowing base for the amended and restated line of credit that the company is utilizing consists of of the product of to times ebitda of the real estate borrowers plus of the product of times ebitda of the skilled nursing facility borrowers 
including the amendments to the line of credit agreement  the borrowing base available calculated as of june  was approximately million 
at june   million was borrowed under the line of credit 
in a simultaneous transaction with the second amendment to the line of credit  the company repaid the outstanding debt of million for the real estate of two of its nursing home subsidiaries located in republic and nevada  missouri 
as a result of this transaction  the company expects to report a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal the company has opened of its outlook pointe r signature series assisted living facilities as of june  as previously discussed  the company has stopped seeking additional sites for outlook pointe r facilities 
the company has adequate financing to complete construction on the facilities under construction at june  these facilities are expected to open on various dates through april the company has terminated  or allowed the expiration of  significantly all of its land options on previously secured sites 
the company s costs associated with these cancelled land options are reflected in the provision for estimated losses from development activities 
the company had previously disclosed its expectations to develop more than facilities during fiscal as a result of the company s revised development strategy  and the ongoing difficulty in obtaining development capital on acceptable terms  the company closed on construction financing for six development projects during fiscal if  and when  capital becomes available to the company on acceptable terms  the company will implement a program of limited development consisting of approximately four to five projects per quarter that meet the company s development standards 
the company s development projects have generally involved entering into development agreements with third party owners  which are typically reits each  an owner 
a third party operator lessee leases the assisted living facility from the owner when construction has been completed and provides funding for the working capital during the initial occupancy period 
the company manages the assisted living facility pursuant to a management agreement for a term of two to nine years in return for a management fee approximating of the net revenue of the facility 
the foregoing off balance sheet financing structure is referred to as the black box structure 
for development projects utilizing the black box structure  the company has the option to purchase the equity or assets of the operator lessee at a purchase price based on a formula set forth in an option agreement and a shortfall funding agreement  respectively 
as consideration for the option  which is exercisable by the company at any time during the term of the option agreement  the company pays option payments to the operator lessee 
without the owner s prior consent  the operator lessee may not sell its equity or assets to any third party other than the company 
the company has closed development projects for which the company holds the foregoing type of option 
between march and june  the company exercised its option to purchase the operator lessee s equity interests in five projects financed under the black box structure for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in conjunction with the purchase transactions  the company increased the lease base of the five facilities by million 
these projects are located in harrisburg  altoona and reading  pennsylvania and in sherwood and mountain home  arkansas 
the company estimates it will require approximately million to buy the equity of the outlook pointe facilities that remain under the black box structure over the next three years 
the company has obtained commitments from certain reits that currently own developed properties under the black box structure to finance the company s capital requirements to exercise its purchase options under the aforementioned option agreements 
generally  this take out financing will be structured as an increase to the existing facility lease base at a blended annual lease rate 
this financing structure will provide approximately million of the estimated million capital requirement 
the balance will be funded with cash raised from financing transactions discussed above  possible asset divestitures and cash to be provided from operations 
the company plans to exercise its options to purchase the equity interests on approximately of its managed operations during fiscal as reported in the section titled charges to operations  the company has incurred a cumulative charge of million representing advances made for the operations of facilities financed under the black box structure under existing shortfall funding agreements 
the company estimates additional shortfall funding requirements through june  to be approximately million as the result of additional black box working capital financing 
the company currently is using more than million each month to support corporate overhead and fund facility operating shortfalls 
this amount is generally decreasing each month as facilities become more profitable as a result of increased census and cost reduction measures 
the company s other significant cash need is the million required to make option payments and buy back black box operations over the next two to three years 
the company will endeavor to make all option payments to preserve its purchase option  but may delay the purchase of black box operations  depending on capital availability 
by continuing to make option payments the company can preserve its right to acquire profitable assisted living facilities it currently manages 
however  the profitable results will not be consolidated in the company s financial statements until the purchase option is exercised 
the company would continue to receive management fees under the scenario 
at august   the company had a borrowing base under the line of credit of approximately million and had borrowed million 
between existing cash balances  remaining borrowing base  anticipated formula increases to the borrowing base of million and refinancing or selling non core assets of million  the company expects to have adequate sources of liquidity to finance operations through fiscal the company believes that in order to satisfy its current and future capital needs  it will be necessary to i increase the borrowing base availability on the line of credit through improved performance of the real estate borrowers and negotiation of an increased ebitda multiple in the borrowing base calculation for the skilled nursing facility borrowers  ii obtain additional equity to meet working capital needs  and iii divest certain non core assets 
the company believes with its current financing arrangements in place or currently under negotiation that it will generate the cash needed to i maintain existing operations  ii make the required purchase option payments under these commitments and iii acquire all black box operations upon breakeven 
notwithstanding the foregoing  there can be no assurance that any additional financing needed to fund the company s liquidity and growth will be available 
most of the facilities operated by the company are leased under long term operating leases 
facility obligations for the next months are approximately  the lease documents contain financial covenants and other restrictions which i require the company to meet certain financial tests and maintain certain escrow funds  ii limit  among other things  the ability of the company and certain of its subsidiaries to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets or engage in mergers or other business combinations  and iii prohibit the company from operating competing facilities within a designated radius of existing facilities 
management believes the company is in compliance with these lease covenants 
the company s lease arrangements are generally for initial terms of to years with aggregate renewal terms ranging from to years and provide for contractually fixed rent plus additional rent  subject to certain limits 
the additional rent is capped at to of the prior year s total rent and is based on either the annual increase in gross revenues of the facility or the increase in the consumer price index 
the company s lease arrangements generally contain an option to purchase the facility at its fair market value at the end of the initial lease term and each renewal term 
in september  the company entered into management agreements  option agreements and other transaction documents with six operator lessees that are owned by financial care investors  llc  a delaware limited liability company fci 
fci is owned by brad e 
hollinger  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer of the company 
fci and its six wholly owned operator lessees also entered into lease agreements with a reit 
the terms of the agreements among the parties are similar to the terms of the agreements the company has entered into with independent third party operator lessees 
in october  mr 
hollinger expects to redeem his investment interest in fci for nominal consideration 
operating activities cash used by operations increased by  to  for fiscal from cash used by operations of  for fiscal the increase in the cash used was due to increased operating losses and an increase in development contracts in process offset by a decrease in receivables and an increase in accounts payable  accrued payroll and accrued expenses
