page recently  certain of the company s large customers delayed making purchasing decisions with respect to certain of the company s large software systems comprised of multiple products  resulting in longer sales cycles for such systems 
management believes such delays are due to a number of factors  including customer organizational changes  governmental approvals  product complexity  competition  and customer preoccupation with internal year issues 
the company is unable to determine and is therefore uncertain whether such factors constitute a trend or will continue in future periods 
on september   the company entered into a merger agreement with edix corporation edix  a provider of medical transcription services with annual revenues of approximately million

prior to the merger with phamis  technological feasibility was determined differently by idx and phamis 
subsequent to the merger  the company s determination of technological feasibility for all product development is based on the completion of a working model which has been approved for beta site testing 
historically costs incurred during beta site testing have not been material 
although the company presently expects costs to complete beta site testing in the future to be insignificant  as the company develops products to operate using other technologies as well as more comprehensive clinical systems  the time and effort required to complete beta site testing may be significantly more extensive 
consequently  capitalized software development costs may become material in future reporting periods

page cash flows from operations are principally comprised of net income and depreciation and are primarily affected by the net effect of the change in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
due to the nature of the company s business  accounts receivable  deferred revenue and accounts payable fluctuate considerably due to  among other things  the length of the sales cycle and installation efforts which are dependent upon the size of the transaction  the changing business plans of the customer  the effectiveness of customers management and general economic conditions 
in accounts receivable from customers have been collected on average within days 
this represents an increase of days in terms of average days to collect receivables from customers 
the increase is attributable to company s implementation of a new billing system and unbilled receivables related to contracts accounted for using long term contract accounting

new accounting standards in october   the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  revising certain aspects of sop no 
 which the company adopted on january  sop no 
did not materially affect the company s revenue recognition policies with respect to software license fees which are based upon objective evidence that is specific to the vendor and relate principally to its proprietary systems software which generally requires no significant production  modification or customization 
license revenue  accordingly  is recognized upon delivery subject to specified milestones and dates 
the company periodically enters into certain long term contracts to which sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts is applied 
for these agreements  revenue is recognized under a percentage of completion basis as appropriate measures of completion for each contract are achieved 
page in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income which the company adopted on january  the adoption of this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 earnings per share  which the company adopted on december  sfas no 
replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share 
unlike primary earnings per share  basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options  warrants and convertible securities

in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective with the fiscal year ended december  sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to stockholders 
sfas no 
also establishes standards for related disclosures about major customers  products and services and geographic areas 
operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in making decisions how to allocate resources and assess performance 
the company views its operations and manages its business as principally one segment  healthcare information solutions that include software  hardware and related services 
substantially all of the company s operations are in the united states 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa issued statement of position sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop  which the company adopted as of december   requires the capitalization of certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software 
prior to the adoption of sop no 
 the company expensed all internal use software related costs as incurred 
the effect of adopting the sop was to increase net income for the year ended december  by million or per diluted share 
backlog at december   the company had total backlog of million  including million attributable to systems sales and million attributable to services 
systems sales backlog consists of fees due under signed contracts which have not yet been recognized as revenues 
service backlog represents contracted software maintenance services  installation fees  and remote computing services fees for a period of months 
at december   the company had total backlog of million including million attributable to systems sales and million attributable to services for multiple years of services 
service backlog represents contracted software maintenance services  installation fees  and remote computing services fees for a period of months or greater at december  of the total backlog of million  the company expects that million will not be fulfilled in the current fiscal year 
year introduction software applications that use only two digits to identify a year in the date field may fail or create errors in the year year issues 
the company has taken significant steps to address year issues 
the company s internally used computer equipment  software and devices with embedded technology including both information systems and non information systems together  internal use systems may fail to operate properly or as expected due to year issues 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of the company s operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  conduct communications  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition  computer software products sold  marketed  and supported by the company company software products and the products of third parties that are distributed by the company or others or may be necessary for operation of company software products third party products  may fail to operate properly or as expected due to year issues 
such failures could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of customers operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  conduct communications  treat patients  or engage in similar normal business activities 
further  products and services used by the company s customers  but not supplied by the company  could fail to operate properly or as page expected due to year issues 
customers efforts to plan for such events could result in the deferral  delay or cancellation by customers of current installations of and plans to purchase company software products 
state of readiness the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to address year issues with respect to internal use systems  company software products  and third party products 
the company has established working groups whose primary functions are to i develop and implement the company s definition of year readiness  ii assess internal use systems  third party products and company software products for year issues  iii monitor development  testing and remediation efforts with respect to company software products  iv monitor testing of company software products and third party products  v review customer preparations to implement year releases of company software products  vi monitor and coordinate the company s deployment plans and results with respect to year releases of company software products  vii monitor and coordinate contingency plans with respect to internal use systems  company software products and third party products  and viii provide centralization  accuracy and consistency of the company s communications regarding year issues 
the company has engaged independent experts to assist in its efforts with respect to year issues 
the company has employed such experts to independently evaluate and verify its methodologies and state of readiness 
in addition  the company has employed experts to independently evaluate and certain critical internal use systems 
although the company s efforts to address year issues do not fall precisely into sequential phases  generally these efforts are comprised of an assessment phase  a development phase only with respect to company software products  a deployment or remediation phase  a preliminary contingency planning phase  and a final stage contingency planning phase 
internal use systems 
based upon the company s assessment efforts to date  the company believes that certain internal use systems will require replacement or modification  and to date the company has replaced or modified some internal use systems 
in addition  in the ordinary course of replacing and upgrading internal use systems  the company attempts to obtain replacements that it believes will not fail as a result of year issues 
the company has substantially completed its assessment efforts with respect to internal use systems and expects that its remediation efforts will be completed by the fourth quarter of the company is currently engaged in but has not completed contingency planning to address personnel  resource and technical year issues relating to foreseeable scenarios that may develop despite its current and planned remediation efforts 
the company estimates that as of december  it had completed approximately of its efforts in connection with year issues relating to its internal use systems 
the projects comprising the remaining of such efforts are in process and are expected to be substantially completed on or about the fourth quarter of the company has mailed letters or otherwise communicated with many of its significant vendors of internal use systems and related service providers to determine the extent to which year issues affect products and services of such vendors and providers 
as of march   the company had received responses from approximately of such third parties  and of these companies have provided written assurances that they expect to successfully address their significant year issues on a timely basis 
the company is engaged in but has not completed efforts to communicate with other vendors and service providers involved in its internal use systems to request more responses to its communications and to verify the responses received 
due to uncertainties associated with vendors and service providers  the company is unable to predict whether year issues involved in its internal use systems will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition  despite the company s current assessment to the contrary 
third party products 
the company works closely with vendors of significant third party products and has communicated with them to determine the extent to which their products and services are or will be year compliant 
in addition  the company is testing or plans to test year releases of certain third party products 
based upon its current assessment  the company believes it has received adequate assurances that significant third party product vendors expect to successfully address their significant year issues on a timely basis 
due to uncertainties associated with third party product vendors  the company is unable to predict whether a material adverse effect on business  results of operations  or financial condition may result from year issues related to third party products  despite the company s current assessment to the contrary 
page company software products 
the company began development of year versions of some company software products in and continues to progress through development cycles with respect to some company software products 
the company began deploying year releases of company software products in and expects to complete deployment of such releases during the second half of the company continues to test and monitor performance of year releases of company software products in customer environments 
the company expects to deliver and deploy maintenance releases of company software products in the ordinary course of business to remediate any year issues as identified during and after deployment of year releases of company software products 
based on the company s assessment  the company believes continuing efforts will be required to assist customers in deploying and testing year releases of company software products in their unique environments 
the company expects an increase in service and support effort levels as the year approaches and into the early months of the year the company develops  markets and supports many different products  and the amount of effort applied with respect to individual products varies from product to product 
the company estimates that as of december  it had completed approximately of the development efforts relating to year versions of all of the company software products 
the projects comprising the remaining of these efforts are in process and expected to be substantially completed in the third quarter of the company estimates that as of december   it had completed approximately of the deployment efforts relating to year versions of all company software products 
the projects comprising the remaining of these efforts are in process and are expected to be substantially completed in the third quarter of  but the company expects to continue efforts to remediate and maintain year versions of company software products in customer environments and to support customers efforts relating to year issues through the early part of the company is currently engaged in but has not completed contingency planning to address company wide personnel  resource  technical and communication issues relating to its service and remediation efforts 
the company expects that its development  remediation  testing  deployment and contingency planning efforts with respect to company software products will continue up to and beyond december   but expects the level of development and deployment will decrease in the second half of contingency plans and risks 
the company has begun  but not yet completed  a comprehensive analysis of the company wide operational  business and financial problems including possible loss of revenue  if any  that would be reasonably likely to result from the impact of unresolved year issues  including possible i failure by the company and vendors of third party products to complete efforts to avoid or minimize year issues on a timely basis  including failure of internal use systems  company software products and third party products to be year ready  ii failure of customers to be ready to or cooperate in the deployment of year ready versions of company software products and third party products on a timely basis  and iii delay  deferral or cancellation by customers of current installations and prospective purchase decisions with respect to company software products 
the company has not yet completed its contingency plans relating to year scenarios it deems sufficiently probable to merit contingency planning  but it has substantially completed its preliminary phase of contingency planning and expects to substantially complete its contingency planning by the third quarter of such contingency final stage planning will encompass worst case scenarios that assume the failure of significant communications and computing infrastructures of the company  its customers and suppliers  together with failures of governmental infrastructures affecting transportation 
costs the company estimates that the cost of its efforts to successfully address year issues will be approximately million  of which approximately million relates to internal use systems and million relates to company software products 
because the company develops  markets  and supports many different products  and the amount of effort applied with respect to individual products varies from product to product 
all expenditures to fund year issue efforts have been and will continue to be funded from operating expenditures for fiscal years through early  except for 
million  which is expected to be incurred and capitalized in as of december   the company had incurred approximately million related to its year issue assessment  remediation  testing  and contingency planning efforts identification  which is approximately of the total projected costs of such efforts 
of the amount of costs incurred to date  approximately million relates to internal use systems  which is approximately of the total of estimated costs for such efforts  and million relates to company software products  which is approximately of the total of estimated costs for such efforts 
unless all material year issues are timely and properly identified  assessed  and remediated  and unless adequate contingency plans are properly formulated  year issues may materially adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  page suppliers or others 
the company believes that year issues could cause failures in important elements of the computing and communications infrastructures of the company  its customers and suppliers and also company software products and third party products 
further  the company expects that it and its customers and suppliers may experience failures of such systems the causes of which will be difficult to determine  requiring the application of resources for diagnostic purposes 
if the company has not developed adequate contingency plans and means to address such contingencies  year issues issues will materially adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  suppliers or others 
the costs  timing and scheduling of deployment and installation of year versions of company software products and third party products  as well as the ability of the company to assist customers in the installation of company software products  will depend in part on the readiness  ability and cooperation of customers and their suppliers 
due to uncertainties associated with customers readiness  cooperation and sources of products and services  there can be no assurance that year issues will not materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition  or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors or others 
some customers and prospects of the company operate in complex computing environments that include products and services not supplied by the company 
the costs  timing and scheduling by customers of work related to year issues involving such products and services may cause some customers and prospects to defer current projects or prospective purchase decisions regarding company software products 
if year issues cause customers and prospects to defer current projects or prospective purchase decisions  the company s financial  business and operational goals may be deferred or may not be realized at all  with the result that the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
due to uncertainties associated with customers and prospects  there can be no assurance that year issues will not materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors or others 
the costs of the company s year identification  assessment  remediation  testing  deployment and contingency planning efforts  and the dates on which the company believes it will complete such efforts  are based upon management s current best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of and cost of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to correctly and effectively identify  assess  remediate  and test all relevant computer codes  equipment  and embedded technology  and similar uncertainties  the ability of the company to timely install and deploy year releases of company software products  a failure of the company to provide  obtain or make available adequate resources to assist customers in installing year releases of company software products and third party products 
as a result of any of such factors alone or in combination  the company may experience an increase in warranty and other claims 
in addition  since there is no uniform definition of compliance with year  and since the company sells a myriad of different combinations of products and services under varying contractual terms  the company is not able to assess or estimate the possible impact of such possible claims 
no assurance can be given that the aggregate cost of defending and resolving such claims  if any  will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
although some of the company s agreements with manufacturers and others from whom it purchases products for resale contain provisions requiring such parties to indemnify the company under some circumstances  there can be no assurance that such indemnification arrangements will cover all of the company s liabilities and costs relate to claims by third parties related to year issues 
factors affecting future results idx stock prices may continue to be volatile 
idx has experienced  and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its stock price due to a variety of factors including 
delay in customers purchasing decisions due to a variety of factors such as consolidation  management changes and year problems  
market prices of competitors such as mckesson hboc  inc  page 
announcements of technological innovations  including internet delivery of information and use of relational database technology  
new product introductions by idx or its competitors  
market conditions particularly in the computer software and hardware industries  and 
healthcare reform measures 
these fluctuations could have a significant impact on future market prices of idx s common stock 
on march  idx announced that it expected a loss of per share in the quarter ending march  following this announcement  the idx share price declined 
on march  the last reported sale price of idx common stock was on the nasdaq national market was per share 
on december   the last reported sale price of idx common stock on the nasdaq national market was 
this represents a decline in the value of idx stock since december  adverse financial trends including declining net income and cash from operations have and may continue 
year over year net income and cash from operations have declined since idx s net income was million in net income fell to million in and million in net income increased to million in cash from operations was million in  million in  and million in on march  idx announced that based on currently available information  the after tax loss for the first quarter ending march  is expected to be to million 
if these negative trends were to continue  idx would have difficulty in financing future growth and funding its operating initiatives including future acquisitions 
idx expects its quarterly operating results to fluctuate and its customer sales and installation requirements to change 
idx expects its quarterly results of operations to continue to fluctuate 
because a significant percentage of idx s expenses are relatively fixed  the following factors could cause these fluctuations 
delay in customers purchasing decisions due to a variety of factors such as consolidation  management changes and year problems  
the volume and timing of systems sales and installations  
recognizing revenue at various points during the installation process  and 
the sales and implementation cycles of idx s customers 
in addition  the timing of new product and service introductions and product upgrade releases and general economic conditions can impact idx s quarterly operating results 
in light of the above  idx believes that its results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful or reliable indicators of future performance 
future period to period fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on idx s results of operations  financial condition or business 
idx may experience challenges and incur substantial costs in integrating the operations of phamis  inc and edix 
since the acquisition in july  the integration of the operations and management of idx and phamis has and will continue to 
be a time consuming process  particularly in regard to coordinating product development and organizing customer support operations  
require continued dedication of management resources  which has and may continue to temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of the combined entity  and 
cause idx to incur significant merger and related costs including additional unanticipated expenses 
idx cannot assure you that it will complete this integration smoothly or successfully 
page edix will present idx operational challenges  particularly in the area of sales coordination 
in addition  idx expects to incur significant pre tax charges in association with the merger 
if idx fails to successfully integrate the operations or management of the two companies  it could have a material adverse effect on the combined entity s results of operations  financial condition or business 
idx may not be successful in implementing its acquisition strategy 
idx intends to continue to grow in part through either acquisitions of complementary products  technologies and businesses or alliances with complementary businesses 
idx may not be successful in these acquisitions or alliances  or in integrating any such acquired or aligned products  technologies or businesses into its current business and operations 
factors which may affect idx s ability to expand successfully include 
the successful identification and acquisition of products  technologies or businesses  
effective integration and operation of the acquired or aligned products  technologies or businesses despite technical difficulties  geographic limitations and personnel issues  and 
overcoming significant competition for acquisition and alliance opportunities from companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources  such as mckesson hboc  inc and shared medical systems corporation 
the failure to successfully integrate any significant products  technologies or businesses could have a material adverse effect on idx s results of operations  financial condition or business 
idx s success depends on new product development and its ability to respond to rapidly changing technology 
to be successful  idx must enhance its existing products  respond effectively to technology changes and help its clients adopt new technologies 
in addition  idx must sell additional products to its existing client base and introduce new products and technologies to meet the evolving needs of its clients in the healthcare information systems market 
idx may have difficulty in accomplishing this because of factors including 
evolving industry standards  for example  health level seven  
new technological developments  for example  the web technology 
idx is currently devoting significant resources toward the development of enhancements to its existing products  particularly in the announced area of web based functionality and the migration of existing products to new hardware and software platforms including relational database technology and object oriented programming 
however  idx may not successfully complete these product developments or the adaptation in a timely fashion  and idx s current or future products may not satisfy the needs of the healthcare information systems market 
any of these developments may adversely affect idx s competitive position or render its products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
idx may be adversely affected by year problems 
in the year software applications that use only two digits to identify a year in the date field may fail or create errors 
idx uses computer equipment  software and devices with embedded technology  including both information systems and non information systems  that may not be year compliant despite idx s continuing efforts to assess  remediate  and test such equipment  software and devices 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of idx s operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to 
process transactions  
send invoices  
conduct communications  or 
engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition  idx sells computer software products and distributes the products of third parties that may not be year compliant despite idx s continuing efforts to assess and test these products 
this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of customers operations  including  in addition to the types of disruptions described page above  a temporary disruption in their ability to treat patients 
further  products and services used by idx s customers  but not supplied by idx  may not be year compliant 
customers may defer current installations of and plans to purchase idx products until they have completed their own year assessment 
any of these problems could have a material adverse effect on idx s results of operations  financial condition or business 
idx does not believe that the year issues will pose significant operational problems for idx 
however  if year issues are not properly identified  assessed and resolved  it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial condition or business of idx 
in addition if actual year remediation costs are higher than idx estimated costs  it could materially adversely affect idx s results of operations  financial condition or business 
the nature of idx s business and its relationships with its customers make it difficult to assess the magnitude of idx s potential exposure as a result of year issues 
idx is engaged in the business of developing  marketing and supporting computer software 
idx s software is often used by its customers in conjunction with other vendors products and services 
the ability of idx to assist its customers in the development and installation of year compliant versions of idx software products will depend in part on the readiness  ability and cooperation of its customers and their suppliers 
in addition  the purchasing patterns of idx customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues 
the cost  timing and scheduling by customers of work related to year issues involving idx s products and services may cause some customers to defer or forego projects or purchase decisions 
idx sells a number of different combinations of products and services under varying contractual terms 
there is no widely accepted definition of year compliance 
certain of idx s customers may assert breach of warranty or other claims against idx relating to year compliance 
any of these factors may adversely affect the results of operations 
product sales within the healthcare industry may decline causing idx to suffer financially 
idx currently derives substantially all of its revenues from sales of financial  administrative and clinical healthcare information systems and related services within the healthcare industry 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting this industry and these sales could have a material adverse effect on idx 
in addition  even though idx s annual sales have increased  future revenues associated with existing products may decline as a result of factors like price competition 
idx may not be able to continue its success in marketing its current  new or enhanced products 
moreover  idx may be unable to maintain its current pricing for existing products 
idx may be faced with product liability claims exceeding its insurance coverage 
any failure by idx s products that provide applications relating to patient medical histories and treatment plans could expose idx to product liability claims 
these potential claims may exceed idx s current insurance coverage 
a successful claim brought against idx in excess of its insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on idx s results of operations 
even unsuccessful claims could be costly to defend and divert management time and resources 
in addition  idx cannot assure you that it will continue to have appropriate insurance available to it in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
idx s success is significantly dependent on key personnel 
the success of idx is dependent to a significant degree on its key management  sales  marketing  and technical personnel 
to be successful idx must attract  motivate and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel  including programmers  consultants  systems architects skilled in the technical environments in which idx s products operate 
competition for such personnel in the software and information services industries is intense 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on idx s results of operations 
idx does not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of its executives 
not all idx personnel have executed noncompetition agreements 
idx may be adversely affected by changes in the healthcare industry and by government healthcare reform proposals 
idx s products are designed to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of governmental regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates and capital expenditures 
from time to time  congress has considered proposals to reform the healthcare system 
if enacted  these proposals may increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the operating environment for idx s clients 
healthcare organizations may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for idx s products and services 
idx cannot predict with any certainty what impact these proposals or healthcare reforms might have on its results of operations  financial condition or business 
governmental regulation may impose new burdens and costs on idx s operations 
the united states food and drug administration has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the medical device amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
to the extent that computer software page is a medical device under the policy  idx  as a manufacturer of such products  could be required  depending on the product  to 
register and list its products with the fda  
notify the fda and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on the market before marketing such products  or 
obtain fda approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing a product 
depending on the intended use of a device  the fda could require idx to obtain extensive data from clinical studies to demonstrate safety or effectiveness  or substantial equivalence 
if the fda requires this data  idx would be required to obtain approval of an investigational device exemption before undertaking clinical trials 
clinical trials can take extended periods of time to complete 
idx cannot provide assurances you that the fda will approve or clear a device after the completion of such trials 
in addition  these products would be subject to the fdc act s general controls  including those relating to good manufacturing practices and adverse experience reporting 
although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of the fda s policy with regard to computer software  idx expects that the fda is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings regardless of whether the draft is finalized or changed 
the fda can impose extensive requirements governing pre and post market conditions like service investigation  approval  labeling and manufacturing 
in addition  the fda can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes 
in order to ensure continued compliance with changing government standards and regulations  idx monitors regulations affecting its business including those mandated by the health insurance portability and accountability act of idx may have conflicts of interests with some of its executives which may adversely affect idx 
richard e 
tarrant  president  chief executive officer and director  and robert h 
hoehl  chairman of the board of directors  indirectly own  through various entities  real estate which idx leases in connection with its operations 
during  idx paid an aggregate of approximately million in connection with these leases 
in november  idx announced tentative plans to expand one of its facilities located on land owned by these executives 
in connection with these arrangements  the economic interests of these executives and directors and idx may diverge 
in response  idx has created the committee on independent director transactions to review and approve transactions of this nature 
idx believes that these arrangements were entered into on an arm s length basis on terms that were no less favorable to idx than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results
