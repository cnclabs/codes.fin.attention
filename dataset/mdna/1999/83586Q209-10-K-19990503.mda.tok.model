a weakened asian economy and the loss of their largest customer caused sales of our wireless segment formally known as our fed operations to decline by million over fiscal sales to this customer were million and million for fiscal and fiscal sales by our network access segment also declined by million over fiscal as shipments of legacy products decreased 
sales for our optical networking segment increased by million over fiscal shipments of our gigamux family of products accounted for this increase 
sales for netsilicon increased by million over fiscal shipments were made to oem customers during fiscal compared to seven oem customers in fiscal contributing to this sales increase 
gross margins increased to from for the twelve months ended january  compared to the same period ended january  the higher gross margin of our gigamux products accounted for the increase in gross margin to from during fiscal over fiscal of our optical networking segment 
in addition  shipments of higher margin products by our wireless segment increased gross margin to during fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margin for netsilicon decreased to compared to from the prior year 
late delivery of the net arm chip and the slower than expected realization of general raw material cost reductions resulted in this gross margin decline

selling and marketing expenses increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  selling and marketing expenses represented of net sales compared to of net sales in fiscal our wireless segment incurred external commissions in fiscal of million on million in sales of our caller id device to a us based rboc 
this spending reduction partially offset the increase in external commissions 
engineering  research and development expenses increased to million or of net sales during fiscal from million or of net sales in fiscal this resulted in a increase in research and development costs over the prior year 
continued research and development efforts in the gigamux product family for our optical networking segment  the ixq remote access server in our network access segment and the net family of products in netsilicon  partially offset by a million decrease in these expenditures capitalized from and was the cause for the increased spending 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal a significant amount of this decrease was due to our wireless segment recording approximately million of additional reserves against their accounts receivable during fiscal compared to fiscal our optical networking segment  in preparing for expected growth of our gigamux products  incurred the additional expenses to build the infrastructure domestically  in europe and asia to adequately prepare for the expected business growth

see notes a and b to the financial statements contained in part ii herein 
certain of our products  primarily lan related items  were not competitive in the market for such products as the technology desired by customers could not be cost effectively added to such products 
we re aligned our resources to focus on providing products that address both the convergence of enterprise data networks and access networks on a cost effective basis  and the flexibility desired by customers 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against purchased technology and capitalized software that had no future alternative use 
purchased technology related to sciteq with a net book value of million at january  and is estimated to be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows from the acquired operation 
integration costs included the physical relocation of the santa barbara  california operations  consolidation of the san diego  california operations  and personnel relocation and reduction costs million 
interest expense net of other income was million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the interest expense is attributed primarily to short term borrowings against our lines of credit and  remained relatively constant compared with the prior year 
during fiscal  the interest expense was offset by a gain on disposal of assets by our wireless segment for property sold in hong kong 
there was no provision for income taxes for the year ended january  as compared to  for the year ended january  the tax provision for the fiscal year was the result of the profitable operations of our wireless segment for the fiscal year 
we have carry forwards of domestic federal net perating losses  which may be available  in part  to reduce future taxable income in the united states

results of operations comparison of the years ended january  and january net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal increasing unit sales for our network access family of products was the primary reason for this increase over the prior year 
sales to our international customers increased to of total net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales growth in japan and the pacific rim countries approximated million of the international sales increase during fiscal weaker economic conditions may have an impact on future sales growth in these markets 
delays in government spending  a stronger dollar versus local currencies and slower adoption of networking technologies are factors that may impact the economy 
gross margins were of net sales during fiscal compared to in fiscal shipments of higher margin products were substantial enough to offset price fluctuations for component parts experienced during the recent past 
shifts in the revenue mix and launching of new products may increase gross margins in the future

year compliance the year issue refers generally to the problems that some software may have in determining the correct century for the year 
for example  software with date sensitive functions that is not year compliant may not be able to distinguish whether means or  which may result in failures or the creation of erroneous results 
during fiscal we commenced taking steps to address potential year problems  including i identifying the computer systems and products affected  ii contacting vendors and customers  iii determining the year compliance status of each of its systems and products  and iv implementing any necessary changes 
although we do not currently expect the year issue will be material to our systems or products  we could discover or fail to discover year issues in the course of our evaluation process that would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition if not properly addressed 
we have completed a review of our products and have ascertained that our products are year compliant 
we have tested software obtained from third parties that is incorporated into its products  and is seeking assurances from its vendors that their licensed software is year compliant 
futhermore  we are surveying all vendors requesting information concerning exposure to year problems and the results are not complete 
we expect to complete this process by september we have received representation from certain vendors  including some of our sole source vendors  as to the year compliance of their systems and products 
despite our testing and our current and potential customers  and assurances from the vendors of the software and hardware incorporated into the products  our products may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
known or unknown errors or defects in such products could severely disrupt the company s operations and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
our internal systems include both information technology it and non it systems 
we have completed an assessment of its material internal it and non it systems  including software and hardware technology 
to the extent we cannot test the technology  we seek assurances from such vendors that their systems are year compliant 
we are not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing our internal it and non it systems for the year  however  we may experience material unanticipated problems and costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal it and non it systems 
we intend to complete the remediation of any non year compliant technology by september we are surveying our customers requesting information concerning exposure to year problems and the results are not complete 
our current and potential customers may incur significant expense to achieve year compliance 
if such customers are not year compliant  they may incur material costs to remedy problems or face litigation costs 
as a result  such customers and potential customers could reduce or eliminate plans that they have to purchase our products or services 
such events could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the efforts to address the year issue has been funded from available cash and has not separately accounted for these costs in its financial statements 
the costs of addressing this issue is currently estimated to be approximately  but the final cost has not yet been determined  all costs  excluding third party vendor software upgrades costing  have been expensed as incurred 
we do not believe the risks of year compliance are material  therefore we have not yet established a contingency plan in the event that we or our customers or vendors cannot correct the year problem 
in the event that we or our customers or vendors cannot correct the year problem we will allocate the appropriate resources at that time 
however  we are subject to external forces that may affect industry and commerce generally  such as utility or transportation company year compliance failures and related service interruptions 
we believe we have sufficient working capital to meet its planned level of operations for fiscal however  there can be no assurance that our working capital requirements for fiscal will not exceed our ability to generate sufficient cash internally to support its requirements and the need capital will have to be obtained from external sources 
we cannot give any assurances that sufficient capital  at terms acceptable to us  will be available when needed 
effects of inflation and currency exchange rates we believes that the relatively moderate rate of inflation in the united states over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results or on the prices of raw materials 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future 
the majority of our are currently denominated in us dollars and to date our business has not been significantly affected by currency fluctuations 
however  we conduct business in several different countries and thus fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive in particular countries  leading to a reduction in sales in that country 
in addition  inflation in such countries could increase our expenses 
in the future  we may engage in foreign currency denominated sales or pay material amounts of expenses in foreign currencies and  in such event  may experience gains and losses due to currency fluctuations 
our operating results could be adversely affected by such fluctuations

other matters see item legal proceedings contained herein 
item a 
quanitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to minimal market risks 
sensitivity of results of operations to these risks is managed by maintaining a conservative investment portfolio  which is comprised solely of money market funds  and entering into long term debt obligations with appropriate price and term characteristics 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
investments held for other than trading purposes do not impose a material market risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk  as additional financing is periodically needed due to the large operating losses and capital expenditures associated with establishing and expanding our operations 
the interest rate that we will be able to obtain on debt financing will depend on market conditions at that time  and may differ from the rates the company has secured on its current debt 
additionally  the company is exposed to interest rate risk on amounts borrowed against its credit facilities at january  as the rates charged by lenders adjusts on the basis of the lenders prime rate
