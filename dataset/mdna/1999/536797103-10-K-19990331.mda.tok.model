liquidity and capital resources lithia s principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures and for working capital 
lithia has relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under its credit facilities and the proceeds from public equity offerings to finance its operations and expansion 
in may  lithia closed an offering of million newly issued shares of its class a common stock for net proceeds of million 
the proceeds were used to pay down lithia s lines of credit until needed for future acquisitions 
ford credit  toyota motor credit corporation  chrysler financial corporation and general motors acceptance corporation have agreed to floor all of lithia s new vehicles for their respective brands with ford serving as the primary lender for all other brands 
there are no formal limits to these commitments for new vehicle wholesale financing 
ford credit has also extended a million revolving line of credit for used vehicles and a million acquisition line of credit to purchase dealerships of any brand 
these commitments have an expiration date of november  with interest due monthly 
lithia has the right to elect to extend the term on these lines of credit for an additional two years at november  lithia also has the option to convert the acquisition line into a five year term loan on november  or november  in addition  us bank na has extended a million revolving line of credit for leased vehicles 
the lines with ford credit are cross collateralized and are secured by inventory  accounts receivable  intangible assets and equipment 
the other new vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the relevant dealerships 
the ford credit lines of credit contain financial covenants requiring lithia to maintain compliance with  among other things  specified ratios of i total debt to tangible base capital  ii total adjusted debt to tangible base capital  iii current ratio  iv fixed charge coverage  and v net cash 
lithia is currently in compliance with all such financial covenants 
the ford credit lines of credit agreements also preclude the payment of cash dividends without the prior consent of ford credit 
interest rates on all of the above facilities ranged from to at december  amounts outstanding on the lines at december  were as follows in thousands acquisition line used vehicle line  new and program vehicle lines  leased vehicle line  since december when lithia completed its initial public offering  it has acquired dealerships 
the aggregate net investment was approximately million excluding borrowings on its credit lines to finance acquired vehicle inventories and equipment and the purchase of any real estate 
lithia anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its cash requirements at least through december   including its currently anticipated growth  primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under available credit facilities and cash currently available 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  lithia s sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year largely due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance may be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the other quarters of each fiscal year 
management believes that interest rates  levels of consumer debt  consumer buying patterns and confidence  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
the timing of acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations of operating results from quarter to quarter 
year general 
lithia has identified three major areas of concern i the functionality of its internal systems and the company s ability to run its daily business after january   ii the visual representation of  and iii third party systems 
lithia expects to be year compliant by july  lithia is utilizing the nada dealer guide to assist in resolving its year issues and problems 
internal systems 
lithia is in the process of analyzing and updating its internal systems  including its dealer management systems  dealer communication systems  personal computer systems  shared port systems and phone systems 
lithia estimates that it is percent complete with implementing various manufacturer upgrades to its systems in order to make them year compliant 
we estimate that our internal systems we will be fully year compliant by july  like all businesses  lithia is at risk from external infrastructure failures that could arise from year failures 
it is not clear that electrical power  telephone and computer networks  for example  will be fully functional across the nation in the year investigation and assessment of infrastructures  like the nation s power grid  is beyond the scope and resources of lithia 
investors should use their own awareness of the issues in the nation s infrastructure to make ongoing infrastructure risk assessments and their potential impact to a company s performance 
visual representation 
lithia is currently working on ensuring that all report date stamps  timekeeping devices  etc 
are year compliant 
we estimate that we are approximately percent complete with this process 
third parties 
lithia has begun a year supplier audit program 
it has contacted all of its critical suppliers to inform them of its year expectations  and requests have been made for each vendor s compliance program and or year compliance assurance 
in regard to the automobile manufacturers  lithia has received written or other confirmation that they are year compliant  except for subaru 
subaru has assured lithia that they expect to be year compliant prior to january  it should be noted that there have been predictions of failures of key components in the transportation infrastructure due to the year problem 
it is possible that there could be delays in rail  over the road and air shipments due to failure in transportation control systems 
investigation and validation of the world s transportation infrastructure is beyond the scope and the resources of lithia 
investors should use their own awareness of the issues in the transportation infrastructure to make ongoing infrastructure risk assessments and their potential impact to a company s performance 
acquisitions 
acquisitions in will be subject to strict due diligence for year compliance 
cost 
lithia expects to incur costs totaling approximately  to ensure year compliance  approximately  of which has already been incurred since the end of a majority of the  represents replacement of non compliant systems  and therefore will be capitalized and amortized over a three to five year period 
this estimate could change depending on variances not anticipated in the initial bids 
risk 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect lithia s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers  lithia is unable to determine  at this time  whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
lithia s efforts to help ensure year preparedness have  and will continue to  significantly reduce its level of uncertainty about the year problem 
we believe that  with completion of the above mentioned plans  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
lithia is currently developing contingency plans in regard to its internal systems and supplier issues  as well as for the more global infrastructure issues 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for all derivative instruments 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  lithia does not have any derivative instruments and  accordingly  the adoption of sfas will have no impact on its financial position or results of operations
