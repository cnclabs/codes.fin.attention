item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview theragenics operates in one business segment  the development  manufacture and sale of radiological devices used in the treatment of cancer 
in  the company received clearance from the us food and drug administration fda for commercial distribution of theraseed r  a rice sized device  for use in any solid localized tumor 
currently  theraseed r is the company s principal product and is used primarily in the treatment of early stage prostate cancer 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  located primarily in the united states  utilize the theraseed r product 
in the company received regulatory approval for the marketing of theraseed r throughout the member countries of the european union by obtaining ce marking 
sales of theraseed r in europe were not significant in under a sales and marketing agreement executed in may with indigo medical  inc indigo  a johnson johnson company  the indigo agreement indigo obtained the exclusive worldwide right to market and sell theraseed r for the treatment of prostate cancer 
under the terms of the indigo agreement  indigo has responsibility for the education and training of urologists  radiation oncologists and other personnel involved in the use of theraseed r  as well as all other sales and marketing activities 
the company continues to be responsible for all manufacturing and distribution of theraseed r 
palladium pd is the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation of theraseed r 
prior to  the company relied exclusively on reactor produced pd in order to increase control over the timeliness  availability and cost of pd  the company converted from reactor produced pd to an alternative means of producing pd using a cyclotron 
the first cyclotron became operational in and as of december   seven cyclotrons were fully operational 
currently  all pd utilized by the company is produced by company owned cyclotrons 
the company s first cyclotron was installed in  one cyclotron was added annually in  and  and three cyclotrons became operational during six additional cyclotrons are scheduled to become operational in and one more in because a cyclotron does not become operational until approximately months after it is ordered  the accuracy of the company s long term projections related to delivery of cyclotrons and market conditions  such as demand  can significantly affect its results of operations 
the delivery of cyclotrons prior to a commensurate increase in demand could adversely impact gross margins  while inadequate capacity could limit the company s ability to meet demand and achieve maximum sales growth 
also  due to the highly sophisticated and technical nature of the equipment  the company has in the past encountered delays and difficulties in the construction  installation and testing of its cyclotrons 
management cannot be certain that such problems will not occur in connection with the construction  installation and testing of the cyclotrons to be installed in and in addition to adding three cyclotrons in  the company completed the construction of its new production facilities 
additional expansion plans currently underway and expected to be completed during include the addition of seven cyclotrons and supporting facilities  although one of the cyclotrons is not expected to be operational until early as of december   approximately million has been incurred in connection with these expansion plans and completion of the expansion is expected to cost an additional million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
this increase was attributable to the company s ability to increase production and sales volume of theraseed r with additional cyclotron and assembly capacity  including the addition of three cyclotrons in although was another year of record revenue for theragenics  sales for the fourth quarter of declined as compared to the third quarter of this was the first full quarter in which the transition of sales responsibility for theraseed r to indigo under the indigo agreement was substantially complete  as well as the first quarter in which the company had more capacity than current demand 
during indigo focused its marketing efforts on physician training and building physician relationships  rather than efforts directed at patients 
the company believes that the results of indigo s marketing efforts have confirmed theragenics experience that in addition to marketing theraseed r to physicians and other health care professionals  substantial attention and resources must be devoted to educating the ultimate consumer regarding the benefits of seeding therapy 
in recognition of the potential value added by consumer marketing and in an effort to build sales growth momentum  indigo has advised the company that it has made adjustments to its sales and marketing strategy to increase the focus on marketing efforts directed to patients 
theragenics management is working closely with indigo in the development of these marketing efforts 
looking forward  the full impact of marketing efforts directed to patients may not be realized for several months since a patient is typically not treated until six weeks to three months or more after being diagnosed with prostate cancer 
therefore  there are no assurances that sales for the first quarter of will increase or even remain flat versus the fourth quarter of management believes that indigo s patient directed marketing focus could have a positive impact on sales in the second half of  though there are no assurances that these efforts will not take longer to have an impact on revenue  if any 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated based on certain risks and uncertainties  such as the impact of indigo s marketing efforts to consumers and medical professionals 
management is confident in indigo s commitment of both talent and resources to its objective of making theraseed r the treatment of choice for prostate cancer 
licensing fees represent royalty payments with respect to the company s licensed therasphere r technology 
management does not expect such licensing fees to become material in the foreseeable future 
see note g to the financial statements 
cost of product sales increased to of product sales in from of product sales revenue in this increase was attributable to an increase in the manufacturing fixed cost base as depreciation and other fixed expenses associated with additional cyclotrons and new manufacturing facilities were incurred during as additional cyclotrons come on line  margins generally decline because each machine represents excess capacity for a period while carrying its full component of fixed costs  including depreciation 
with cyclotrons through expected to be brought on line in  cost of product sales are expected to continue to increase as a percent of revenue to the extent that additional cyclotrons create capacity more rapidly than the growth in demand 
during the company also increased the number of manufacturing employees and enhanced employee compensation and benefits in an effort to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
fiscal also included moving  training  testing and other start up expenses associated with its new manufacturing facilities  which were placed in service in the third quarter  and testing and start up expenses related to three cyclotrons 
only one cyclotron was added in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue over is also attributable to the fact that during the first half of  prior to the execution of the indigo agreement  the company sold and marketed theraseed r with internal resources and accordingly  charged higher unit prices than it has charged to indigo 
fiscal reflects a full year of these reduced unit prices  while the indigo agreement was in effect for only the last half of under the terms of the indigo agreement  indigo bears the selling and marketing expenses directly associated with theraseed r for prostate cancer 
accordingly  management does not expect indigo s marketing efforts to have a significant impact on the company s sg a expenses in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in compared to million in  reflecting an increase of million or 
however  sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to in from in the increase in sg a expenses during was primarily attributable to increases in professional fees and compensation and benefits 
legal and professional fees increased primarily due to fees in connection with the company s on going efforts to protect its trade secrets and other proprietary information  including litigation against parties the company believes have violated or threaten to violate the company s rights 
compensation and benefits increased as the company continued to add employees and build infrastructure to support its increasing operations 
the increase in sg a expenses in over were partially offset by a reduction in selling expenses as a result of the indigo agreement 
under the indigo agreement  indigo bears the cost of the selling and marketing efforts related to theraseed r for prostate cancer 
the decreases in these selling expenses contributed to the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue in from additionally  sg a expenses incurred to support increasing operations did not increase at the same rate as the growth in revenue 
selling and marketing related expenses are not expected to continue to decline however  since the indigo agreement became effective during the third quarter of research and development r d expenses were  in compared to  in the increase in r d was a result of development efforts to improve the company s proprietary production processes 
in connection with the company s efforts to enhance its production processes and its objective to expand the application of pd and theraseed r to other oncological and non oncological uses  management plans to significantly increase efforts and investment in research and development in with the possibility of expenditures in this area more than tripling 
r d spending is dependent on appropriate opportunities arising so no assurances can be made as to spending amounts 
as a result  r d expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
other income was approximately million for both and  comprised primarily of interest income generated from the company s short term investments and high quality municipal bond investments 
these investments were made utilizing the proceeds from the company s secondary stock offering in april these funds have and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs 
as funds continue to be used for expansion programs  management expects other income to decline accordingly 
income tax expense was million in and million in the increase was due to the increase in pretax earnings in over the effective income tax rate was for and year ended december  compared to year ended december  product sales were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
market acceptance of the company s theraseed r treatment alternative for prostate cancer grew during concurrently  the company was able to reliably increase production from its cyclotron based manufacturing and thereby take advantage of increased demand 
sales also reflect that the company had four cyclotrons available during much of to meet sales demand as compared to only two cyclotrons throughout licensing fees represent royalty payments with respect to the company s licensed therasphere r technology 
management does not expect licensing fees to become material in the foreseeable future 
see note g of notes to financial statements 
cost of product sales was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to incremental staffing and cyclotron related costs 
staffing increases were necessary to respond to and anticipate sales growth 
cyclotron operating costs and depreciation increased as all four of the company s cyclotrons were in service by february  as additional cyclotrons come on line  margins generally decline because each machine represents excess capacity for a period while carrying its full component of fixed costs  including depreciation 
as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in this decrease resulted from economies of scale 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
primary contributors to this increase were legal and professional fees and compensation and related expense 
legal and professional expense fees increased as the company completed the theragenics indigo sales and marketing agreement and initiated legal action against a small company founded by former employees 
compensation and related expenses rose as the number of employees increased and salaries were increased reflecting the larger scope of the company s operations and the need to attract and retain qualified employees 
there were also higher expenditures in a number of areas representing support for higher sales levels 
despite these increases  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in due to economies of scale 
the company had no ongoing research function in and as in the past  much of the development component of research and development of product and processes is incorporated in the manufacturing area and therefore is included in the cost of goods sold category 
other income expense during the periods presented consist principally of interest income  interest expense and the write off of unamortized loan costs as a result of loan refinancing 
interest income jumped dramatically in  reflecting interest on funds received as a result of the secondary stock offering completed in april  since these funds will largely be used to fund the company s expansion program in and  management expects other income to return to levels consistent with historical amounts 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately in and approximately in the decline in the effective tax rate was due to tax exempt interest earned in liquidity and capital resources the company s principal cash needs related to capital spending to increase manufacturing capacity 
the company has funded its capital expansion programs with cash generated from operations and the proceeds of a secondary stock offering that was completed in april the company had cash and short term investments of million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and short term investments was a result of cash used for capital expenditures  partially offset by cash generated from operations 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily a result of the decline in cash and short term investments  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
cash provided by operations was million and million in and  respectively 
cash generated from operations consists of net earnings plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  and the effects of cash either absorbed or generated by changes in working capital 
cash provided by operations declined in from as cash generated from the increase in net earnings was offset primarily by an increase in accounts receivable and decrease in accounts payable 
cash used by investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively  and are expected to significantly increase in these expenditures relate primarily to capital expansion projects including the addition of cyclotrons and new manufacturing and support facilities 
capital expenditures during primarily represented phase i of an expansion project to add four cyclotrons and new manufacturing and support facilities 
during  the company completed the construction of the new manufacturing and support facilities and three of the cyclotrons became operational  bringing the total number of fully operational cyclotrons to seven 
the phase i expansion was completed during the first quarter of with the addition of cyclotron number eight 
additional expansion projects currently underway include purchase agreements to add six additional cyclotrons and supporting facilities during  although one of these cyclotrons will not be fully installed and operational until early costs incurred through december  on these projects were approximately million 
these projects are expected to cost approximately million and be completed in various stages during upon completion of these projects  the company expects to have fourteen fully operational cyclotrons with supporting facilities 
investing activities also included cash generated from net maturities of marketable securities of million in  and the purchase of marketable securities of million in marketable securities consist primarily of high credit quality municipal debt obligations purchased in accordance with the company s investment policies 
cash provided by financing activities was  in  consisting of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
during  cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting primarily of million in net proceeds from a secondary stock offering and million from the sale of common stock to johnson and johnson development company  an affiliate of indigo 
financing activities in also included the repayment of million of long term debt and  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
management believes that current cash and investment balances  cash from future operations and its available credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet its currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
in the event additional financing becomes necessary  management may choose to raise those funds through other means of financing as appropriate 
foreign currency and geographic information as previously noted  the company expects that its capital expansion projects currently underway will cost approximately million  of which approximately million has been incurred as of december  of the million in purchase commitments related to the completion of these projects  approximately million is denominated in belgian francs  based on the year end exchange rate 
this exposes the company to foreign currency risk as it relates to movements in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the belgian franc 
the company manages this risk by frequently reviewing the status of the purchase commitments and entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risks when believed it is appropriate to do so 
such forward contracts typically mature concurrently with payments required under the equipment purchase contracts 
the company does not hold foreign exchange forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   the company did not hold any foreign exchange forward contracts 
additionally  management does not expect the introduction of the euro to have any effect on its purchase commitments denominated in belgian francs 
the terms of the purchase agreements allow for all payments to be made in belgian francs 
all balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the year end rate of exchange 
such balance sheet accounts  which were not significant at december   included a cash account maintained in belgium and denominated in belgian francs 
additionally  there were no statements of earnings items or any foreign currency transaction gains or losses during any of the three years in the period ended december  included in construction in progress at december  are progress payments totaling approximately million related to equipment being constructed in belgium 
upon completion of construction  the equipment will be transported to the united states and installed in the company s us manufacturing facilities 
impact of the year issue introduction many computer systems used today were designed and developed using two digits  rather than four  to specify the year 
consequently  such systems may recognize a date of as the year instead of the year other problems may also be encountered  such as the inability to recognize special codes that make use of the date field 
these and other problems may exist in primary software products and embedded systems such as microcontrollers 
this may cause many computer systems to fail or create inaccurate results unless corrective measures are taken 
additionally  a company may be affected by the computer systems of their customers and vendors  even though that company s internal computer systems may be year yk compliant 
state of readiness the company began to assess the status of its yk readiness during and developed a plan intended to make its information technology assets  including embedded microcontrollers it assets  year ready 
the plan covers the following phases i inventory of it assets  ii assessment of repair requirements iii repair and testing  and iv creation of contingency plans in the event of yk related failures 
the inventory and assessment phases have been completed for all critical it assets 
repairs and testing of critical it assets is currently in process and is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of the company s yk compliance also depends upon the compliance of others 
the company has contacted its critical suppliers and significant customer to evaluate their yk programs and state of readiness  and to evaluate whether a yk related disruption at these entities would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations as the year approaches 
at the current date  the company has received responses from approximately of the entities contacted  none of which have indicated that a year related business interruption is anticipated 
however  while the company believes it is taking reasonable action in this regard  theragenics is not in a position to guarantee the performance of others or predict whether any assurances and representations received from others will ultimately prove to be accurate 
additionally  the yk compliance of the company s critical suppliers and significant customer also depends upon the yk compliance of their critical suppliers and customers 
the company also relies on governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunication service providers  financial institutions and other service providers outside of the company s control 
there is no assurance that any of these entities will not experience a year related failure and business interruption 
such failures could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
costs to address the year issue the company has incurred costs of approximately  in addressing the yk issue  consisting primarily of replacing it assets that were not yk compliant 
remaining costs of yk remediation are not expected to be material 
risks of the company s year issues the company has not currently identified any critical it assets under its control that present a material risk of not being yk compliant in a timely manner  or for which an acceptable alternative cannot be implemented 
as testing continues however  it is possible that it assets could be identified that present a material risk of a yk interruption  and that such an interruption could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company does not possess the ability to control its critical suppliers  significant customer or the health care providers that utilize its product 
yk related disruptions at these entities could result in delays in the supply of goods and services and capital equipment from the company s vendors  delays in receiving payments from the company s significant customer  and delays in the ordering of product and scheduling of theraseed r procedures by the health care providers  among other things 
such potential delays could be of a short term nature or could be more significant and longer term 
the failure of any of these entities to properly address their year issues could have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
additionally  the failure of the company s primary equipment vendor to deliver cyclotrons in accordance with the terms of the purchase contracts could have a materially adverse effect on the company s ability to increase its production capacity 
contingency plans contingency plans for critical it assets are currently being developed 
these contingency plans are in the early stages of development and will be modified as the risks of potential yk interruptions continue to be assessed
