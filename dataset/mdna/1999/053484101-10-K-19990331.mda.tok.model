the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
general the company is a real estate investment trust reit that is focused on the ownership and operation of institutional quality apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
these markets are located in northern and southern california and selected states in the mid atlantic  northeast  midwest and pacific northwest regions of the country 
the company is the surviving corporation from the merger the merger of avalon properties  inc avalon with and into the company sometimes hereinafter referred to as bay before the merger on june  the merger was accounted for as a purchase of avalon by bay 
in conjunction with the merger  the company changed its name from bay apartment communities  inc to avalonbay communities  inc 
the company is a fully integrated real estate organization with in house acquisition  development  redevelopment  construction  reconstruction  financing  marketing  leasing and management expertise 
with its experience and in house capabilities  the company believes it is well positioned to continue to pursue opportunities to develop and acquire upscale apartment homes in its target markets  although the company may be constrained by the need to access cost effective capital to finance this activity 
the company s real estate investments as of march  consist primarily of apartment communities in various stages of the development cycle and land or land options held for development 
such investments can be divided into three categories number of number of communities apartment homes current communities  development communities  development rights  represents an estimate current communities are apartment communities where construction is complete and the community has either reached stabilized occupancy or is in the initial lease up process or under redevelopment 
current communities include the following sub classifications stabilized communities 
represents all current communities that have completed initial lease up by attaining physical occupancy levels of at least or have been completed for one year  whichever occurs earlier 
for evaluation purposes  the company regards each stabilized community as falling into one of three categories west coast established communities 
represents all stabilized communities owned by bay as of january   with stabilized operating costs as of january  such that a comparison of operating results to operating results is meaningful 
as of march   there were west coast established communities containing  apartment homes 
when used in connection with a comparison of and results  the term established communities refers to communities that were stabilized as of january  east coast established communities 
represents all stabilized communities owned by avalon as of january  and subsequently acquired by the company in connection with the merger  with stabilized operating costs as of january  such that a comparison of operating results to operating results is meaningful 
as of march   there were east coast established communities containing  apartment homes 
other stabilized communities 
represents stabilized communities as defined above  but which attained such classification or were acquired after january  as of march   there were other stabilized communities containing  apartment homes 
lease up communities 
represents all current communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and the communities are in the initial lease up process 
as of march   there was one lease up community containing apartment homes 
redevelopment communities 
represents all current communities where substantial redevelopment has either begun or is scheduled to begin 
redevelopment is considered substantial when additional capital invested during the reconstruction effort exceeds the lesser of million or of the community s acquisition cost 
as of march   there were redevelopment communities containing  apartment homes 
development communities are communities that are under construction and may be partially complete and operating and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received 
development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which the company has an option to acquire land or owns land to develop a new community and where related pre development costs have been incurred and capitalized in pursuit of these new developments 
of the current communities  the company holds a fee simple ownership interest in operating communities one of which is on land subject to a year land lease  a general partnership interest in four partnerships that hold a fee simple interest in four other operating communities  a general partnership interest in four partnerships structured as downreits as described more fully below that own communities  and a interest in a senior participating mortgage note secured by one community 
the company holds a fee simple ownership interest in each of the development communities except for two communities that are owned by partnerships in which the company holds a general partnership interest 
in each of the four partnerships structured as downreits  the company is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is denominated in units of limited partnership interest units 
for each downreit partnership  limited partners who hold units are entitled to receive certain distributions a stated distribution prior to any distribution that such downreit partnership makes to the general partner 
the stated distributions that are paid in respect of the downreit units currently approximate the dividend rate applicable to common stock of the company 
each downreit partnership has been structured in a manner that makes it unlikely that the limited partners thereof will be entitled to any greater distribution than the stated distribution 
each holder of units has the right to require the downreit partnership that issued a unit to redeem that unit at a cash price equal to the then fair market value of a share of common stock of the company  except that the company has the right to acquire any unit so presented for redemption for one share of common stock 
as of march   there were  units outstanding 
the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
the company s management management believes apartment communities present an attractive investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base results in relatively stable demand during all phases of a real estate cycle 
the company intends to pursue appropriate new investments both acquisitions of communities and new developments in markets where constraints to new supply exist and where new household formations have out paced multifamily permit activity in recent years 
at december   management had positioned the company s portfolio of stabilized communities  excluding communities owned by joint ventures  to an average physical occupancy level of and achieved an average economic occupancy of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this continued high occupancy was achieved through aggressive marketing efforts combined with limited and targeted pricing adjustments 
this positioning has resulted in overall growth in rental revenue from established communities between periods 
it is management s strategy to maximize total rental revenue through management of rental rates and occupancy levels 
if market and economic conditions change  management s strategy of maximizing total rental revenue could lead to lower occupancy levels 
given the high occupancy level of the portfolio  management anticipates that any rental revenue and net income gains from the company s established communities would be achieved primarily through higher rental rates and enhanced operating cost leverage provided by high occupancy 
the company elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes for the year ended december  and has not revoked that election 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of california in and was reincorporated in the state of maryland in july its principal executive offices are located at eisenhower avenue  suite  alexandria  virginia  and its telephone number at that location is the company also maintains super regional offices in san jose  california and wilton  connecticut and acquisition  development  redevelopment  construction  reconstruction or administrative offices in or near boston  massachusetts  chicago  illinois  minneapolis  minnesota  new york  new york  newport beach  california  princeton  new jersey  richmond  virginia  and seattle  washington 
recent developments sales of existing communities 
during  the company completed a strategic planning effort resulting in a decision to pursue a disposition strategy for certain assets in markets that did not meet its long term strategic direction 
in connection with this disposition strategy  during the company sold seven communities  totaling  apartment homes 
net proceeds from the sale of these communities totaled million resulting in a net gain of million 
the proceeds from the sale of these communities will be directed to the development and redevelopment of communities currently under construction or reconstruction 
in connection with an agreement executed by avalon in march which provided for the buyout of certain limited partners in downreit v limited partnership  the company sold two communities in july net proceeds from the sale of the two communities  containing an aggregate of apartment homes  were approximately million 
special meeting of stockholders 
on october   the company held a special meeting of stockholders at which stockholders approved i amendments to the charter reducing the number of authorized shares of the company s common stock from  to  and ii an amendment to the charter changing the company s name from avalon bay communities  inc to avalonbay communities  inc preferred offering

organizational changes 
in february  the company announced certain management changes 
the management changes included the departures of charles h 
berman  the company s president  chief operating officer and a director  jeffrey b 
van horn  senior vice president investments  and max l 
gardner  senior vice president development acquisitions 
other announced management changes included the promotion of bryce blair  then senior vice president development acquisitions  to chief operating officer  and the promotion of robert h 
slater  then senior vice president property operations  to executive vice president 
messrs 
berman  gardner and van horn are entitled to severance benefits in accordance with the terms of their employment agreements with the company dated as of march  the company expects to record a non recurring charge in the first quarter of relating to this management realignment and certain related organizational adjustments 
because a complete plan of management realignment was not in existence on june   the date of the company s merger with avalon  this charge is not considered a part of the company s purchase price for avalon and  accordingly  the expenses associated with the management realignment will be treated as a non recurring charge 
management and the terminated officers are currently determining the amount of severance that each terminated officer is entitled to receive pursuant to their employment agreements and the valuations  if any  that must be performed pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements 
management is also completing an evaluation of the additional charge related to the other organizational changes 
however  management currently estimates that the non recurring charge that will be incurred in connection with these organizational adjustments  including severance payments and contract termination costs  costs to relocate accounting functions and office space reductions  will be approximately million 
the recurring cost reductions associated with the organizational adjustments giving rise to such non recurring charge are estimated by management to total approximately million annually which estimate does not include any value assigned to the probable annual grants of stock options that would have been made to the terminated officers 
no assurance can be given as to the amount of such non recurring charge or the amount of the recurring cost reductions which could arise therefrom which could be greater or less than the estimates provided 
results of operations the changes in operating results from period to period on a historical basis are primarily the result of increases in the number of apartment homes owned due to the merger as well as the development and acquisition of additional communities 
where appropriate  comparisons are made on a weighted average basis for the number of occupied apartment homes in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes 
for stabilized communities excluding communities owned by joint ventures  all occupied apartment homes are included in the calculation of weighted average occupied apartment homes for each reporting period 
for communities in the initial lease up phase  only apartment homes of communities that are completed and occupied are included in the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes calculation for each reporting period 
comparisons are also made between west and east coast established communities for rental income  operating expenses and property taxes 
east coast established communities are compared on a pro forma basis for the years ended december  and  as if the merger had occurred as of january  management closely reviews these results as an indication of market strength and the effectiveness with which the communities are operated 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net income increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase is additional operating income from the communities owned by avalon prior to the merger 
the increase is also attributable to additional operating income from communities developed or acquired during and  as well as growth in operating income from west coast established communities 
rental income increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  of the increase   relates to rental revenue increases from west coast established communities   relates to rental revenue attributable to the former avalon communities and  is attributable to the addition of newly completed or acquired apartment homes 
overall portfolio the  increase is primarily due to increases in the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes as well as an increase in the weighted average monthly rental income per occupied apartment home 
the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased from  apartment homes for the year ended december  to  apartment homes for the year ended december  as a result of additional apartment homes from the former avalon communities and the development and acquisition of new communities 
for the year ended december   the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  compared to  for the year ended december  west coast established communities rental revenue increased  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year due to market conditions that allowed for higher average rents  but lower economic occupancy levels 
for the year ended december   weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  compared to  for the preceding year 
the average economic occupancy decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the company s west coast established communities consist entirely of communities located within the northern california market 
compared to the prior year  most of the sub markets within northern california where the company s communities are located have maintained a strong economic environment that has allowed for high occupancy levels and rent growth 
however  management believes that  beginning in october  certain northern california sub markets that are primarily dependent on silicon valley employment have softened  in part due to asian economic difficulties 
these impacted sub markets have experienced reduced rent growth and occupancy compared to other northern california sub markets 
east coast established communities rental revenue on a pro forma basis increased  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year due to market conditions that allowed for higher average rents at higher economic occupancy levels 
for the year ended december   weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to compared to for the preceding year

west coast established communities operating expenses for the west coast established communities increased  
to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the preceding year 
the net change is the result of higher payroll and maintenance costs  offset by lower utility  administrative and insurance costs 
lower insurance costs are directly attributable to better pricing and risk sharing provided by the merger with avalon 
east coast established communities operating expenses for the east coast established communities on a pro forma basis increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the preceding year 
the net change is the result of higher payroll and maintenance costs  offset by lower utility and insurance costs 
lower insurance costs are also attributable to the merger due to better pricing

overall portfolio the increase in property taxes is primarily due to additional expense from the former avalon communities and secondarily due to the addition of newly developed  redeveloped or acquired apartment homes 
property taxes on development and redevelopment communities are expensed as communities move from the initial construction and lease up phase to the stabilized operating phase 
west coast established communities property taxes for the west coast established communities increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period of the preceding year 
the increase is primarily the result of lower than estimated property tax assessments that resulted in a reduction in of previously accrued expenses 
east coast established communities property taxes for the east coast established communities on a pro forma basis increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the preceding year 
the increase is primarily the result of increased assessments of property values and increased property tax rates

the decrease is primarily the result of lower than estimated property tax assessments that resulted in a reduction in of previously accrued expenses 
interest expense decreased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to higher capitalization of interest from increased development  construction and reconstruction activity financed primarily with common and preferred stock issuances  offset in part by increased borrowing for new acquisitions

interest income increased  to  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  for the preceding year  primarily due to higher average cash balances during as compared to capitalization of fixed assets and community improvements the company maintains a policy with respect to capital expenditures that generally provides that only non recurring expenditures are capitalized 
improvements and upgrades are capitalized only if the item exceeds  extends the useful life of the asset and is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident 
under this policy  virtually all capitalized costs are non recurring  as recurring make ready costs are expensed as incurred  including costs of carpet and appliance replacements  floor coverings  interior painting and other redecorating costs 
purchases of personal property such as computers and furniture are capitalized only if the item is a new addition ie  not a replacement and only if the item exceeds  the application of these policies for the year ended december  resulted in non revenue generating capitalized expenditures for stabilized communities of approximately per apartment home on a pro forma basis for the merger 
for the year ended december  the company charged to maintenance expense  including carpet and appliance replacements  a total of approximately  for stabilized communities or per apartment home on a pro forma basis 
management anticipates that capitalized costs per apartment home will gradually rise as the company s portfolio of communities matures 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
a primary source of liquidity to the company is cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows have historically been determined by the number of apartment homes  rental rates  occupancy levels and the company s expenses with respect to such apartment homes 
the cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities have historically been dependent on the capital markets environment  and thus the number of apartment homes under active development and construction as well as those that were acquired during any given period 
cash and cash equivalents increased from  at december  to  at december  due to the excess of cash provided by financing and operating activities over cash flow used in investing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in operating income from the former avalon communities as well as the existing bay communities 
cash used in investing activities increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase in expenditures reflects increased construction and reconstruction activity  net of a decrease in acquisition activity which is attributable to the purchase of the southern california travelers portfolio in not present in combined with higher yield requirements in that constrained investing activity and the proceeds from the sale of communities in net cash provided by financing activities decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  primarily due to reduced financing activity in response to unfavorable capital markets 
the increase is also attributable to an increase in dividends paid  as a result of a common stock dividend increase in july and additional common and preferred shares issued in connection with the merger 
cash and cash equivalents increased from  at december  to  at december  due to the excess of cash provided by financing and operating activities over cash flow used in investing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in operating income from acquisition and existing communities 
cash used in investing activities increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase reflects the increase in expenditures for communities acquired in southern california  and the amounts used to acquire  develop  construct and reconstruct the development and redevelopment communities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  primarily due to higher net proceeds from securities offerings and borrowings under the unsecured credit facility in as compared to  offset by an increase in dividends paid 
the company regularly reviews its short term liquidity needs and the adequacy of funds from operations ffo and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
the company believes that its principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring operating expenses  debt service payments  the distribution required with respect to the preferred stock and the minimum dividend payments required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
management anticipates that these needs will be fully funded from cash flows provided by operating activities 
any short term liquidity needs not provided by current operating cash flows would be funded from the company s unsecured facility 
management anticipates that no significant portion of the principal of any indebtedness will be repaid prior to maturity and if the company does not have funds on hand sufficient to repay such indebtedness  it will be necessary for the company to refinance this debt 
such refinancing may be accomplished through additional debt financing  which may be collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
there can be no assurance that such additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
capital resources 
management intends to match the long term nature of its real estate assets with long term cost effective capital 
the company has benefited from regular and continuous access to the capital markets since its initial public offering  raising approximately billion  on a pro forma basis 
approximately million  on a pro forma basis  has been raised in capital markets offerings since january  the following table summarizes capital market activity for both avalon and the company since january  date company description of offerings january avalon million unsecured senior notes offering january avalon million direct placement of common stock to an institutional investor january bay million unsecured senior notes offering april bay million public offering of common stock july avalonbay million unsecured senior notes offering october avalonbay million public offering of series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock january avalonbay million medium term notes offering management follows a focused strategy to help facilitate uninterrupted access to capital 
this strategy includes hire  train and retain associates with a strong resident service focus  which should lead to higher rents  lower turnover and reduced operating costs  manage  acquire and develop institutional quality communities with in fill locations that should provide consistent  sustained earnings growth  operate in markets with growing demand as measured by household formation and job growth and high barriers to entry 
these characteristics combine to provide a favorable demand supply balance  which the company believes will create a favorable environment for future rental rate growth while protecting existing and new communities from new supply 
this strategy is expected to result in a high level of quality to the revenue stream  maintain a conservative capital structure largely comprised of equity and with modest  cost effective leverage 
secured debt will generally be avoided and used primarily to secure low cost  tax exempt debt 
management believes that such a capital structure should promote an environment whereby current ratings levels can be maintained  follow accounting practices that provide a high level of quality to reported earnings  and provide timely  accurate and detailed disclosures to the investment community 
management believes these strategies provide a disciplined approach to capital access to help position the company to fund portfolio growth 
recent volatility in the capital markets has decreased the company s access to cost effective capital 
see future financing and capital needs for a discussion of management s response to the current capital markets environment 
the following is a discussion of specific capital transactions  arrangements and agreements that are important to the capital resources of the company 
unsecured facility the company s unsecured facility is furnished by a consortium of banks that provides for  in short term credit and is subject to an annual facility fee of  the unsecured facility bears interest at varying levels tied to the london interbank offered rate libor based on ratings levels achieved on the company s senior unsecured notes and on a maturity selected by the company 
the current pricing is libor plus 
per annum and matures in july  with two one year extension options 
the unsecured facility  which was put into place during june  replaced three separate credit facilities previously available to the separate companies prior to the merger that had terms similar to the unsecured facility 
a competitive bid option which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans to the company at a rate that is lower than the stated rate provided by the unsecured facility is available for up to  which may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow 
pricing under the competitive bid option resulted in average pricing of libor plus 
for balances most recently placed under the competitive bid option 
at march    was outstanding   was used to provide letters of credit and  was available for borrowing under the unsecured facility 
the company will use borrowings under the unsecured facility for capital expenditures  acquisitions of developed or undeveloped communities  construction  development and renovation costs  credit enhancement for tax exempt bonds and for working capital purposes 
interest rate protection agreements the company is not a party to any long term interest rate agreements  other than interest rate protection and swap agreements on certain tax exempt indebtedness 
the company intends  however  to evaluate the need for long term interest rate protection agreements as interest rate market conditions dictate and has engaged a consultant to assist in managing the company s interest rate risks and exposure 
financing transactions completed in january  avalon completed a  offering of unsecured senior notes 
the notes bear interest at payable semi annually on january and july and will mature on january  the company used the net proceeds of approximately  to repay amounts outstanding under avalon s unsecured credit facilities 
in january  avalon completed the sale of  shares of common stock to the prudential insurance company of america at a net purchase price of per share 
the net proceeds of approximately  were used to retire indebtedness under avalon s unsecured credit facilities 
in january  bay issued  of senior unsecured notes  of which  of the notes bear interest at and will mature in january   of the notes bear interest at and will mature in january and  of the notes bear interest at and will mature in january semi annual interest payments are payable on january and july the net proceeds of approximately  were used to reduce borrowings under bay s then existing unsecured credit facility 
in april  bay sold  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to bay of approximately  were used to reduce borrowings under the company s unsecured credit facility 
in july  the company issued  of senior unsecured notes  of which  of the notes bear interest at and will mature in july and  of the notes bear interest at and will mature in july semi annual interest payments are payable on january and july the net proceeds of  were used to reduce borrowings under the company s unsecured facility 
in october  the company completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a public price of per share 
quarterly dividends are payable on march  june  september and december the net proceeds of approximately  were used to reduce borrowings under the company s unsecured facility 
in january  the company issued  of medium term unsecured notes bearing interest at and maturing in february semi annual interest payments are payable on february and august the net proceeds of approximately  were used to reduce borrowings under the company s unsecured facility 
registration statements filed in connection with financings on august   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission relating to the sale of up to  of securities 
the registration statement provides for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
future financing and capital needs as of december   the company had new communities under construction by the company or by others for the company for which the company has entered into forward purchase commitments with a total estimated cost of  remaining to be invested as of that date 
in addition  the company had a total of communities that were under reconstruction of which an estimated  remained to be invested as of that date 
substantially all of the capital expenditures to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction will be funded from the unsecured facility  the sale of existing communities  retained operating cash or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
management expects to continue to fund deferred development costs related to future developments from ffo and borrowings under the unsecured facility as these sources of capital are expected to be adequate to take the proposed communities to the point in the development cycle where construction can commence 
the industry and the company have seen a reduction in the availability of cost effective capital over the last nine months 
no assurance can be provided that cost effective capital will be available to meet future expenditures required to commence planned reconstruction activity or the construction of the development rights 
before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a development right commences  the company intends to arrange adequate liquidity sources to complete such undertakings  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
management estimates that a significant portion of the company s liquidity needs will be met from retained operating cash and borrowings under the company s unsecured facility 
to meet the balance of the company s liquidity needs  it will be necessary to arrange additional capacity under the company s existing unsecured facility  sell additional existing communities and or issue additional debt or equity securities 
while management believes the company has the financial position to expand its short term credit capacity and support such capital markets activity  no assurance can be provided that the company will be successful in completing these arrangements  offerings or sales 
if these transactions cannot be completed on a cost effective basis  then a continuation of the current capital market conditions described herein could have a material adverse impact on the operating results and financial condition of the company  including the abandonment of deferred development costs and the a charge to earnings 
during  the company determined that it would pursue a disposition strategy for certain assets in markets that did not meet its long term strategic direction 
in connection with this decision  the company s board of directors authorized management to pursue the disposition of certain communities 
the company will solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets  and will consider the sales price and tax ramifications of each proposal 
management intends to actively seek buyers for these assets during however  there can be no assurance that such assets can be sold on terms that are satisfactory to the company 
the company disposed of the following communities in connection with this disposition strategy dollars in thousands as of march  period apartment gross sales communities location disposed homes debt price net proceeds arbor park upland  ca q   avalon pointe stafford  va q    avalon ridge silver spring  md q    chase lea owings mill  md q    avalon at carter lake reston  va q   reflections fresno  ca q   sommerset vacaville  ca q   to facilitate the sale of sommerset  the company provided short term financing to the purchaser for of the gross sales price 
accordingly   of the net proceeds will be received at maturity of this financing 
the proceeds from the sale of these communities will be re deployed to the development and redevelopment communities currently under construction or reconstruction 
pending such redeployment  the proceeds from the sale of these communities were primarily used to repay amounts outstanding under the company s unsecured facility 
the remaining assets that have been identified for disposition include land  buildings and improvements and furniture  fixtures and equipment 
at december   total real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  of all communities currently identified for sale totaled  certain individual assets are secured by mortgage indebtedness which may be assumed by the purchaser or repaid by the company from the net sales proceeds 
the company s consolidated statements of operations includes net income from the communities held for sale of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in connection with an agreement executed by avalon in march which provided for the buyout of certain limited partners in downreit v limited partnership  the company sold two communities in july gross proceeds from the sale of the two communities  containing an aggregate of apartment homes  were approximately million 
because the proceeds from the sale of communities are used initially to reduce borrowings under the unsecured facility  the immediate effect of a sale of a community is to reduce earnings  as the yield on a community that is sold exceeds the interest rate on borrowings under the unsecured facility 
therefore  changes in the timing  number of dispositions and the redeployment of the net proceeds therefrom may have a material and adverse effect on the company s earnings

such short term leases generally minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty 
short term leases combined with relatively consistent demand allow rents  and  therefore  cash flow from the company s portfolio of apartments  to provide an attractive inflation hedge 
year compliance the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act of the year compliance issue concerns the inability of computer systems to accurately calculate  store or use a date after december  this could result in a system failure causing disruptions of operations or create erroneous results 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
management has been taking steps to understand the nature and extent of the work required to make its information computer systems it systems and non information embedded systems non it systems year compliant  as well as to determine what effects non compliance by the company s significant business partners may have on the company 
management has assigned key personnel to the company s year task force the task force to coordinate compliance efforts 
the task force is represented by executive  financial and community operation functions 
an outside consulting firm yk consultants has been engaged by the company to assist the task force in detecting non it systems that are not year compliant 
the yk consultants will aid in assessing the compliance of the company s non it systems and  for non compliant systems  will recommend replacement  upgrades or alternative solutions based on the system s importance to business operations or financial impact  likelihood of failure  life safety concerns and available contingency options 
management has identified certain phases necessary to become year compliant and has established an estimated timetable for completion of those phases  as shown below estimated completion date phase definition as of march  designate task force assign key management personnel completed to the company s year task force the task force to coordinate compliance efforts introduce year awareness communicate the year issue completed to the company

where necessary as determined by system inventory site specific contingency plans will be developed replace upgrade and test replace or upgrade certain replace upgrade july  solutions non compliant it and non it test october  systems and test functionality of critical systems communicate to residents communicate to residents steps october  the company has taken towards becoming year compliant and remaining it and non it systems that may still be impacted the year task force has completed the inventory system phase for computerized it systems 
the assessment determined that it will be necessary to modify  update or replace limited portions of the company s computer hardware and software applications 
the company anticipates that replacing and upgrading certain existing it systems both hardware and software in the normal course of business will result in year compliance by the end of the second quarter of the vendor that provides the company s existing accounting software has a compliant version of its product  but growth in the company s operations requires a general ledger system with scope and functionality that is not present in either the system currently in use or the year compliant version of that system 
accordingly  the company is replacing the current general ledger system with an enhanced system that  in addition to increased functionality  is year compliant 
the new general ledger system has been selected and is expected to be implemented by the third quarter of the company is not treating the cost of this new system as a year expense because the implementation date has not been accelerated due to year compliance concerns 
the cost of the new general ledger system  after considering anticipated efficiencies provided by the new system  is not currently expected to have a material effect either beneficial or adverse on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the task force has also completed the initial review of the inventory system phase of the company s non it systems eg  security  heating and cooling  fire and elevator systems at each community that may not be year compliant and has identified areas of risks for non compliance by community type 
the high rises  mid rises and newer garden communities represent the greatest risk of non compliant systems as they have the most systems per community 
in conjunction with the yk consultants  the task force is currently conducting an assessment of these systems at all communities to identify and evaluate the changes and modifications necessary to make these systems compliant for year processing 
the task force is currently conducting the follow up review of the inventory system phase to ensure any previously undetected non it systems are addressed for year compliance 
this review is expected to be completed by march  the yk consultants are currently in the process of verifying inventory and obtaining risk assurance regarding year compliance of detected non it systems  and this process is expected to be completed by april  the task force and yk consultants will prioritize the non compliant systems  if any  and proceed according to the phases described above 
no assurance  however  can be given that completion of the above phases will identify all non compliant systems 
upon completion of each of the above described upgrades and replacements of the company s it and non it systems  the company will commence testing to ensure year compliance 
testing will be performed on systems which are critical to business operations or life safety  which entail a material financial impact in the event of non compliance  with a high likelihood of failure  for which the task force is unable to obtain reliable third party assurance that the detected system is year compliant  and which are not deemed to have acceptable contingency options 
the company currently expects its testing to be completed during the fourth quarter of while the company anticipates such tests will be successful in all material respects  the task force intends to closely monitor the company s year compliance progress and will develop contingency plans in the event non it systems are not compliant 
the task force will create functional contingency plans by community type that will encompass substantially all of the company s existing portfolio  discussed above as general community contingency plans 
for certain communities  primarily communities with high rise buildings  specific contingency plans will be required  discussed above as site specific contingency plans 
the task force will continue to review both compliance and contingency plans  throughout all of the above phases  in an effort to detect if any systems will not be compliant on time 
management currently anticipates that the costs of becoming year compliant for all impacted non it systems will be approximately  based on the current progress towards the completion of the prioritize and budget phase 
based on available information  the company believes that the ultimate cost of achieving year compliance will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be year compliant by december  or that the company will not incur significant costs pursuing year compliance 
the third parties with which the company has material relationships include the company s utility providers and the vendor that will provide the company s new accounting software system 
the company  together with the yk consultants  is communicating with these and other third party vendors to determine the efforts being made on their part for compliance and to request representation that their systems will be year compliant 
no assurance can be given that such representations will be received by the company or that they will prove to be accurate 
as described above  the company expects that its accounting software will be year compliant 
the company is not aware of third parties  other than its residents and owners of communities for which the company provides community management services  to which it could have potential material liabilities should its it or non it systems be non compliant on january  the inability of the company to achieve year compliance on its non it systems by january  may cause disruption in services that could potentially lead to declining occupancy rates  rental concessions  or higher operating expenses  and other material adverse effects  which are not quantifiable at this time 
these disruptions may include  but are not limited to  disabled fire control systems  lighting controls  utilities  telephone and elevator operations 
currently  the company has not delayed any information technology or non information technology projects due to the year compliance efforts 
however  the company can neither provide assurance that future delays in such projects will not occur as a result of year compliance efforts  nor anticipate the effects of such delays on the company s operations 
funds from operations management generally considers funds from operations to be an appropriate measure of the operating performance of the company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the operating results of the company  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is determined in accordance with a definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts r  and is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
further  ffo as calculated by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation of ffo 
for the year ended december   ffo increased to  from  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of additional communities in connection with the merger and secondarily to delivery of new development and redevelopment communities 
growth in earnings from west coast established communities as well as acquisition activity in and also contributed to the increase 
ffo for the three and twelve months ended december  and are summarized on the following page dollars in thousands analysis of and funds from operations three months ended years ended net income available to common stockholders     convertible preferred dividend requirement    depreciation real estate related     joint venture adjustments amortization of non recurring costs minority interest  gain on sale of communities   funds from operations available to common stockholders     common shares outstanding     op units outstanding     average shares outstanding basic     shares issued from assumed conversion of preferred stock   common stock options    unvested restricted stock grants    average shares outstanding diluted     represents the amortization of pre bond issuance costs carried forward to the company and costs associated with the reissuance of tax exempt bonds incurred prior to the initial public offering of bay in march the initial offering in order to preserve the tax exempt status of the bonds at the initial offering 
management information systems the company believes that a state of the art management information systems infrastructure will be a key element in managing the company s future growth 
the company employs a proprietary company wide intranet using a digital network with high speed digital lines 
this network connects all communities and offices back to central servers in alexandria  virginia  providing access to company associates throughout the country from all locations 
this infrastructure also allows the company to employ new network computers that are less expensive to purchase and support  which reduces the company s total cost of ownership for each work station 
the company believes that timely and accurate collection of financial and resident profile data will enable the company to maximize revenue through careful leasing decisions and financial management 
during  the company began the development of a new property management system to enable the capture and analysis of data to an extent that would not be available using existing commercial software 
the company intends to develop this system through a joint venture with one or more public multifamily real estate companies 
the company currently expects that the total development costs over a three year period will be approximately million  and such development costs will be shared on a pro rata basis by those companies that participate in the joint venture 
once developed the company intends to use the system in place of current property management information systems for which the company pays license fees to third parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are monitored by management as an integral part of the company s overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
the specific market risks and the potential impact on the company s operating results are described below 
the company s operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowing under the company s unsecured facility as well as issuing bonds with variable interest rates 
if interest rates under the unsecured facility and other variable rate indebtedness had been one percent higher throughout  the company s annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  based on balances outstanding during the year ending december  changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt 
if the market interest rate applicable to fixed rate indebtedness with maturities similar to the company s fixed rate indebtedness had been one percent higher  the fair value of the company s fixed debt on december  would have decreased by approximately  based on balances outstanding at december  the company currently uses interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on variable rate indebtedness 
under swap agreements  i the company agrees to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate generally  the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into  plus a fixed increment thereto  and ii the counterparty agrees to pay to the company the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately million of the company s variable rate tax exempt debt 
the swap agreements were not electively entered into by the company but  rather  were a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of the company s tax exempt bond financings 
in addition  because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions with aaa credit ratings by the standard poor s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements  the company does not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty
