item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
significant events and known trends affecting tnp and tnmp competitive conditions the electric utility industry continues its transition toward an environment of increased competition 
tnmp expects the portions of operations pertaining to transmission and distribution to continue to be regulated 
pressures that underlie the movement toward increasing competition are numerous and complex 
they include legislative and regulatory changes  technological advances  consumer demands  greater availability of natural gas  environmental needs  and other factors 
the increasingly competitive environment presents opportunities to compete for new customers  as well as the risk of loss of existing customers 
the most significant effect of competition on tnmp  as well as other utilities  will be the ability to recover potential stranded costs 
stranded costs is the difference between what it costs tnmp to provide energy and what a customer would be willing to pay for energy in a competitive market 
the inability to recover a significant portion of stranded costs would adversely impact tnp s and tnmp s financial condition 
in texas  tnmp s potential stranded cost relates to tnp one  its mw generating unit  and could potentially be more than million 
in new mexico  tnmp s potential stranded cost relates to its fixed purchased power contracts 
as of december   tnmp had reserved million for its potential stranded costs in new mexico 
additional stranded costs could potentially be zero to million  depending on the market price of purchased power at the onset of competition 
legislators in both texas and new mexico have introduced bills that propose to open the business to competition 
the bills also address recovery of stranded costs 
in texas  tnmp s transition plan includes provisions for modifying the plan so that it conforms to subsequently enacted legislation the following discusses tnmp s strategy to transition to competition and to provide tnmp the ability to recover its potential stranded costs in texas and new mexico 
although the recoverability and amount of stranded costs is uncertain  management realizes there is some risk that shareholders may be required to share the financial burden of stranded costs with customers 
texas transition plan on july   the puct approved tnmp s transition plan  and issued a final order documenting its approval on november  the transition plan includes a number of provisions that impact tnmp s financial results 
they are tnmp will implement a series of residential and commercial rate reductions totaling and  respectively  during a five year transition period 
the first rate reductions for residential and commercial customers of and  respectively  were implemented retroactive to january  the remaining reductions will be effective in january of and tnmp s earnings on its texas operations are capped at an return on equity less assumed discounts on industrial rates  which  for  were million 
in  the discounts are expected to be approximately million 
tnmp will apply texas earnings in excess of the cap to recover stranded costs related to its generation investment tnp one or will refund them to customers  according to puct guidelines 
the plan includes a cap on allowed operating and maintenance expenses applicable to tnmp s texas operations based on cost incurred per customer in tnmp will record million of additional depreciation annually during to recover stranded costs 
finally  the manner in which tnmp recovers the cost of purchased power from its customers has changed 
in the past  all of these costs were passed directly through to tnmp s customers via adjustment factors that could change as often as monthly 
under this methodology  purchased power expense had no impact on operating income 
effective with the new rates under the transition plan  only the energy related portion of purchased power will be passed through directly to customers via the fuel adjustment clause 
the demand related portion of purchased power will be recovered through base rates and is not subject to adjustment or future reconciliation 
therefore  any difference  between the amount of demand related purchased power recovered through tnmp s rates and the actual cost of such  will affect operating income 
absent legislation implementing retail competition  at the end of the five year transition period  tnmp shall file with the puct a proposal to voluntarily implement retail access  contingent upon the approval of an appropriate mechanism for recovery of any remaining stranded costs 
the puct has committed to full recovery of stranded costs if they are quantified using a market based methodology  tnmp offers retail access  and stranded costs are allocated fairly to all customers 
during the year ended december   the transition plan reduced tnmp s operating income as summarized in the table below amounts in thousands except per share items pre tax amounts per share one time charges costs to implement the plan  one time customer refund  subtotal  impacts rate structure change  lower recovery of demand purchased power expenses  subtotal  total effect of the plan  the combination of the one time customer refund and implementing the rate structure change reduced operating revenue by million pre tax 
tnmp s earnings for the year ended december  did not exceed the earnings cap imposed by the transition plan 
the transition plan includes a provision that allows the puct to review tnmp s earnings and the related earnings cap 
new mexico community choice on april   the nmpuc approved tnmp s plan for transition to competition in its new mexico service territory  called community choice 
tnmp implemented community choice effective may  community choice provides tnmp s customers the right to choose their electricity provider after a three year transition period 
the plan freezes rates including the recovery of purchased power during the transition period  and allows for customer aggregation based on market forces 
as of december   tnmp had reserved million for its potential stranded costs in new mexico 
impact of competition on tnmp in addition to pursuing the satisfactory resolution of the stranded cost issue  tnmp is pursuing strategies to retain and attract new customers 
tnmp s competitive position has been strengthened with the puct open access to transmission rule 
management believes tnmp s revenue growth opportunities are through an increased customer base and new services 
as noted above  the transition plan changes the way tnmp recovers the demand component of purchased power 
the change increases the risk that tnmp will have to absorb increases in the demand cost of purchased power  while at the same time it allows tnmp to retain the benefit of savings realized from lowering these costs 
tnmp is actively managing its resources to optimize the rewards and diminish the risks in it power supply portfolio 
results of operations overall results income applicable to common stock was million for  compared to million in the results included the effect of fwi s discontinued operations of million  and costs to implement the transition plan of million

in late  management reevaluated fwi s strategy and adopted a revised strategy to concentrate on service and maintenance activities and to discontinue the construction segment 
in  tnp elected to discontinue all remaining operations of fwi 
see note for additional information regarding the discontinued operations

weather related  customer growth   reserve for texas customer refunds  lower recovery of texas demand purchased power costs  industrial firm rate sales   industrial texas economy rate sales  transmission revenue  unbilled revenue and other   base revenues increase decrease   the base revenue decrease of million during resulted primarily from the implementation of the texas transition plan and the loss of a significant industrial customer see note 
as discussed in note  the transition plan had the effect of reducing base rate revenues and reducing recovery of demand purchased power costs 
offsetting the base revenue decrease were increased sales due to hotter than normal weather during the summer  and customer growth in the residential and commercial classes 
the base revenue increase of million during resulted primarily from implementing the new transmission access rules during  growth in residential and commercial customers  and a full year of operation of its control area in texas that tnmp implemented on july  the control area is an electrical system that enables tnmp to instantaneously balance its system resources with loads 
implementation of the control area enabled tnmp to enhance its industrial economy rate sales  non industrial standby revenues  and power marketing sales 
the control area also permitted tnmp to replace standby power for tnp one with the purchase of planning reserves 
the components of gwh sales for and are summarized in the following table variance residential   commercial   industrial firm  economy   power marketing other total gwh sales   sales decreased gwhs or  from levels  due to the movement of a significant industrial customer to self generation and decreased off system sales 
this decrease was partially offset by increased residential and commercial sales due to hotter than normal weather and customer growth 
as discussed in competitive conditions texas transition plan and note  the puct approved the texas transition plan during the transition plan includes a five year transition period  with a series of rate reductions for residential and commercial customers beginning in the agreement provides for tnmp to recover a portion of its potential stranded costs during the transition period 
also  tnmp s earnings on texas operations are capped at return on equity less assumed discounts on industrial rates  which  for  were million 
texas earnings in excess of the cap will be applied by tnmp to recover stranded costs related to its generation investment tnp one or refunded to customers 
during  tnmp did not have any excess earnings on its texas operations 
this was primarily due to higher than expected demand purchased power costs as discussed in operating expenses purchased power fuel 
as discussed in competitive conditions new mexico community choice and note  tnmp implemented its community choice plan in new mexico on may  the plan provides tnmp s customers the right to choose their energy provider after a three year transition period and freezes rates including the recovery of purchased power during the transition period 
the rates represent a slight reduction as compared to rates in effect prior to may the reduced rates have not had a material adverse effect on tnp s or tnmp s financial condition 
a significant industrial customer in texas left tnmp s system in february and replaced the power previously provided by tnmp with power from a cogeneration plant built by a third party wholesale power producer 
this customer provided sales of gwh and annual revenues of million in million in base revenues 
purchases by this customer in were gwh  providing total revenues of million and base revenues of million 
during late  tnmp renegotiated with a large industrial customer in new mexico to continue providing full service until the end of the new mexico community choice transition period april  
effective january   this customer reduced its firm purchased power commitment by 
after the end of the transition period  tnmp will provide firm transmission service to this customer  and this customer can purchase its kwh requirements on the open market 
currently  tnmp is this customer s lowest cost us electric supplier 
this customer provided sales of  gwh and revenues of million in million in base revenues 
operating expenses operating expenses for were million higher than in  due primarily to higher purchased power expenses 
operating expenses for were million higher than in  due primarily to higher purchased power expenses stemming from increased sales requirements under agreements with two cogeneration customers and income taxes 
purchased power fuel expenses the following table summarizes the components of purchased power and fuel expenses in thousands 
increase decrease v

pass through expenses purchased power      fuel      subtotal      non pass through purchased power     other    total      during  purchased power and fuel expenses increased by million due to increased purchased power expenses during the hotter than normal summer weather  recognition of expenses in compliance with the transition plan  and settlement of a billing dispute 
as discussed in note  the transition plan changes the method of recovering purchased power expenses from customers 
effective january   only the energy related portion of purchased power is passed through directly to customers via the fixed fuel recovery factor 
the demand related portion of purchased power will be recovered through base rates 
therefore  any difference between the amount of demand related purchased power recovered through tnmp s rates and the actual costs will affect operating income 
texas demand charges are million of the million shown above as non pass through purchased power 
firm purchased power costs in new mexico account for the remainder 
recovery of demand purchased power in texas amounted to million in  resulting in a reduction of million in pre tax operating income 
prior to january   the majority of purchased power costs were recoverable from customers via a recovery clause 
during  purchased power and fuel expenses increased by million primarily due to additional mwhs purchased to meet increased sales requirements from the agreements negotiated with the two cogeneration customers during the second quarter of other operating expenses other operating expenses in increased by million compared to this resulted from additional transmission expenses of million as compared to  and the million write off of deferred costs related to the transition plan  as discussed in competitive conditions texas transition plan and note other operating expenses in were comparable to cost savings from reduced standby expenses resulting from implementation of the control area offset a million increase in the texas transmission expenses 
interest charges during  interest charges decreased million due primarily to reduced borrowings and lower interest rates on the credit facilities 
during  interest charges decreased million due primarily to the retirement of series t fmbs in january and applying cash flow from operations to reduce debt levels 
the series t fmbs were retired with lower cost borrowings from the credit facilities and an equity contribution from tnp in late  resulting from its common stock sale 
in january  tnmp retired its secured debentures when they matured 
it also issued million of senior notes due in interest charges are expected to continue to decrease during due to the lower interest rate on the senior notes and reduced borrowings against the credit facilities 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity the main sources of liquidity for tnp are cash flow from operations  borrowings from credit facilities and sale of additional common stock 
tnp s cash flow from operations totaled million  million and million in  and cash flow from operations decreased in due to increases in purchased power costs and expenses for nonregulated activities 
in addition  cash flow included million from the one time factoring of unbilled accounts receivables 
cash flow from operations increased in from due to factoring unbilled receivables and increased base revenues 
the changes in tnmp s cash flow from operations mirrored those of tnp 
tnmp has two existing credit facilities with a total of million of unused borrowings available  as of december  in january  tnmp entered into a third credit facility that provides million of borrowing capacity through april in november  tnp entered into a new credit facility with a total commitment of million  and unused borrowing capacity of million at december  borrowings under this facility can be used for investing in tnp s subsidiaries  payment of dividends to tnp s shareholders  investing in nonregulated businesses  and other general corporate purposes 
tnp reserved one million shares of common stock for issuance through a direct stock purchase plan that began in the plan is designed to provide investors with a convenient method to purchase shares of tnp s common stock directly from the company and to reinvest cash dividends 
the plan has replaced tnp s prior dividend reinvestment plan 
as of december   the remaining reserve for direct stock purchase plan was  shares 
capital resources tnp s and tnmp s capital structure continued to improve during  as tnmp was able to reduce debt due to continued strong earnings for the year 
the equity portion of tnp s capital structure increased from at december   to at december  conversely  the long term debt ratio decreased from to for the same period 
tnmp experienced similar results with its capital ratios 
tnmp s capital requirements through are projected to be as follows amounts in millions fmb and secured debenture maturities see note capital expenditures total capital requirements tnmp believes that cash flow from operations  borrowings in the capital markets  and periodic borrowings under the credit facilities will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and planned capital requirements through the foreseeable future 
other matters application of sfas as a result of the energy policy act of and actions of regulatory commissions  the electric utility industry is moving toward a combination of competition and a modified regulatory environment 
tnmp s financial statements currently reflect assets and costs based on current cost based ratemaking regulations in accordance with sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
continued applicability of sfas to tnmp s financial statements requires that rates set by an independent regulator on a cost of service basis can actually be charged to and collected from customers 
in the event that all or a portion of a utility s operations cease to meet those criteria for various reasons  including deregulation  a change in the method of regulation  or a change in the competitive environment for the utility s regulated service  the utility will have to discontinue sfas for that portion of operations 
that discontinuation would be reported by the write off of unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities 
as discussed in note  as a result of the community choice program in new mexico  tnmp discontinued the application of sfas to its generation power supply operations in new mexico during the discontinuing of regulatory accounting principles had no effect on tnmp s financial condition 
also  as discussed in competitive conditions texas transition plan and note  on july   the puct approved tnmp s transition plan  and issued a final order documenting its approval on november  the puct has committed to full recovery of stranded costs if they are quantified using a market based methodology  tnmp offers retail access  and stranded costs are allocated fairly to all customers 
rates under the transition plan continue to be cost based  and tnmp will continue to apply sfas to its texas generation power supply operations until it requests  and the puct approves authority to implement retail competition 
year tnmp is actively addressing the year issue yk throughout its operating and office environments 
many existing computer programs were designed and developed to use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
if not addressed  these computer systems could fail  with possible material adverse effects on tnmp s operations 
in mid tnmp s information technology staff began to identify and assess corporate software applications  equipment and operating systems 
in early  the project was expanded to include professionals from throughout the company and to identify and assess embedded systems 
tnmp s project to analyze yk has included the following phases identification  assessment  remediation implementation and testing 
in its analysis to identify and assess yk impact on company systems  tnmp has conducted extensive studies to analyze the impact of yk on all operating systems 
as a result of these studies  tnmp has developed a yk mitigation plan 
the plan requires tnmp to amend  replace  or upgrade most of its primary corporate information systems  some of which were already being replaced or upgraded pursuant to a previously approved plan to replace or upgrade such systems 
the following is a brief summary of the renovation and validation  and implementation progress for the critical business areas of tnmp generation  transmission  distribution  energy management  and corporate information systems 
generating units 
tnmp owns one power plant  tnp one  which is located in robertson county  texas 
tnp one has two units that burn lignite as the primary fuel source to generate power 
the total lignite supply is provided from a mine adjacent to the power plant 
tnp plans to increase the coal supply to provide for an additional six week supply prior to january  the plant is also capable of burning natural gas  as well as various waste products 
tnp one personnel are consulting with the manufacturers of the plant control computer which provides for most of the computerized operations of the boiler and turbine controls  as well as the continuous emissions monitoring system 
integrated testing of the plant control computer was completed on unit in early february the integrated testing on unit detected no yk problems 
testing will be done on unit while the plant is down for a maintenance outage this spring 
tests of the continuous emissions monitoring system determined that only non critical yk issues were detected 
upgrades to that software are currently underway 
an extensive list of other minor suspect devices has been compiled and is also in the process of being tested 
as of march   the tnp one generation plant has completed the assessment of all mission critical facilities  and is approximately percent complete with the testing and remediation of those facilities 
all testing and remediation is expected to be complete by june distribution system 
tnmp is primarily a distribution company 
over suspect distribution system devices have been identified and are being tested 
tnmp is currently testing the devices that have external clock functions 
devices that have no external clock function are being checked with the manufacturer and tnmp is reviewing their testing of those devices 
all of tnmp s critical distribution substations have designs which contain redundant relaying or bypass switching schemes to remove failed devices and equipment for normal operations  allowing for quick restoration of power to customers 
as of march   tnmp is percent complete on the assessment of all distribution system mission critical facilities  and is approximately percent complete with the testing and remediation of those facilities 
all testing and remediation is expected to be complete by june transmission system 
tnmp has transmission lines which are a part of the transmission grid comprised within the electric reliability council of texas ercot 
the transmission grid within ercot is operated by member utilities in conjunction with an independent system operator 
tnmp is participating on ercot s year technical task force and on the year operational preparedness and planning task force 
tnmp will be participating in all testing  drills and contingency planning done by the independent system operator 
testing of transmission line electronic protective devices by tnmp personnel is underway with completion anticipated by june supervisory control and data acquisition systems scada and energy management systems 
tnmp has three scada systems in texas 
a scada system reports on the status on protective devices  allows for the remote control of these same devices  and reports and tracks critical power flow information on the transmission and distribution grids 
these systems are new  having been upgraded in and tnmp is in the process of replacing the scada system in new mexico  which is not year compliant 
as of march   tnmp is percent complete on the assessment of all scada and energy management systems mission critical facilities  and is approximately percent complete with the testing and remediation of those facilities 
all testing and remediation is expected to be complete by june  except for the new mexico scada system that will be complete in august information technology systems 
as of march   approximately of tnmp s infrastructure supporting its business systems has been tested and verified as yk compliant 
tnmp expects to have the remaining infrastructure yk compliant by the end of the first quarter of tnmp has completed the upgrade of its financial and accounting system to a yk compliant version 
integrated testing of the upgraded financial system will be done in april a new customer information system is expected to be implemented and tested during the third quarter of and other corporate information systems directly related to tnmp s operations are expected to be installed and tested by september tnmp incorporates unit testing  system testing  integration testing and acceptance testing into the verification methodology 
yk remediation cost 
the costs associated with tnmp s yk efforts are expected to be approximately million 
approximately million of the total cost is to upgrade or replace various information technology systems  as discussed above  as well as improve the infrastructure to support those systems 
tnmp does not expect these costs to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
tnmp continues to work with key software vendors and outside consultants to validate its yk compliance project 
to date  tnmp has spent approximately million on yk remediation 
tnmp has in the past used  and expects to continue to use  cash flow from operations to fund costs associated with yk 
third party vendors 
in addition to its own mitigation plan  tnmp is actively working with its key vendors and other third parties with which tnmp has a material relationship to assist such parties in achieving compliance with respect to yk in those systems affecting tnmp s operations 
such parties include electric power providers in texas and new mexico  the fuel  ash disposal  and limestone contractors at tnp one  transmission and distribution material suppliers  and banking partners 
although tnmp believes that such persons are working diligently to properly address yk  tnmp cannot guarantee that these third party systems will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company or a conversion that is incompatible with tnmp s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on tnmp 
contingency plans 
the primary operating processes of tnmp s business eg  the production  transmission  and distribution of electric power are subject to contingencies related to weather  equipment failure  and other factors 
tnmp has drafted yk contingency plans by adapting previously existing contingency plans 
tnmp will complete the yk contingency plan by june the risks of the company s year issues 
based upon its current assessment and testing of the yk issue  tnmp believes the reasonably likely worst case yk scenarios would have the following impacts upon it and its operations 
with respect to its ability to provide energy to its customers  tnmp believes that the reasonably likely worst case scenario is for small  localized interruptions of electrical service that are restored in a time frame that is within normal service levels 
with respect to services that are essential to tnmp s operations  such as customer service  business operations  supplies and emergency response capabilities  the reasonably likely worst case scenario is for minor disruptions of essential services with rapid recovery and all essential information and processes ultimately recovered 
while risks related to the third parties lack of yk readiness could materially and adversely affect tnmp s business  results of operations and financial condition  tnmp expects its yk readiness efforts to reduce significantly its level of uncertainty about the impact of third party yk issues on both its it systems and non it systems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tnp s and tnmp s involvement in the trading of market risk sensitive instruments is minimal and does not have a material impact to either company s financial condition or results of operations 
as noted in item  sources of energy  tnmp s exposure to changes in the prevailing market price of power has increased 
this exposure is due to tnmp s greater reliance on shorter term contracts and  as discussed in item  competitive conditions  the fact that tnmp no longer passes the demand component of purchased power costs directly through to its customers 
as a result  tnmp is exposed to the risk of executing new purchased power contracts at market prices 
conversely  tnmp has the opportunity to benefit from a favorable market for purchased power
