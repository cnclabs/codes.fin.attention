influences on earnings the company s net income depends upon the combined results of operations of the banks  each of which conducts a commercial and consumer banking business by attracting deposits from the general public and deploying those funds to earning assets 
in addition  the non bank subsidiaries contribute income from management fees and commissions 
each bank s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is interest income on interest earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets include loans  investment securities and other earning assets  such as federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include customer deposits  time and savings deposits and other borrowings such as federal funds purchased  short term borrowings and long term debt  including junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
besides the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  net interest income is affected by each bank s interest rate spread 
this spread is the difference between the bank s average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread is impacted by changes in interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand  among other factors 
the levels of non interest income and non interest expense also affect the company s profitability 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is non interest income of the banks and non bank subsidiaries  consisting of investment trading fees and commissions  service fees  gains on the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities  and other fees 
non interest expense consists of compensation and benefits  occupancy related expenses  deposit insurance premiums  expenses of opening bank offices  acquisition related expenses and other operating expenses

income tax expense was million for compared to million for  a increase 
the effective tax rate on actual earnings was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate can be primarily attributed to citizens bank of tulsa  which was a taxable entity in asset liability management asset liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
an interest rate sensitive balance sheet item is one that is able to reprice quickly  through maturity or otherwise 
controlling the maturity or repricing of an institution s assets and liabilities in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of the repricing of assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
a mismatched gap position will normally result in greater changes in net interest income as interest rates change 
along with internal gap management reports  the company and the banks use an asset liability modeling methodology to analyze each bank s current gap position 
that methodology simulates the banks asset and liability base and projects future net interest income under several interest rate assumptions 
the company strives to maintain an aggregate gap position  so that changes in interest rates will not negatively affect net interest income by more than in any twelve month period 
the company has not engaged in derivatives or hedging transactions to synthetically alter net interest income 
the following table indicates that  at december   if there had been a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  the company s net interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in net interest income 
changes in net interest percent interest rate income change change basis point rise   basis point rise   base rate scenario  basis point decline   basis point decline   the following table sets forth the maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  as of december  term to repricing dollars in thousands zero to four months over one over three to twelve to five five months months years years total interest earning assets loans      investment securities      other interest bearing assets   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities savings deposits and interest bearing checking   time deposits      short term borrowings    long term borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap      cumulative gap     cumulative ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities ratio of cumulative gap to interest earning assets the cumulative gap value indicated above for the zero to five year periods indicates that a rise in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income 
the company has the ability to reprice the rates or savings deposits and interest bearing checking 
historically the rates on these deposits have been repriced when rates have had small movements 
financial condition lending activities commercial loans 
this category includes loans to service  retail  wholesale and light manufacturing businesses  including agricultural service businesses 
commercial loans were million as of december   or  of total loans 
the proportion of commercial loans decreased in  due primarily to acquisitions of banks during which have greater proportions of agricultural loans 
real estate loans 
real estate loans represent the largest class of loans of the company 
the company categorizes real estate loans as follows i commercial 
commercial real estate loans totaled million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
approximately million of such growth resulted from bank acquisitions accounted for as purchase transactions during  while the remaining growth resulted from growth in the johnson county  kansas  and tulsa  oklahoma  markets 
ii construction 
construction lending consists primarily of single family construction 
construction loans decreased primarily due to a decrease in such lending in johnson county  kansas 
iii to family residential 
residential loans totaled million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
loans in this category consist primarily of owner occupied residential loans 
since december   the mix of loans has shifted from fixed rate loans to variable rate products 
the company has elected to retain selected variable rate real estate loans  which has resulted in the loan growth in this category 
iv agricultural 
this category consists of loans secured by agricultural real estate 
agricultural loans totaled million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
the growth is almost entirely attributable to banks acquired under purchase transactions in growth among all other banks was relatively insignificant 
v held for sale 
loans held for sale represent residential loans intended to be sold to secondary investors  and are in the process of being delivered  and student loans held for sale 
the increase of is due to timing of loans made in the prior year as compared to the current year 
agricultural loans 
agricultural loans are typically made to farmers  small corporate farms  and feed and grain dealers 
agricultural loans were million as of december   compared to million as of december   an increase of million  or 
agricultural loans as a percent of total loans increased from in to in this increase is due to the fact that banks acquired under purchase transactions in held a disproportionately higher balance in agricultural loans than the banks owned at december  consumer and other loans 
loans classified as consumer and other loans include automobile  residential  other personal loans and credit card loans 
the majority of these are installment loans with fixed interest rates 
consumer and other loans were million as of december   compared to million as of december   an increase of million  or 
consumer and other loans represented of total loans as of december   an increase from as of december  these increases are primarily due to a million increase in consumer lending in johnson county  kansas 
the following table presents the balance of each major category of the company s loans as of december of each year

asset quality the company s asset quality compares favorably to its peer institutions 
the company follows regulatory guidelines in placing loans on a non accrual basis and places loans with doubtful principal repayment on a non accrual basis  whether current or past due 
the company considers non performing assets to include all non accrual loans  other loans past due days or more as to principal and interest with the exception of those loans which in management s opinion are well collateralized or exhibit other characteristics suggesting they are collectible  other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets 
the company does not return a loan to accrual status until it is brought current with respect to both principal and interest and future principal payments are no longer in doubt 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  any previously accrued and uncollected interest income is reversed against current income 
restructured and impaired loans are considered insignificant for all periods presented 
the company would have recorded additional interest in the amounts of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  if non accrual loans had been current during these periods 
non performing assets are summarized in the following table 
december  dollars in thousands loans loans days or more past due still accruing non accrual loans    non performing loans     other assets other real estate owned  non performing assets     non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets as a percentage of total assets non performing assets as a percentage of total loans and oreo allowance for loan losses the success of a bank depends to a significant extent upon the quality of its assets  particularly loans 
this is highlighted by the fact that net loans are of the company s total assets as of december  credit losses are inherent in the lending business 
the risk of loss will vary with general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and the quality of the collateral in the case of a collateralized loan  among other things 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses based on industry standards  management s experience  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectability is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the company actively manages its past due and non performing loans in each bank in an effort to minimize credit losses  and monitors asset quality to maintain an adequate loan loss allowance 
although management believes its allowance for loan losses is adequate for each bank and collectively  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses 
further  although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used  or adverse developments arise with respect to non performing or performing loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover loan losses or that significant increases to the allowance will not be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen 
material additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of the company s net income and capital and could result in the inability to pay dividends  among other adverse consequences 
the allowance for loan losses on december   totaled million  or of outstanding loans  compared to million or at december  charge offs were million  recoveries were  and provisions charged to expense were million 
in addition  allowance for loan losses of acquired banks were million

deposit activities deposits are the major source of the banks funds for lending and other investment purposes 
in addition to deposits  the banks derive funds from interest payments  loan principal payments  loan and securities sales  and funds from operations 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions 
the banks may use borrowings on a short term basis  if necessary  to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds  or borrowings may be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes 
deposits are attracted principally from within the banks primary market area through the offering of a broad variety of deposit instruments  including checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit including jumbo certificates in denominations of  or more  and retirement savings plans 
the banks have aggressively attempted to obtain deposits in selected markets to increase market share or meet particular liquidity needs 
the company has not used brokered deposits and has not sought to attract deposits outside its market areas 
maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the banks on a periodic basis

liquidity defines the ability of the company and the banks to generate funds to support asset growth  satisfy other disbursement needs  meet deposit withdrawals and other fund reductions  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
the immediate liquidity needs of the banks are met primarily by federal funds sold  short term investments  deposits and the generally predictable cash flow primarily repayments from each bank s assets 
intermediate term liquidity is provided by the banks investment portfolios 
the banks also have established a credit facility with the fhlb  under which the banks are eligible for short term advances and long term borrowings secured by real estate loans or mortgage related investments 
the company s liquidity needs and funding are provided through non affiliated bank borrowing  cash dividends and tax payments from its subsidiary banks 
as described in note to the financial statements  the company has a million line of credit with outstanding borrowings of million at year end 
capital 
the company and its subsidiaries actively monitor their compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
the elements of capital adequacy standards include strict definitions of core capital and total assets  which include off balance sheet items such as commitments to extend credit 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
historically  the banks have increased core capital through retention of earnings or capital infusions 
each bank s ability to incur additional indebtedness or to issue or pay dividends on common stock may be limited by regulatory policies and the terms of the outstanding securities 
at december   the company s tier risk based capital  total risk based capital and leverage ratios were  and  respectively  compared to minimum required levels of  and  respectively subject to change and the discretion of regulatory authorities to impose higher standards in individual cases 
impact of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than do changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rate changes do not necessarily move in the same direction or have the same magnitude as changes in the prices of goods and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
an interest rate sensitive balance sheet item is one that is able to reprice quickly  through maturity or otherwise 
controlling the maturity or repricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of the repricing of assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
a mismatched gap position will normally result in changes in net interest income as interest rates change 
along with internal gap management reports  the company and the banks use an asset liability modeling service to analyze each bank s current gap position 
the system simulates the banks asset and liability base and projects future net interest income results under several interest rate assumptions 
the company strives to maintain an aggregate gap position such that changes in interest rates will not affect net interest income by more than in any twelve month period 
the company has not engaged in derivatives transactions for its own account 
the following table indicates that  at december  if there had been a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  the company s net interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in income
