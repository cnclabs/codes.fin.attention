in february   duff phelps credit rating co 
joined moody s investors service s january  evaluation by assigning investment grade rating to the company s senior unsecured debt and preferred stock issuable under the company s shelf registration statement and convertible subordinated notes 
also in  standard and poors assigned an investment grade rating to the company s senior unsecured debt 
these investment grade ratings further enhance the company s financial flexibility 
the company has considered its short term one year or less capital needs  in conjunction with its estimated future cash flow from operations and other expected sources 
the company believes that its ability to fund operating expenses  building improvements  debt service requirements and the minimum distribution required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the internal revenue code  will be met by recurring operating and investment revenue and other real estate income 
long term greater than one year capital needs for property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major redevelopment projects  expansions  and construction of build to suit properties will be supported  initially  by draws on the company s unsecured line of credit  followed by the issuance of long term unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities 
management expects that a significant portion of the company s investment funds will be supplied by the proceeds of property dispositions 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rates in the company s markets of operation 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the leases are for remaining terms less than five years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rental rates if rents of existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
year compliance in response to the year issue  the company initiated a project in early to identify  evaluate and implement a new computerized real estate management system 
the company is addressing the issue through a combination of modifications to existing programs and conversion to year compliant software 
in addition  the company is discussing with its tenants  vendors  and other service providers the possibility of any interface difficulties relating to the year issue which may affect the company 
if the company and those it conducts business with do not make modifications or conversions in a timely manner  the year issue may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the total cost associated with the required modifications is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated results of operations  liquidity and financial position  and is being expensed as incurred
