overview invision technologies  inc invision or together with its subsidiaries  the company designs  manufactures and markets explosive detection systems eds based on advanced computed tomography ct technology 
invision was formed in september to design and develop an eds based on ct technology and exited the development stage in upon the first commercial sales of its product  the ctx system 
since such time  the company has received orders for a total of ctx series systems of which a total of had been shipped as of december  today  the company markets its more advanced ctx explosive detection system and has other products under development 
to date  the company s ctx system and the ctx system together  the ctx series are the only explosive detection systems certified by the federal aviation administration faa currently deployed for use in the inspection of checked luggage on commercial flights 
for the years ended december   and  the company had revenues of million  million and million  respectively  and as of december  the company had in backlog equipment orders and service agreements of approximately million 
in the first quarter of  the company received an order from the faa in the amount of million for an additional ctx systems 
on september   invision acquired quantum  a privately held developer of explosives detection equipment based on quadrupole resonance qr technology 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests in the quarter ended september   therefore  all prior periods have been restated to include quantum s results 
quantum is currently a development stage company with products in the prototype stage 
quantum is also a leading supplier of research and development services in the area of qr technology to a number of government agencies 
the company considers research and development to be a vital part of its operating discipline and continues to dedicate substantial resources to research to enhance the performance  functionality and reliability of its ctx series hardware and software as well as to the development of its next generation system  the ctx system 
at december   the company had full time employees engaged in research and development activities while also using the services of specialized contract employees and consultants in this area 
total research and development expenditures by the company are partially offset by amounts reimbursed by the faa and other government agencies and private entities under research and development contracts and grants 
the company believes that investment in research and development in absolute dollars will increase substantially to meet its future needs regardless of the level of funding received from research and development contracts and grants 
for the years ended december   and  the company spent million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
of these amounts  million  million and million  respectively  were funded under research and development contracts and grants 
to the extent that research and development contracts and grants receipts decline in the future  research and development expenses borne by the company would increase  and the company expects that its results of operations would be adversely impacted 
as of december   the company had in backlog research and development contracts and grants of approximately million 
an additional million research and development grant was received at the end of the first quarter of in any given year  the company s revenues have principally consisted  and the company believes will continue to consist  of orders of multiple units from a limited number of customers 
for the year ended december   million  or  of the company s revenues  were generated from sales to the company s largest customer  the us government 
for the year ended december   revenues from the company s largest customer  the us government  were million  or  of the company s revenues 
there were no other significant customers who accounted for more than of the company s revenues in and for the year ended december   million  or  of the company s revenues were generated from six customers who individually accounted for more than of the company s revenues 
no revenues were generated from sales to the us government in the company markets its products both directly through internal sales personnel and indirectly through authorized agents  distributors and systems integrators 
in the united states  the company markets its ctx series primarily through direct sales personnel 
internationally  the company utilizes both a direct sales force and authorized agents to sell its products 
for the years ended december   and  international sales represented  and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
the sales cycle of the ctx series is often lengthy due to the protracted approval process that typically accompanies large capital expenditures and the time required to manufacture  install and assimilate the ctx series 
typically  six to twelve months may elapse between a new customer s initial evaluation of the company s systems and the execution of a contract 
another three months to a year may elapse prior to shipment of the ctx series as the customer site is prepared and the system is manufactured 
during this period the company expends substantial funds and management resources but recognizes no associated revenue 
the company recognizes revenue on shipment unless extended acceptance criteria exist  in which case revenue is recognized upon achievement of such acceptance criteria 
the company typically requires customer deposits in advance of shipment on customer purchase orders 
provision for estimated installation  training  and warranty costs is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
systems typically carry a one year warranty 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expenditure items from the company s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated

the company s revenues are comprised of system revenues  which include sales of the ctx series  accessories  installation and configuration  and maintenance related to product support 
quantum research and development contracts and grants were reported as revenues prior to the acquisition by invision 
all quantum research and development revenues have been classified as a reduction to research and development expense in accordance with the company s policy 
revenues were million in  an increase of from the million in the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased sales of the ctx series  reflecting a increase in unit shipments to units in units to the faa  units to san francisco airport and units to international customers from the units in units to the faa and units to international customers plus the shipment of of the ctx upgrade kits purchased by the faa and the commencement of maintenance related revenues in the domestic market 
these factors were partially offset by lower average selling prices of systems shipped in due to configurations of units shipped and volume discounts in the second quarter of the company typically ships against a backlog of orders for its products

gross profit 
cost of revenues primarily consists of purchased materials procured for use in the assembly of the company s products  as well as manufacturing labor and overhead  warranty costs and costs associated with service agreements 
in any given period the company s gross profit may be affected by several factors  including revenue mix  product configuration  location of the installation  and complexity of integration into various airport environments 
gross profit was million in compared to million in gross margins were and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margins was primarily due to higher manufacturing overhead costs as a result of the company s relocation to a new facility in late  and configurations of units shipped and volume discounts in the second quarter of that resulted in lower average selling prices of systems in research and development 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of compensation paid to personnel engaged in research and development activities  amounts paid for outside services  and costs of materials utilized in the development of hardware products  including prototype units 
research and development expenditures by the company are partially offset by amounts reimbursed by the faa and other government agencies and private entities under research and development contracts and grants 
these services are provided on both a cost and cost plus basis 
the company believes that research and development expenditures in absolute dollars will increase substantially in the future regardless of the level of funding received from the faa and other government agencies and private entities 
net research and development expenses would have been million in without the capitalization of software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
under sfas  software production costs for computer software that is to be used as an integral part of the product or process are to be capitalized once technological feasibility has been established for the software and all research and development activities for the other components of the product or process have been completed 
in prior years  the period between achieving technological feasibility and the availability of software included in the company s product was short and software development costs qualifying for capitalization had been insignificant

foreign exchange risk and impact of inflation the company s international system sales and maintenance contracts are generally denominated in us dollars 
purchases of raw materials and other inventory components are primarily denominated in u 
s dollars  however  when denominated in foreign currencies  are generally made on an as needed basis 
the company generally does not have material advance purchase commitments in foreign currencies 
certain costs of providing warranty and maintenance services for systems sold to foreign countries are denominated in local currencies 
to the extent exchange rates fluctuate  it could become more expensive to provide these services 
to date  these costs have not been very significant  however  the company expects they will increase as the company s installed base increases 
the company does not hedge foreign currency risks 
the impact of inflation has not been material on the company s operations or liquidity to date 
year compliance definition 
the year issue is the result of a common computer programming convention that represents years in two digits eg for 
beginning in the year  these date code fields may need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
when the millennium date change occurs  these date sensitive systems and products may recognize the year as the year  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may result in system failure or cause systems to process critical operational or financial information incorrectly 
since the market for explosive detection systems certified by the faa is the company s largest market and the faa is the company s largest customer  the company has determined to apply the faa definition of year compliance as stated in the faa s year certificate of compliance to all of its products and operations year compliant means information technology that accurately processes date time data including  but not limited to  calculating  comparing  and sequencing from  into  and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  and the years    and leap year calculations 
furthermore  year compliant information technology  when used in combination with other information technology  shall accurately process date time data if the other information technology properly exchanges date and time data with it 
methodology achieving year readiness 
in  the company began year product assessment and planning to identify and remediate any compliance issues regarding product operation 
in december  the company instituted a more comprehensive year project designed to identify and assess the risks associated with its operations and infrastructure  information systems  suppliers and customers that were not year compliant  and to develop  implement  and test remediation and contingency plans to mitigate these risks 
the project  which is still in process  comprises four phases identification of risks  assessment of risks  development of remediation and contingency plans  and implementation and testing 
the status of the company s products ctx system and upgrade kits 
the faa has tested and certified that the current version of the ctx and the ctx upgrade kit are compliant with its year compliance definition 
this testing and certification was performed using the faa year yk repair process and standards handbook  as managed by a third party contracted by the faa 
all ctx systems shipped beginning in are compliant 
all ctx systems purchased by the faa and shipped prior to january   have been upgraded to compliance 
other ctx systems shipped prior to january  are not compliant but will ctx systems shipped prior to january  are not compliant but will be upgraded to compliance with the faa standard by invision at no charge to the customer if under an invision warranty or service contract 
ctx system 
identification and assessment of risks and establishment of fixes and upgrades have been completed for all released product software 
with respect to hardware the company has recently completed a component review for embedded chips  clocks and supplier testing of year compliance and found no material compliance issues 
although it will not be tested by the faa  the fix for the ctx is being designed to meet the faa year compliance definition and the company plans to use a test plan on the ctx similar to the one used by the faa in certifying compliance of the ctx the ctx year fix is planned to be released by the end of the second quarter of however  this schedule is dependent on investigation and testing of older configurations using older revision components that is not yet complete 
customers under warranty or service contract will receive this fix at no charge 
alternatively  ctx customers may purchase a ctx upgrade kit which provides the compliance certified by the faa and also offers other operational benefits 
this upgrade kit has been purchased and installed on all ctx systems previously purchased by the faa 
company infrastructure 
with respect to the company s internal computerized systems in its manufacturing  information  facilities and financial and administrative areas  the company has completed phases one and two identification and assessment of risks and is the early stage of phase three development of remediation and contingency plans 
outside consultants have been engaged to assist the director of quality assurance and the executive staff under the direction of the chief operating officer to complete this process  including the implementation of any necessary solutions and the design of any necessary contingency plans 
at this point in its review  the company is not currently aware of any year problems relating to systems operated by the company which cannot be resolved which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company expects to have all phases of this portion of the project completed by the end of the second quarter of suppliers and customers 
the company has submitted a survey to all current suppliers of products and services and is in the process of receiving and evaluating their responses 
however  the early phase of this stage of the project means that the company cannot yet predict whether significant problems will be identified and cannot yet determine the extent of any contingency planning that may be required 
even when completed  where the information provided is not subject to verification by internal testing  the company is vulnerable to any failure by its major suppliers  service providers and customers including airports and airlines which are the end users of its products to identify the full extent of and successfully remedy their own internal year issues 
this failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s supplies  orders or installation schedules 
the company is unable to estimate the nature or extent of any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third parties to achieve year compliance 
moreover  such third parties  even if year compliant  could experience difficulties resulting from year issues that may affect their suppliers  service providers and customers 
as a result  although the company does not currently anticipate that it will experience any material shipment delays from its major product suppliers or any material sales delays from its major customers due to year issues based on information developed through the current stage of its year project  these third parties may nonetheless experience year problems 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
costs of compliance 
based on the status of the company s efforts to date to prepare for the year  the company believes that the costs of compliance with respect to both its products and its infrastructure  including third party suppliers  will not exceed  as of december  approximately  had already been incurred 
risks of non compliance 
the company has not yet completed its assessments  developed remediation or contingency plans for all problems  or completely implemented or tested any of its remediation plans other than for the ctx system and ctx upgrade 
as the year project continues  the company may discover additional year problems  may not be able to develop  implement  or test remediation and contingency plans  or may find that the costs of these activities exceed current estimates of not more than  to the extent the company does not identify any material non compliant systems operated by the company or by third parties  such as the company s suppliers  service providers or customers  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is a systemic failure beyond the control of the company  such as a prolonged telecommunications or electrical failure  or a general disruption in the united states or global business activities that could result in a significant downturn 
the company believes that the primary business risks  in the event of such failure or other disruption  would include but not be limited to  loss of customers or orders  delays in installation  increased operating costs  inability to obtain inventory on a timely basis  disruptions in product shipments  or other business interruptions of a material nature  as well as claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation  or breach of contract  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
