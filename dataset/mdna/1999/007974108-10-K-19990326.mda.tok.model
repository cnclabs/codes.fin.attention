item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in advent s annual report to stockholders 
in addition  we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
our operating results fluctuate significantly and we may not be able to maintain our existing growth rates 
licenses into multi user networked environments have increased both in individual size and number  the timing and size of individual license transactions are becoming increasingly important factors in quarterly operating results 
the sales cycles for transactions of this size are often lengthy and unpredictable 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in closing large license transactions such as these on a timely basis or at all 
accordingly  if in the future revenues from large site licenses constitute a material portion of our net revenues  the timing of such licenses could cause additional variability in our quarterly operating results 
our software products typically are shipped shortly after receipt of a signed license agreement and initial payment and  consequently  software product backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents only a small portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and therefore are relatively fixed in the short term 
due to the fixed nature of these expenses combined with the relatively high gross margin historically achieved by us on products and services  an unanticipated decline in net revenues in any particular quarter is likely to disproportionately adversely affect operating results 
we have generally realized lower revenues from license fees in the first quarter of the year than in the immediately preceding quarter 
we believe that this has been due primarily to the concentration by some clients of larger capital purchases in the fourth quarter of the calendar year and their lower purchasing activity during the subsequent first quarter 
we believe our annual incentive compensation plans which result in increased year end sales activity compound this factor 
furthermore  we have often recognized a substantial portion of our license revenues in the last month of a quarter 
due to all of the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly since the initial public offering in november like many companies in the technology and emerging growth sector  our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations  particularly during times of high market volatility 
if net revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  our stock price could decline 
in addition  the stock price may be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance we depend heavily on our product  axys 
in  and  we derived a substantial majority of our net revenues from the licensing of axys and related products and services 
in addition  many of our other products  such as moxy  qube and various data interfaces were designed to operate with axys to provide an integrated solution 
as a result  we believe that a majority of our net revenues  at least through  will be dependent upon continued market acceptance of axys  enhancements or upgrades to axys and related products and services 
the success of our new product  geneva  is uncertain 
in  we introduced geneva to target organizations with complex international accounting and reporting requirements  and in late  we announced its full commercial availability 
we are directing a significant amount of our product development expenditures to the on going development of geneva and plan to devote a significant amount of our future sales and marketing resources to geneva 
we have limited experience in developing products for this market 
because of such limited client experience  there can be no assurance that geneva will not require substantial software enhancements or modifications to satisfy performance requirements of clients or to fix design defects or previously undetected errors 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing geneva 
our failure to successfully market geneva could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we are developing an internet initiative 
to take advantage of the internet  we have launched an internet initiative whereby we are developing services  both announced and unannounced  to bring internet based products and services to clients 
the first of these services  rex  was launched during the first quarter of the second service  advent browser reporting  was launched in the third quarter of as we begin development of new products and services under our internet initiative  we have and will continue to enter into development agreements with information providers  clients  or other companies in order to accelerate the delivery of new products and services 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing rex or in developing other internet services 
our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we depend upon new products and product enhancements 
our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to emerging industry standards and practices 
delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or enhancements may result in client dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues 
in addition  our ability to develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors  including certain system software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  database vendors and development tool vendors 
in the event that the products of such vendors have design defects or flaws  or if such products are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we depend upon financial markets 
the target clients for our products include a range of organizations that manage investment portfolios  including investment advisors  brokerage firms  banks and hedge funds 
in addition  we target corporations  public funds  universities and non profit organizations  which also manage investment portfolios and have many of the same needs 
the success of many of our clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets 
we believe that demand for our products could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations  disruptions  instability or downturns in the financial markets which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products 
additionally  during the next twelve months there is likely to be an increased customer focus on addressing year issues  creating the risk that customers may reallocate capital expenditures to fix year problems of existing systems 
our relationship with interactive data is important 
many of our clients use our proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data from interactive data 
interactive data pay us a commission based on their revenues from providing such data to our clients 
our software products have been customized to be compatible with their system and such software would need to be redesigned if their services were unavailable for any reason 
in the event that our relationship with interactive data were terminated or their services were unavailable to our clients for any reason  replacing these services could be costly and time consuming 
our competition is intense 
the market for investment management software is segmented by the relative size of the organizations that manage investment portfolios 
in addition  the market in each segment is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants 
our competitors include providers of software and related services as well as providers of timeshare services 
competitors vary in size  scope of services offered and platforms supported 
in addition  we compete indirectly with existing and potential clients  many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by independent vendors like us 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we considered the provision of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  however  we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
much of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  with the acquisition of portfolio management systems  these subsidiary revenues and capital spending are transacted in australian dollars 
results of operations from portfolio management systems are not material to the results of operations of advent  therefore  we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially adversely affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
however  a sharp increase in interest rates could have a material adverse affect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
the table below presents principal amounts by expected maturity in us dollars and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio
