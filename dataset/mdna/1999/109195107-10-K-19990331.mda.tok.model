the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and tax free reorganization

center economics 
the company s revenue is principally derived from the operation of family centers  and to a lesser extent  other services including consulting services 
family center revenues consist of parent fees for tuition  amounts paid by corporate sponsor clients to fund a portion of a family center s operating costs  and management fees paid by client sponsors 
revenue growth has primarily resulted from the addition of new family centers as well as increased enrollment and tuition  and expanded programs at existing family centers 
parent fees comprise the largest component of a center s revenue  and are billed on a monthly or weekly basis  payable in advance 
the parent fees are generally comparable to prevailing area market rates for tuition 
amounts paid by corporate sponsor clients are payable monthly and may be dependent on a number of factors such as enrollment  the center s operating costs  or budgeted amounts 
management fees are generally fixed  and payable monthly 
although the specifics of the company s sponsorship arrangements vary widely  there are two basic forms  the sponsor model and the management model 
the company employs the sponsor model in approximately of its family center sites 
under the sponsor model  a family center is operated at or near the sponsor s worksite 
the company retains profit and loss responsibility for the operation of the family center  and  as part of the arrangement  may receive financial support from the sponsor 
client support can take various forms  including reduced occupancy costs  tuition assistance and start up and or operating cost assistance 
newly opened sponsored centers generally operate at a loss until utilization levels reach approximately  which typically occurs within to months of operation 
in exchange for client sponsorship  the company gives priority enrollment to the children of employees or tenants affiliated with the sponsor 
under the management model  which comprises approximately of the company s operating sites  the company operates a family center under a cost plus agreement 
these contracts generally include a management fee and require that the sponsor reimburse the company for operating expenses in excess of parent fees or tuition within an agreed upon budget 
therefore  the company does not sustain pre opening or initial operating losses under the management model 
the management model centers experience slightly lower operating margins than the corporate sponsored model at full maturity 
under the sponsor model  the tuition paid by parents is supplemented in some cases by direct payments from sponsors and  to a far lesser extent  direct payment from government agencies 
under the management contract model  in addition to parent tuition  revenue also includes management fees and reimbursable expenses 
tuition  management fees and fees for priority enrollment rights paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized in the appropriate period 
in centers operating under the sponsor model  the company may be required to make capital expenditures necessary to initially fit out  equip and furnish the family centers  as well as make similar expenditures to refurbish and maintain existing centers 
while sponsors generally provide for the space or construction of the family center  the company may pay for leasehold improvements or construction costs 
the company may make capital investments when it is able to obtain favorable purchase terms or when a sponsor agrees to pay fees in advance for long term priority enrollment rights in the center  or for other guarantees 
in centers operating under the management model  the sponsor typically provides for all costs associated with building  fitting out  equipping  furnishing and supplying the family center 
the sponsor is also typically responsible for ongoing occupancy and maintenance costs 
cost of services expenses consist of direct expenses associated with the operation of family centers and with the delivery of consulting services 
family center cost of services consist primarily of staff salaries  taxes and benefits  food costs  program supplies and materials  parent marketing and occupancy costs 
personnel costs are the largest component of a family center s operating costs  and comprise approximately of a family center s operating expenses 
however  personnel costs will be proportionately larger in family centers operating under the management contract model and proportionally lower in family centers operating under the sponsor model 
consulting cost of services are comprised primarily of staff salaries  taxes and benefits  contract labor  and other direct operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries  taxes and benefits for non center personnel  including corporate  regional and business development personnel  accounting and legal fees  information technology  occupancy costs for corporate and regional personnel and other general corporate expenses 
amortization expense is being recognized over the period benefited by certain intangible assets  which include goodwill  non compete agreements and contract rights associated with acquisitions made by the company 
new centers 
in fiscal year  the company added new family centers  of which are operating under the sponsor model and of which are operating under the management contract model 
in the same period  the company closed centers which were not meeting operating objectives 
the company currently has over centers under development  scheduled to open over the next to months 
the opening of new centers is subject to a number of conditions and factors  including  among others  construction timing  sponsor needs and weather conditions 
seasonality 
the company s business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
demand for child care and early education services has historically decreased during the summer months 
during this season  families are often on vacation or have alternative child care arrangements 
demand for the company s services generally increases in september upon the beginning of the new school year and remains relatively stable throughout the rest of the year 
results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the performance of existing centers including enrollment and staffing fluctuations  the number and timing of new center openings and or acquisitions  the length of time required for new centers to achieve profitability  center closings  refurbishment or relocation  the sponsorship model mix of new and existing centers  the timing and level of sponsorship payments  competitive factors and general economic conditions

in addition  brhz acquired greentree centers in december and  due to the change in reported fiscal years described above  there is a full period of operations included in fiscal year for these centers compared to six months of operating results in fiscal year  generating a revenue increase of approximately million in fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue  to for fiscal year from for fiscal year  relates to improved performance in the greentree centers acquired in december as well as the proportionally lower number of centers operating under the management contract model which typically maintain somewhat higher expense levels

amortization

the company had working capital of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively

the company repaid million of debt and capital lease obligations  primarily with the proceeds from the public offerings of brhz and cfam  while incurring additional obligations of  for fiscal year the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents consist primarily of high quality commercial paper and institutional money market accounts 
the carrying value of these instruments approximates market value due to their short maturities 
management believes that funds provided by operations and the company s existing cash and cash equivalent balances and borrowings available under lines of credit will be adequate to meet planned operating and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
however  if the company were to make any significant acquisitions or make significant investments in the purchase of facilities for new or existing centers for corporate sponsors  it may be necessary for the company to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms  if at all 
year conversion the term year issue refers to the necessity of converting computer information systems so that such systems recognize more than two digits to identify a year in any given date field and are thereby able to differentiate between years in the twentieth and twenty first centuries ending with the same two digits eg and 
the company has and will continue to coordinate the identification  evaluation  and implementation of changes to computer systems and applications necessary to achieve a year date conversion with no effect on or disruption to its business operations 
the company is also evaluating non system issues relative to the year and beyond 
the company has communicated with suppliers  customers  financial institutions and others with which it does business to coordinate year conversion and will continue to monitor their progress to assess the potential impact in the event of non compliance 
the company believes the potential failure of third parties systems will not have a material adverse impact on the company s operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the company completed several projects as part of planned upgrades or replacements and not as part of the company s year conversion 
the company believes that the implementation of these projects had the effect of making a majority of the company s hardware and information systems year compliant 
during  as part of normal upgrades and replacements  the company spent approximately  to upgrade hardware it identified as not being year compliant 
the company anticipates that it will make capital expenditures of  to  to upgrade its hardware and information systems in the upgrades planned for are part of planned upgrades or replacements done in the normal course of business and not as part of the company s year conversion 
the projected costs for are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events 
there can be no guarantee however  that these cost estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially 
the company believes that the company s past efforts  in conjunction with the planned upgrades and replacements in  will substantially make its hardware and information systems year compliant 
as part of its year preparations  the company has identified its most reasonably likely worst case scenario as the replacement of hardware  software and equipment that are not year compliant 
notwithstanding the foregoing  management does not currently believe that the costs of assessment  remediation or replacement of the company s systems will have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  cash flows or financial condition

market risk foreign currency risk 
the company s revenues and expenses are both generated and denominated in united states dollars  and as such  changes in exchange rates will not have an impact on the company s operating results  financial position or cash flows 
interest rate risk 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted of commercial paper and institutional money market funds  which due to their short maturities are considered cash equivalents 
the company s primary objective with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
these investments  which approximate million  have an average interest rate of approximately and are subject to interest rate risk 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  the company s interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on the company s future interest income as a result of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of the company s investments inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operation 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
