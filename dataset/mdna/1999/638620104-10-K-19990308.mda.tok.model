sales of facilities or repayments of mortgages would serve to offset the aforementioned revenue increases

year readiness disclosure all statements contained in the following section are year readiness disclosures within the meaning of the year information and disclosure act 
the year issue the year issue in computers arises from the common industry practice of using two digits to represent a date in computer software code and databases to enhance both processing time and save storage space 
therefore  when dates in the year and beyond are indicated and computer programs read the date  the computer may default to the year rather than the correct this could result in incorrect calculations  faulty data and computer shutdowns  which would cause disruptions of operations 
the company is reviewing the risks of the year issue with regard to the company s own internal operations  information systems and software applications and the impact on the company of its outside vendors  lessees and borrowers ability to operate 
the company believes its own internal operations  information systems and software applications are likely to be compliant or will be compliant by mid based upon reasonable assurance by vendors and the company s information systems consultant 
the company s computer information system currently consists of personal computers and network server 
the company anticipates replacing its entire computer system during the first half of to enable it to upgrade its accounting software unrelated to the year issue 
the cost to remediate the year issues with regard to the company s internal operations  information systems and software applications is not believed to be material 
the company s vendors that provide banking  communications and payroll services and the company s lessees and borrowers will also likely be affected by the year issue 
if the company s vendors  lessees and borrowers are not year compliant  or if they face disruptions in their operations or cash flows due to year issues  the company could face significant temporary disruptions in rent and mortgage payments and  therefore  cash flows after that date 
the company s lessees and borrowers generally rely extensively on information systems  including systems for capturing patient and cost information and for billing and collection of reimbursement for health care services provided 
furthermore  the company s lessees and borrowers likewise are dependent on a variety of third parties  including  but not limited to  medicare and medicaid programs  insurance companies  hmo s and other private payors  governmental agencies  fiscal intermediaries that process claims and make payments for the medicare and medicaid programs  utilities that provide electricity  water  natural gas and communications services  and vendors of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals used in patient care  all of whom must also adequately address the year issue 
the company is currently reviewing publicly filed information of its lessees  borrowers and vendors regarding their state of readiness with respect to identifying and remediating their year issues 
in january of  the company began sending questionnaires to and or contacting its lessees  borrowers and vendors regarding their state of readiness with respect to identifying and remediating their year issues 
the company plans to complete the assessment by mid however  it is not possible for the company to determine or be assured that adequate remediation of the year issue will be accomplished by such lessees  borrowers and vendors 
furthermore  it is not possible for the company to determine or be assured that third parties upon which the company s lessees  borrowers and vendors are dependent  will accomplish adequate remediation of their year issues 
the company will also have risks associated with year issues in non information technology areas as it relates to owned properties 
there is a risk that embedded chips in elevators  security systems  electrical systems and similar technology driven devices may stop functioning due to year issues 
substantially all of the company s owned properties are leased under triple net leases and as such  the cost to remediate any of these items will be paid by the lessees 
based on currently available information  the company believes that the impact of the year issue  as it relates to its internal operations  information systems and software applications will not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that the year issues of its vendors  lessees  borrowers and third parties upon which they are dependent will not have a material impact on the future operations and or financial results of the company 
readers are cautioned that most of the statements contained in the year readiness disclosure paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
impact of new accounting pronouncements the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income in this statement requires that all items that meet the definition of components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized 
components of comprehensive income include revenues  expenses  gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income 
there are no differences between the company s net income  as reported  and comprehensive income  as defined  for the periods presented  or as of december  the company has also adopted sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information in the company believes it operates in only one business segment 
issue no 
accounting for internal costs relating to real estate property acquisitions released by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board which prohibits the capitalization of internal costs related to the acquisition of operating property was issued during the first quarter of the impact of this pronouncement is immaterial to the company s financial statements 
market risk exposure the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its mortgage loans receivable and debt 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand the company s sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in the market risk exposure paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
the company provides mortgage loans to operators of healthcare facilities as part of its normal operations 
the majority of the loans have fixed rates 
four of the mortgage loans have adjustable rates  however  the rates adjust only once or twice over the loan lives and the minimum adjusted rate is equal to the current rate 
therefore  all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
the company utilizes debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  the company has made short term borrowings on its bank line of credit to fund its acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
the company holds variable rate debt in the form of housing revenue bonds  which were assumed in connection with certain healthcare facility acquisitions because of the favorable interest rates  which in turn provided favorable lease rates to the sellers lessees 
pursuant to the associated lease arrangements  increases or decreases in the interest rates on the housing revenue bonds would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the associated rent received by the company on the properties securing this debt 
therefore  there is substantially no market risk associated with the company s variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
the company generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates 
certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt  excluding the convertible debentures  require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to the company for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 
maturity date thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable     average interest rate 
liabilities debt fixed rate        average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate bank borrowings    average interest rate convertible debentures    average interest rate the company does not believe that the future market rate risks related to the above securities will have a material impact on the company or the results of its future operations
