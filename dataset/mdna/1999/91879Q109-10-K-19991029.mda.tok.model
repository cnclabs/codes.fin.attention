the following is an analysis of the company s results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
to the extent that the following management s discussion and analysis contains statements which are not of a historical nature  such statements are forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive environment of the ski and resort industries  general business and economic conditions  the weather and other factors discussed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
on september   the company changed its fiscal year end from september to july accordingly  the fiscal period ended on july  and consisted of ten months 
this management s discussion and analysis discusses the following comparisons between the following periods 
fiscal year ended july  and pro forma twelve months ended july  
fiscal year ended july  and fiscal ten months ended july   
fiscal ten months ended july  and pro forma fiscal year ended september  the pro forma year ended september  gives effect to the keystone and breckenridge acquisitions and the initial public offering as if they had occurred on october  the pro forma twelve months ended july  reflects the company s change in fiscal year end and is presented to compare year to date results for the new fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal year ended july  versus pro forma twelve months ended july  dollars in thousands the unaudited pro forma results of operations for the twelve months ended july  give effect to the company s change in fiscal year end and exclude the results of arapahoe basin  which the company divested in september pro forma twelve year months ended ended july  july  percentage increase increase audited unaudited resort revenue    resort operating expense    resort revenue 
resort revenue for the fiscal year ended july  and the twelve months ended july  are presented by category as follows dollars in thousands pro forma twelve year months ended ended percentage july  july  increase increase decrease decrease unaudited lift tickets    ski school   dining    retail rental    hospitality    other    total resort revenue    total skier days   etp lift ticket revenue decreased due to a decrease in total skier days as well as a decrease in etp effective ticket price  etp  is defined as total lift ticket revenue divided by total skier days 
management attributes the decrease in skier days to above average temperatures and below average snowfall throughout the majority of the ski season  which had a negative impact on the entire colorado market 
in addition  the adverse perception resulting from the october  fires on vail mountain  and the canadian dollar exchange rate  which favored the canadian ski industry  also impacted skier days 
the decrease in etp is the result of a shift in the proportion of total skier days to local and front range denver colorado springs metropolitan areas skier days 
lift tickets sold to local and front range skiers tend to have a lower etp than tickets sold to destination guests 
this shift mainly occurred due to the popularity of the buddy pass  a discounted four person season pass for keystone and breckenridge  which accounted for a significant portion of local and front range skier days 
ski and snowboard school revenue decreased due to the overall decline in skier days as well as the shift in the proportion of total skier days from destination guests to local and front range skiers 
local and front range skiers are less likely to purchase lessons than destination skiers are 
the decline in revenue from the drop in skier days was partially offset by price increases as well as an increase in the percentage of higher priced packages sold 
the increase in dining revenue is primarily a result of the addition of new dining facilities through acquisition and new construction  coupled with modest growth at existing facilities 
the company opened tenmile station  the first new on mountain restaurant at breckenridge in over years  during the ski season 
the acquisitions of village at breckenridge vab and grand teton lodge company grand teton in fiscal each added eight dining facilities 
in addition  the results of the four dining operations added through acquisition in fiscal are reflected for the full fiscal period in fiscal  as opposed to the truncated period reflected during the acquisition year 
retail rental revenue increased significantly due to the company s retail rental joint venture ssi venture llc  which increased the total number of retail rental outlets from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal specialty sports  inc  the company s partner in the joint venture  is one of the largest retailers of ski and golf related sporting goods in colorado  and contributed approximately retail and rental outlets to the joint venture 
hospitality revenue increased as a result of strong performance from existing operations  achieved through effective yield management and growth of the managed property inventory 
the acquisitions of vab and grand teton in fiscal also contributed significantly 
in addition to adding lodging capacity  vab also added property management operations and a vacation services operation travel agency 
the company also received the benefit of a full fiscal year s revenues from its fiscal hotel acquisitions  rather than the truncated period from the acquisition date  which also contributed to the increase 
the increase in other revenue is a result of the increased popularity of summer mountain activities  including the alpine slide at breckenridge mountain  as well as expanded contract services for beaver creek  bachelor gulch  and arrowhead villages  growth in club operations  expanded licensing and sponsorship contracts  and increases in commercial leasing revenue 
the acquisitions of vab and grand teton also significantly contributed to other revenue through recreation and special events 
resort operating expense 
resort operating expense for the year ended july  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to the twelve months ended july  the increase in resort operating expense is primarily attributable to the incremental operating expenses contributed by vab  ssi venture llc and grand teton 
in addition  operating expenses of the company s fiscal acquisitions are reflected for the full fiscal year  as opposed to the truncated period from the date of acquisition for the twelve months ended july  a portion of the increase can also be attributed to the increased variable expenses associated with the increased level of resort revenue derived from non lift businesses such as dining  retail rental and hospitality operations 
these operations tend to have a greater level of variable operating expenses proportionate to revenues as compared to lift operations 
these increases have been partially offset by cost saving measures that have been implemented at all levels of our operations throughout the fiscal year 
real estate revenue 
revenue from real estate operations for the year ended july  was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the twelve months ended july  the decrease is attributed to the sell out of homesites at bachelor gulch village in the twelve months ended july  revenue for fiscal consisted primarily of the sales of the bell tower mall  one luxury residential penthouse condominium at the lodge at vail  the sale of three development sites at arrowhead village  the sale of two single family homesites and four multi family homesites at bachelor gulch  as well as the profit share from the company s investment in keystone intrawest llc

interest expense 
during the year ended july  and the twelve months ended july   we recorded interest expense of million and million  respectively  relating primarily to our credit facility  the industrial development bonds and the subordinated debt issued in may the increase in interest expense for the year ended july  compared to the twelve months ended july   is attributable to the outstanding senior subordinated notes issued in may  offset by a reduction in the balance outstanding on the credit facility

fiscal ten months ended july  versus pro forma fiscal year ended september  the following unaudited pro forma results of operations for the year ended september   assume the acquisition of keystone and breckenridge occurred on october  these pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the actual results of operations that would have been achieved nor are they necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
the unaudited pro forma financial information below excludes the results of arapahoe basin  which was divested in september a comparison of actual fiscal year results to the ten months ended july  would not be relevant  as the results of keystone and breckenridge would only be reflected from the acquisition date of january  in the fiscal actual results  whereas in the ten months ended july  keystone and breckenridge results are reflected for the full period

resort revenue for the ten months ended july  and for the fiscal year ended september  are presented by category as follows dollars in thousands pro forma ten months year ended ended percentage july  september  increase increase decrease decrease unaudited lift tickets    ski school    dining    retail rental    hospitality    other    total resort revenue    total skier days   etp lift ticket revenue increased due to a increase in effective ticket price partially offset by a decline in the number of total skier days 
the increase in etp is primarily due to increases in lead ticket prices at each resort  a less aggressive ticket discounting strategy  and improvement in the proportion of destination skier days to total skier days 
the increase in lead ticket prices and less aggressive discounting is consistent with our strategy to provide a high quality guest experience at a premium price 
the improvement in the proportion of destination skier days was driven by an increase in destination skier days and a decline in local and front range skier days non destination skier days 
we attribute the increase in destination guests to our new and innovative marketing and loyalty programs and continuous commitment to guest service 
the decline in local and front range skier days is primarily attributable to unusual weather patterns and below average snowfall for much of the season at our resorts 
ski school revenue increased primarily due to price increases and an increase in the number of ski and snowboard lessons sold 
the number of lessons increased due to an increase in the number of destination skiers  whom have a greater tendency to purchase lessons than do local and front range guests 
additionally  the beaver creek children s program has continued its success due to a number of initiatives designed to increase participation 
demand continued to be strong for snowboarding and private lessons driven by the popularity of snowboarding and the increase in destination guests 
dining revenue increased as a result of strong performance from existing operations  the opening of several new dining operations  and the addition of dining operations acquired in three hotel acquisitions 
five dining operations were new to vail mountain in the ten months ended july   including the addition of two fine dining facilities from the lodge at vail acquisition  and two facilities in the newly renovated and expanded golden peak base facility  resulting in an overall seating capacity increase of 
beaver creek opened seven new operations  six of which are located in the recently completed beaver creek village core  thereby increasing seating capacity by 
four dining operations were new to breckenridge and keystone resorts during the ten months ended july   consisting of the operations acquired in the acquisitions of the great divide lodge formerly breckenridge hilton and the inn at keystone and two new on mountain operations 
retail and rental revenues increased due to strong performance from existing operations and the addition of three new operations 
increases in existing operations were led by the completion of the beaver creek village core  which provided a complementary balance of retailers in beaver creek village  making it an attractive retail shopping destination  and the newly renovated and expanded golden peak facility at the base of vail mountain 
two new rental operations were opened in beaver creek village and one new retail rental operation was opened in a strategic location at the base of peak in breckenridge  where the company formerly had no presence in the retail rental market 
the company s retail and rental business also benefited from continuing improvements in inventory management and store product mix 
hospitality revenue increased due to an increasing base of property management services  growth in the travel and reservations businesses  and the acquisitions of the lodge at vail  the great divide lodge f k a breckenridge hilton  and the inn at keystone 
property management services contributed toward the growth over the ten months ended july  due to an increase in occupancy and average daily rate defined as revenue divided by room nights at beaver creek resort driven by the increase in skier days and number of rooms under management 
other revenue increased as a result of the increased popularity of adventure ridge at the top of vail mountain  expanded contract services for beaver creek  bachelor gulch  and arrowhead villages  the expansion of the beaver creek club  licensing and sponsorship revenue growth  and increases in brokerage and commercial leasing revenue 
resort operating expense 
resort operating expense was million for the ten months ended july   compared to million for the year ended september  as a percentage of resort revenue  resort operating expense decreased from in fiscal to in the ten months ended july  the overall increase in resort operating expense is attributable to increased variable operating expenses resulting from the increased level of resort revenue derived from non lift businesses such as dining  retail rental  hospitality and other operations

the company completed a million debt offering of senior subordinated notes the notes on may  the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of  with interest due semi annually on may and november  beginning november  the notes will mature on may  and no principal payments are due to be paid until maturity 
the company has certain early redemption options under the terms of the notes 
substantially all of the company s subsidiaries have guaranteed the notes 
the notes are subordinated to certain of the company s debts  including the credit facility  and will be subordinated to certain of the company s future debts 
net proceeds from the offering were million  and were applied against the outstanding balance on the credit facility 
the terms of the notes restrict the company s ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends or dispose of significant assets 
in conjunction with the debt offering the company amended its credit facility on may  the amended credit facility provides the company with additional financial flexibility

the credit facility matures on december  during the year ended july    employee stock options were exercised at exercise prices ranging from to 
additionally   shares were issued to management under the company s restricted stock plan 
based on current levels of operations and cash availability  management believes the company is in a position to satisfy its current working capital  debt service  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance the year issue is a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs which are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in major computer system or program failures or miscalculations or equipment malfunctions 
the company recognizes that the impact of the year issue extends beyond traditional computer hardware and software to embedded hardware and software contained in equipment used in operations  such as chairlifts  alarm systems and elevators  as well as to third parties 
state of readiness 
the year issue is being addressed internally by the company s individual business units under the direction of the information systems department 
the company has established a year task force consisting of representatives from all major business units to coordinate its year efforts  and progress is reported periodically to a year executive committee consisting of certain senior management members 
the company has committed resources to conduct risk assessments and to take corrective action  where required  within each of the following areas information technology  operations equipment  and external parties 
information technology includes telecommunications as well as traditional computer software and hardware in the mainframe  midrange and distributed applications environments 
operations equipment includes all automation and embedded chips used in business operations 
external parties include any third party with whom the company interacts  or upon whom the company relies in the performance of day to day operations 
the company s program for addressing the year issue includes the following phases inventory  assessment  remediation  testing  and contingency planning 
approximately of the company s normal information technology work has been deferred due to the fact that personnel of the information systems department have dedicated certain portions of their time to the year issue 
however  the company plans to complete and implement its information technology projects as planned 
the company has traditionally upgraded and replaced its information technology systems on a regular basis 
as a result of this process  most of the company s information technology systems and applications are currently year compliant 
in the remaining information technology area  inventory and assessment audits in the telecommunications  mainframe  midrange and distributed applications areas are substantially complete with remediation  verification and testing expected to be completed by october  with respect to operations equipment  the company has identified areas that it considers mission critical  in that a year failure could impact the health or safety of employees or resort guests or could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company has engaged a third party consultant to assist in completing inventory and assessment audits of operations equipment 
the company has extended its targeted completion date for these audits to october  to allow the outside consulting firm to perform the necessary work 
the company now expects remediation  verification and testing with respect to operations equipment to be completed by november  the company is communicating with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with our systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
many of the external parties that the company relies on provide commodity goods or services that are widely available from a range of vendors  therefore  third party impact is expected to be minimal 
the company is seeking confirmation of year compliance from critical suppliers and identifying alternative suppliers as part of its contingency plans 
the company will seek letters of compliance or other satisfactory evidence of compliance for example  web site disclosures from certain non critical suppliers based on risk assessment of such suppliers 
risk assessment with respect to external parties has been completed although monitoring of risk in this area will continue throughout  as many external parties will not have completed their work with respect to the year issue 
costs 
the total estimated multi year cost of the year project is estimated to be between  and  and is being funded from operating cash flow 
these costs are not expected to be material to the company s consolidated results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
of the total project cost  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software or equipment that will be capitalized 
the remaining costs will be expensed as incurred 
in a number of instances  the company may decide to install new software or upgraded versions of current software programs that are year compliant 
in these instances  the company may capitalize certain costs of the new system in accordance with current accounting guidelines 
as of july   of the total estimated year project costs have been incurred of which  has been expensed and  was capitalized 
fiscal expensed costs were approximately  and expensed costs for the year ended july  were approximately  costs exclude expenditures for systems that were replaced under the company s regularly planned schedule 
risks 
failure to address a year issue could result in a business disruption that could materially affect the company s operations  liquidity or capital resources 
management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would consist of isolated instances of minor system or equipment failures  for which the company will have developed contingency plans 
there is still uncertainty around the scope of the year issue and its implications for the company 
at this time management cannot quantify the potential impact of these failures 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  as well as  in part  the uncertainty of the year readiness of suppliers and the current status of the company s year program  management is unable to determine at this time whether any year failures will have material adverse consequences on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company s year program and related contingency plans are being developed to address issues within the company s control and to reduce the level of the company s uncertainty about its year issues 
the program minimizes  but does not eliminate  the issues relating to external parties 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify or remediate its potential year problems and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on the company 
contingency plans 
the company is developing contingency plans which will consider  among other factors  the results and responses from communications with material third parties in determining the nature and the scope of such contingency plans 
however  generally  the company s contingency plans will include  but are not limited to  development of manual work arounds to system failures  identification of alternative sources for goods and services and reasonable increases in the amount of on hand goods and supplies 
typically these plans address the anticipated consequences of single events  while the scope of the year issues may cause multiple concurrent events for a longer duration 
development of contingency plans for single events is expected to be completed by october  and development of contingency plans for multiple concurrent events is in progress and is expected to be completed by november  the costs of the project  estimated completion dates  worst case scenario and other forward looking statements above are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantees that these estimates will be achieved  or that events will occur as projected  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  timely implementation of and allocation of resources to the company s year program  success in identifying computer systems and non information technology systems that contain two digit date codes  appropriate risk assessment and prioritization of such systems  the nature and amount of programming and testing required and the time it actually takes to upgrade  replace or otherwise take corrective action with respect to each of the affected systems and the success of the company s suppliers and other external parties with which the company interacts in addressing their year issues 
inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the cost of operating resorts increases the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to its customers  however there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on the company s future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s ski and resort operations are extremely seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenues and profits at the company s ski resorts are substantially lower  historically resulting in losses  in the summer months due to the closure of its ski operations 
conversely  grand teton s peak operating season occurs during the summer months while the winter season generally results in operating losses due to closure of all revenue operations 
however  revenues and profits generated by grand teton s summer operations are not sufficient to fully offset the company s off season losses from its ski resorts 
during the fiscal year  of total resort revenues were earned during the second and third fiscal quarters 
quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of snowfall and the integration of acquisitions 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the company is taking steps to smooth its earnings cycle by investing in additional summer activities such as golf course development  including acquiring new resorts  such as grand teton 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for quarterly financial highlights 
economic downturn skiing and tourism are discretionary recreational activities that can be impacted by a significant economic slowdown  which  in turn  could impact the company s operating results 
although historically economic downturns have not had an adverse impact on the company s operating results  there can be no assurance that a decrease in the amount of discretionary spending by the public in the future would not have an adverse effect on the company 
unfavorable weather conditions the ski industry s ability to attract visitors to its resorts is influenced by weather conditions and the amount of snowfall during the ski season 
unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect skier days 
in the past years the company s ski resorts have averaged between and inches of annual snowfall  significantly in excess of the average for us ski resorts 
despite the substantial snowfall  the company manages its exposure to unfavorable weather conditions by investing in the latest technology in snowmaking systems and actively acquiring additional water rights  which has allowed the company to offer its guests more predictable and more consistent snow conditions  particularly during the early and late ski season 
although historically unfavorable weather conditions as a single factor have not had a materially adverse impact on the company s operating results  there can be no assurance that unfavorable weather conditions in the future would not have an adverse effect on the company s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its floating rate debt 
swap agreements exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
the notional amounts of interest rate agreements are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent an amount of exposure to credit loss 
for interest rate instruments that effectively hedge interest rate exposures  the net cash amounts paid or received on the agreements are accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
as of july   the company had swap agreements in effect with notional amounts totaling million  of which million will mature in february the remaining million will mature december borrowings not subject to swap agreements at july  totaled million 
swap agreement rates are based on one month libor 
based on average floating rate borrowings outstanding during the year ended july   a basis point change in libor would have caused the company s monthly interest expense to change by  management believes that these amounts are not significant to the company s earnings
