item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding seven seas financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  and for the period from inception february  to december  from time to time  seven seas may make certain statements that provide stockholders and the investing public with forward looking information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 
words such as anticipate  assume  believe  estimate  project  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing  including  but not limited to  in press releases  as part of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and as part of other sections of the company s filings with the sec under the securities act and the securities exchange act 
such forward looking statements may include  but not be limited to  statements concerning estimates of current and future results of operations  financial position  reserves  the timing and commencement of wells and development plans  drilling results as indicated by log analysis  core samples  examination of cuttings  hydrocarbons shows while drilling and production estimates from wells drilled based upon drill stem tests and other test data  future capacity under credit arrangements  future capital expenditures  liquidity requirements  liquidity sufficiency and year compliance 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including without limitation  those defined below 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should any of the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results of current and future operations may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
among the factors that have a direct bearing on seven seas results of operations and the oil and gas industry in which it operates are uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and gas reserves and future hydrocarbon production and cash flows  particularly with respect to wells that have not been fully tested and with wells having limited production testing histories  access to additional capital  changes in the price of oil and natural gas  services and equipment  the limited exploration of the concessions  the status of existing and future contractual relationships with ecopetrol  foreign currency fluctuation risks  seven seas substantial indebtedness  the presence of competitors with greater financial resources and capacity  and difficulties and risks associated with operating in colombia

as of december   ryder scott company petroleum engineers ryder scott estimated total proved recoverable reserves for the guaduas field of  bbls  of which  bbls were attributable to the company s interest 
the company currently plans to focus its resources on placing the guaduas field on production by increments in order to achieve cash flow as soon as possible and to take advantage of the expected low equipment  service and construction cost resulting from the oil and gas industry s current depressed state 
see item business strategy for guaduas field development and pipeline production 
first production from the guaduas field  increment i  should be achieved through the construction of a portable trucking facility ptf subsequently to become part of the permanent facilities for the trucking of between  bbls d and  bbls d to a local refinery located approximately miles from the guaduas field 
the estimated net capital cost to the company for these facilities is approximately million 
the company estimates that it can commence ptf production in early increment ii  early pipeline production  includes the construction of facilities for the production of  bbls d to  bbls d and is scheduled to go on line by year end increment ii facilities will include the construction of a mile pipeline that will connect with the existing regional oam pipeline 
contemporaneously  the company will drill additional development wells and one gas injection well 
the company estimates that the net capital cost of the pipeline  the production facilities and drilling the necessary wells will be approximately million 
the net cost of the pipeline is approximately million 
the company s unrestricted cash reserves as of december  were million and the company has obligatory capital expenditure commitments of million through year end see liquidity and capital resources 
whether the company can achieve the increment i and ii objectives on schedule and with the company s existing capital resources is dependant upon a number of factors  many of which are not within its control  such as timely environmental permitting  securing pipeline rights of way  obtaining ecopetrol s agreement to commerciality under the association contracts and timely payments by the co participants of their share of these costs as well as the market price of oil field equipment and services 
if the company experiences delays or cost overruns  which must be considered possible  the company will seek other sources of financing  including project financing  industry joint ventures or like arrangements with industry service companies  commercial bank borrowings and traditional debt and equity financing 
the company s expenditures for increment ii  early pipeline production  may be substantially reduced by the formation of a separate company to construct the guaduas pipeline connecting to the oam regional pipeline to be owned and financed by third parties and in which the company may have little or no equity  thereby obligating the company to pay only a per barrel tariff on its oil transported through the pipeline and none of the capital expenditures that are currently budgeted by the company for the construction of the pipeline 
furthermore  the company will be required to obtain additional sources of financing to meet its other  multiple objectives of accelerating incremental production from the guaduas field beyond increment ii and delineation and exploratory drilling see item properties colombian properties guaduas field strategy for the development of oil production by increments and further exploration 
each additional increment of field production increments iii through v will require additional production facilities  a pipeline expansion  the expansion of proved oil reserves through successful development and delineation drilling of the shallow cimarrona reservoir 
if external financing is obtained  the company would anticipate drilling a delineation well on the west flank of the guaduas structure and an exploration well to test the deep guaduas field structure  depending on certain actions by ecopetrol see review of activities concerning the effects of unanticipated events on prior company plans 
the company also plans to participate in the drilling of an exploratory well on the tapir block and to conduct seismic operations on the rosablanca and montecristo blocks during at an aggregate cost of million 
review of activities the company s plan to develop the guaduas field  as outlined in its form k for the year ended december   called for the drilling of seven wells in and the first half of  at a then estimated net cost of million  and the building of a pipeline and production facilities to produce initially  bbls d at an estimated net cost of million 
in  management estimated that the company could have the guaduas field on production during due to a number of circumstances  however  first pipeline production is now estimated to commence year end at a rate of  bbls d to  bbls d 
the principal circumstances contributing to delays were delays caused by mechanical difficulties of both drilling and completion operations  longer than anticipated production testing of wells  commerciality negotiations with ecopetrol  the need to replace the entire senior management of the company s colombian subsidiary  ghkcc and terminate the company s bogota based engineering consultants  and a decision by the colombian supreme court that declared the established environmental global permitting laws to be unconstitutional  resulting in the promulgation of new environmental laws and standards 
as a result of the aforementioned circumstances and resulting delays  the company actually drilled six wells and completed and extensively tested three wells during with a net cost of approximately million for drilling and approximately million for completion and testing 
none of the three wells tested in were successful 
management believes that oil and gas shows encountered in the drilling of two of the delineation wells that did not produce during testing coupled with log and core data taken from these wells  which was generally similar to the data from the other productive wells  suggests that test production failure may have been a result of engineering and completion problems 
for this reason  el segundo e and tres pasos w are potential candidates for horizontal or lateral drilling in management believes that in spite of the setbacks in  that the substantial amount of production testing and engineering studies and pressure and reservoir analysis performed during the year significantly improved the company s understanding of the guaduas field and its cimarrona reservoir 
additionally the company completed its first d seismic survey covering the north half of the guaduas structure 
use of the data recorded should lead to better locations for future development and delineation wells 
further  the company drilled and completed the first guaduas field horizontal well in late production testing began in early and unstimulated production rates of  bbls d to  bbls d indicate a commercial well with potential to produce at higher rates  however  the final results will not be known until the completion of reservoir stimulation and testing at multiple  higher rates  which are expected to take place during the second quarter of the company also moved operational control of the guaduas field from houston to bogota and hired a team of oil professionals see item business employees with extensive international experience in the development of large oil fields  production facilities and pipelines to take the place of independent engineering consultants 
as a result of the company s extensive production testing and reservoir analysis performed by the company s professionals  as well as servipetrol ltd 
and ryder scott  the estimation of the guaduas field s total proved reserves increased by  bbls  or by  from  bbls to  bbls 
the net increase for the company was  or  bbls  bringing the company s total proved reserves to  from  bbls 
the pre tax net present value of the company s proved oil reserves  discounted at  decreased by  to  from  over the same period 
the decrease is the result of an oil price decrease over the period from to  a change to the year in the expected commencement of pipeline production  and the increase in the company s net proved reserves of  bbls 
the reduction in oil price was a factor in the write down of the company s oil and gas properties in the pre tax amount of million after tax million see results of development stage operations 
in summary  management believes that  without unforeseen cost overruns or further delays and with additional delineation drilling  completion and reservoir knowledge  and the use of d seismic and horizontal drilling employed by the company s new professional team  that the company will be able to carry the strategies described herein in a timely manner 
liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of million  net of restricted investments  and unrestricted cash resources of million as of december  the company s unrestricted cash resources as of february  are million 
the company s non discretionary capital commitments for the remainder of as of february  are approximately the company s activities from its inception through december  were funded primarily by the proceeds from private placements of the company s securities  including the company s common shares  warrants and notes  resulting in aggregate cash proceeds of million

ii senior notes 
in may  the company completed the offering of million of senior notes due may  the senior notes and received net proceeds of approximately million  of which approximately million has been held in a separate account or in escrow to provide for the first three years of interest payable under the senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on may and november of each year  commencing november  the senior notes mature on may  the senior notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at any time on or after may   at the prescribed redemption price  plus accrued and unpaid interest  liquidated damages and additional amounts  if any  to the date of redemption 
notwithstanding the foregoing  at any time prior to may   the company may redeem up to of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with a portion of the net proceeds of an equity or strategic investor offering  provided that at least of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption 
the senior notes may also be redeemed at the option of the company  in whole but not in part  at any time at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest  liquidated damages and additional amounts  if any  to the redemption date in the event of certain changes affecting withholding taxes applicable to certain payments on the senior notes 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  i unless the company redeems the senior notes as provided in clause ii below  the company will be required to offer to purchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to of the aggregate principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  liquidated damages and additional amounts  if any  to the date of purchase  and ii the company will have the option  at any time prior to may   to redeem the senior notes  in whole but not in part at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus the applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest  liquidated damages and additional amounts  if any  to the date of redemption

in  the company acquired an additional in the dindal and rio seco association contracts in colombia in exchange for the issuance of the company s common shares valued at million in the aggregate at that time 
in  the company acquired an additional in the dindal and rio seco association contracts in colombia in exchange for the issuance of the company s common shares valued at million in the aggregate at that time 
from inception through december   the company had capital expenditures of million for the acquisition  exploration  and development of its oil and gas properties including million with respect to its interests in colombia 
the company s estimated capital expenditures assume in each case that each of the associates in the association contracts approves and pays its proportionate share of capital expenditures 
under the terms of the association contracts  if a commercially feasible discovery is made  the colombian national oil company ecopetrol may acquire a interest in the property  and the interests of all other parties to the contract  including the company  will be reduced by 
ecopetrol will bear of the associated development costs and will reimburse the other associates for of certain exploration activities 
the association contracts require ecopetrol s participation in the production facilities 
the company expects that ecopetrol will participate to the extent of of the pipeline and infrastructure costs 
no assurances can be given  however  that an agreement will be reached on these terms and the company may be required to fund amounts greater than the amounts presented as the company s net share 
ecopetrol retains the right not to participate initially in the development 
in this case  the associates can develop the guaduas field under a sole risk provision  and will be required to invest of the development costs 
after the associates have recovered of the costs invested for development plus of certain exploration costs  ecopetrol will become a participant in the project at a interest see business properties terms of association contracts and related matters 
total capital expenditures on the company s non operated tapir association contract area are estimated to be million 
such expenditures will be made to complete the mateguafa well  which was drilled in  and to drill one more exploratory wells on the block 
to date  all oil revenues have been due to the company s share of crude oil produced during production testing of the company s wells on the guaduas field 
although the company intends to continue to sell oil resulting from production tests  significant commercial production is not expected until further development of the field through the drilling and re drilling and completion of additional wells and construction of production and pipeline transportation facilities 
the company has completed plans for the construction of pipeline and production facilities at the guaduas field 
permitting and the purchasing of equipment and supplies for pipeline and production facilities are now proceeding 
anticipated completion of increment ii at  bbls d to  bbls d is year end see item properties colombian properties guaduas field strategy for the development of oil production by increments and further exploration 
the company plans to conduct seismic operations on the montecristo and rosablanca association contract areas in for an estimated cost of million 
the company is considering acquisition of outside funding via farm out or forming an alliance with a seismic contractor to complete this work 
either of these events will result in a reduction of the company s interest 
australia 
the company is in the process of eliminating any mandatory capital commitments outside of colombia 
in the bass strait basin offshore southeast australia  the company is seeking to farm out its interests 
if the company does not farm out its interests in this prospect and an exploratory well is drilled during  the company will have an estimated million capital commitment for this prospect during in  the company completed the sale of its working interest in the perth basin in western australia for approximately million in cash and the reimbursement of approximately million for certain capital expenditures 
papua new guinea 
the company entered into an agreement with arco papua new guinea inc arco for a farm out of its interest whereby arco funded the company s obligation for the twelve month period ended july for an interest in the subject exploration permit 
subsequently  the company relinquished its rights in the property to arco  retaining a small production payment 
the company has no remaining required capital expenditures 
accounting policies and development stage accounting the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the company s exploration and development activities have not generated a substantial amount of revenue  thus requiring the financial statements to be presented as a development stage enterprise 
accumulated losses are presented on the balance sheet as deficit accumulated during the development stage 
the income statement presents revenues and expenses for each period presented and also a cumulative total of both amounts from the company s inception 
the statement of cash flows shows inflows and outflows for each period presented and from the company s inception 
the statement of stockholders equity presents the date and number of shares of each class of security issued for cash or other consideration and the dollar amount assigned 
in addition  the notes to consolidated financial statements are required to identify the enterprise as development stage 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized in separate cost centers for each country 
such capitalized costs include contract and concession acquisition  geological  geophysical and other exploration work  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  constructing production facilities and pipelines  and other related costs 
as of december   unevaluated oil and gas interests included capitalized general and administrative costs of million 
no additional general and administrative costs were capitalized during and the company capitalized interest of million and million in and  respectively 
the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in each cost center are amortized on the composite units of production method based on future gross revenues from proved reserves 
sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are normally accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs 
gain or loss is not recognized in income unless a significant portion of a cost center s reserves are involved 
capitalized costs associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until it is determined whether proved reserves can be assigned to such properties or until the value of the properties is impaired 
if the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in a cost center exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves in the cost center and the lower of cost or fair value of properties not being amortized  both adjusted for income tax effects  such excess is charged to expense 
as of december   the company s exploration and development activities have not generated significant revenues 
as a result  the company s historical results of operations have been presented as a development stage company  thus  period to period comparisons of such results and certain financial data may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
in this regard  future results of the company will be highly dependent upon the success of the company s guaduas field operations 
results of development stage operations to date  oil revenues and lease operating expenses pertained solely to the company s share of crude oil produced during production testing of the company s wells in the guaduas field 
revenues from oil sales were 
million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
lease operating expenses were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the company tested four wells in and two wells in the oil and gas operating expenses represent such costs as tank rentals and other miscellaneous fixed costs 
oil production in colombia net to the company  including minority interest of  barrels   barrels and  barrels in   and  respectively  pertaining solely to the company s share of oil produced from production testing  was sold to ecopetrol at an average price of per barrel in  per barrel in  and per barrel in production in was substantially lower than in because the company s testing program required that the wells be shut in for pressure build up tests during much of the year in january  production testing began again from the tres pasos w horizontal and will be conducted throughout much of the first quarter of the year 
later in the company plans additional production testing 
interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase from to was the consequence of higher cash and investment balances resulting from the issuance of the senior notes in may the increase from to was the consequence of higher cash balances resulting from the issuance of million of exchangeable notes in august general and administrative costs were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the costs incurred during included approximately million of severance and million of related compensation costs associated with the resignation of former officers 
the costs incurred during included million relating to costs incurred conducting feasibility studies for the proposed construction of pipeline and production facilities and other development activities in colombia 
the remaining million increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel costs  including salaries  benefits  travels  rents  and insurance due to increased personnel in both the us and colombia as well as the expansion of operations in colombia 
in addition  the company incurred million in professional services and consulting fees and accrued million for certain commitments and contingencies 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to severance costs paid to former executive officers and recognition of compensation expense related to a change in the exercise period of stock options held by such executives 
in addition  the company expanded its operating activities and significantly added to its professional staff in the us and colombia 
depreciation and amortization was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to the amortization of costs incurred on the issue of the senior notes in may and the exchangeable notes in august see liquidity and capital resources 
the remaining increase resulted from higher depreciation costs relating to the increase in fixed assets 
as of december   the company has not recorded depletion of its proved oil and gas property as only insignificant quantities of oil have been produced during its production testing plan 
as required under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized costs are limited to the sum of the present value of future net revenues using current unescalated pricing discounted at related to estimated production of proved reserves and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unevaluated properties  all net of expected income tax effects 
at december   the company recognized a non cash write down of oil and gas properties in the amount of million pre tax or million after tax pursuant to this ceiling limitation required by the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
the write down was primarily the result of the decline in crude oil prices and the impairment of unevaluated properties due primarily to the failure of five non commercial exploratory wells 
the company incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the loss includes a non cash write down of million pre tax or million after tax 
colombian taxes the company s net income  as defined under colombian law  from colombian sources is subject to colombian corporate income tax at a rate of 
an additional remittance tax is imposed upon remittance of profits abroad at a rate of 
year disclosure the year issue is a general term used to refer to certain business implications of the arrival of the new millennium 
in simple terms  on january   all hardware and software systems which use the two digit year convention could fail completely or create erroneous data as a result of the system failing to recognize the two digit internal date as representing the year the company does not believe that its internal systems and operations have any material issues with respect to year compliance and does not anticipate incurring significant remediation costs  if any 
the company has a limited operating history and is engaged solely in the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas in colombia 
as such  the company engages in few transactions and has minimum reliance on the hardware and software systems of third parties 
further  the company s hardware and software systems are relatively new  widely utilized and the company has been advised that all of these systems are year compliant 
the company s internal dependence on information systems and other operating equipment that could potentially require remedial action to become year compliant is low 
accordingly  the risk of operation disruptions and the corresponding risk of liability for disruptions caused by non year compliant systems are not of major concern to the company 
one of the next phases in the development of the guaduas field is the transportation and marketing of crude oil to be produced from the company s properties 
the company is engaged in negotiations with oil pipeline  construction and engineering firms to construct its processing  storage and related facilities and a mile pipeline from the guaduas field to the existing oleoducto alto magdalena oam pipeline  which terminates at vasconia 
beyond vasconia  the company s oil production may be transported to the export terminal at covenas via the two existing pipeline systems  oleducto de colombia odc 
the company has retained brown root energy services and technivance brown root sa to conduct planning and engineering studies for its planned pipeline and associated compression facilities from the guaduas field and intends that the technology employed in its own delivery systems will be year compliant 
the company has also asked these consultants to review any year risks associated with the planned interconnection of its delivery systems with the oam  odc and ocensa pipelines  and is reviewing the oam delivery systems in conjunction with its current negotiations with the operator of that pipeline 
the company or the consultants will review and  where necessary  rectify the year risks associated with interconnections to the oam and odc pipelines 
the company is not currently aware of year limitations affecting the computer systems that control these third party pipeline systems that would compromise the operation of such systems 
moreover  the company would not be responsible for remediation costs associated with such computer systems should any technical problems arise 
however  in the event a pipeline was rendered inoperable as a result of year issues affecting its operating systems  the company may be required to rely on less efficient alternate delivery systems  such as tanker trucks  to transport any oil production to market 
as the company develops its infrastructure at the guaduas field  it will continue to monitor year compliance issues as they relate to equipment supplied by its vendors and contractors 
since the company does not currently supply significant oil production to its customers  and no supply contracts have been entered into in respect of the guaduas field production  the company is unable to assess the significance of year issues affecting potential customers at this stage in its operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk seven seas is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity risk 
the company s exposure in the commodity pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas production is currently minimal due to the small amounts of oil and gas produced to date 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing are expected to be minor until such time as the company produces commercial quantities of oil and gas 
interest rate risk 
the company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of a fixed interest rate on the million senior notes 
the company currently has no open interest rate swaps agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company conducts business in several foreign currencies and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses and capital expenditures 
however  because predominately all transactions in seven seas existing foreign operations are denominated in us dollars  the us dollar is the functional currency for all operations 
exposure from transactions in currencies other than the us dollars is not material
