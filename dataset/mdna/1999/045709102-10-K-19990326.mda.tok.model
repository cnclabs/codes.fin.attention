item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
the company consists of two operating divisions  alside and amercable 
in addition  amercord  a owned affiliate  is accounted for using the equity method 
the company s results of operations are primarily affected by the operating results of alside  which accounted for more than of the company s net sales in each of the last three years 
because its residential building products are consumer durable goods  alside s sales are impacted by the availability of consumer credit  consumer interest rates  employment trends  changes in levels of consumer confidence  national and regional trends in new housing starts and general economic conditions 
alside s sales are also affected by changes in consumer preferences with respect to types of building products 
alside s products are used in the repair and remodeling  as well as the new construction  sectors of the building industry 
for each of the three years in the period ended december   alside believes that its sales were made primarily to the repair and remodeling sector 
the company believes that vinyl building products will continue to gain market share from metal and wood products due to vinyl s favorable attributes  which include its durability  lower maintenance cost and lower cost compared to wood and metal 
although no assurances can be given  the company further believes that these increases in market share  together with alside s increased marketing efforts  will increase alside s sales of vinyl siding  vinyl windows and other complementary building products 
the company operates with substantial operating and financial leverage 
significant portions of alside s selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales 
as a result  a percentage change in alside s net sales will have a greater percentage effect on alside s income from operations 
in addition  interest expense related to the company s long term debt is relatively fixed 
amercable 
amercable modified its business strategy in to focus on a core group of cable products that amercable believed better utilized its manufacturing efficiencies and marketing and distribution capabilities 
as a result of this strategy  amercable has lowered its costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies and on time delivery rates  thereby substantially improving its profitability 
amercord 
as anticipated  amercord s average unit selling prices decreased in due to increased competitive pressures 
amercord made improvements in its manufacturing efficiency during however  these improvements only partially offset the decline in average selling prices 
the company anticipates amercord s average selling prices will decline slightly in as a result  the company does not anticipate that amercord will earn a profit in prior to  amercord had satisfied its working capital and capital expenditure requirements from internally generated funds and its existing credit facilities 
during  the company and ivaco each made a  capital contribution to amercord 
in addition  the company has guaranteed up to million of certain borrowings under amercord s bank credit facility 
in late  the company announced that it intended to seek to sell its interest in amercord 
the company recorded a million writedown on its investment in amercord in the writedown was determined based upon bids received from interested parties 
the company presently anticipates it will be able to sell its interest in amercord in the second quarter of segment data 
alside accounted for more than of the company s net sales and income from operations in each of the three years in the period ended december  in  alside accounted for approximately of the company s income from operations exclusive of corporate selling  general and administrative expenses

quarterly financial data general 
because most of alside s building products are intended for exterior use  alside s sales and operating profits tend to be lower during periods of inclement weather 
weather conditions in the first quarter of each calendar year historically result in that quarter producing significantly less sales revenue than in any other period of the year 
as a result  the company has historically had losses in the first quarter and reduced profits in the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to the significant impact of alside on the company s performance 
quarterly sales and operating profit data for the company in and are shown in the table below three months ended march june september december in thousands  except per share amounts net sales alside     net sales amercable     total net sales     gross profit     income from operations    income loss before extraordinary item     basic earnings loss per common share diluted earnings loss per common share net sales alside     net sales amercable     total net sales     gross profit     income from operations     income loss before extraordinary item    basic earnings loss per common share before extraordinary item diluted earnings loss per common share before extraordinary item in accordance with the commission staff accounting bulletin  topic d  shares of common stock issued during the month period prior to the company s initial public offering at prices below the initial public offering price have been included in the calculation as if these shares were outstanding for all periods presented

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increased operating cash flows in were due to improved operating performance at alside and amercable  as well as lower working capital requirements in as compared to the increased operating cash flows in were due primarily to an increase in net income due to improved operating performance at alside and amercable  as well as lower working capital requirements in as compared to in april  the company amended and restated the credit agreement to increase the facility to permit borrowings of up to million and to extend the term to may  the company believes it has the ability to renew its credit agreement 
available borrowings under the credit agreement are limited to the lesser of the total facility less unused letters of credit or availability based on percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets other than the company s owned real property and its shares of amercord 
at december   million of this facility had been used to issue a million letter of credit securing the company s taxable variable rate notes the taxable notes as well as million securing various insurance letters of credit and million securing a letter of credit to guarantee up to million of amercord s borrowing facility 
at december  the company had an available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement of approximately million 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
expenditures in were primarily used to increase window welding and assembly capacity and to increase vinyl siding extrusion and blending capacity including the construction of a new vinyl siding manufacturing plant 
the company began construction on this new million vinyl siding facility in august the company expects that this facility will become operational in the second quarter of capital expenditures on the new vinyl siding manufacturing plant were million in due to the delay in starting construction  a portion of the capital expenditures planned for will be incurred in expenditures in were primarily used to increase vinyl extrusion capacity for siding  windows and fencing as well as to increase and automate window fabrication capacity 
expenditures in were primarily used to increase alside s capacity to produce welded vinyl windows  enhance the company s window tooling design capability  continue automating its window assembly process  and increase vinyl window extrusion capacity 
the company has historically funded these capital expenditure requirements out of cash generated from operating activities or borrowings under its bank credit facility 
the company believes that capital expenditures prior to represent a base level of spending needed to maintain its vinyl siding and vinyl window production equipment as well as provide for modest increases in plant productivity and operating capacity 
presently anticipated capital expenditures for of million includes million for the completion of the new vinyl siding manufacturing facility  as well as expenditures to increase extrusion capacity for window profiles and vinyl fence 
approximately million of the capital expenditures have been allocated to amercable  primarily to increase production flexibility and capacity by 
in march  the company completed a tender offer and consent solicitation with respect to its notes 
in the tender offer  the company purchased million of the million notes 
simultaneously with the consummation of the tender offer  the company issued million of notes 
concurrently with these transactions  the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock of which  shares were sold by the company 
the remaining  shares were sold by certain of the company s stockholders  including the holder of the class b common stock who converted  shares of class b common stock into common stock on a one to one basis in connection with the offering 
net proceeds to the company  after underwriting discounts and offering expenses  from the common stock and note offerings were million and million  respectively 
the company redeemed the million principal amount of notes that remained outstanding in august amercord is not in compliance with certain financial covenants under its existing bank credit agreement 
amercord has entered into a forbearance agreement pursuant to which the lender has agreed not to exercise certain rights under the credit agreement through march   subject to certain conditions 
amercord is currently negotiating with the lender to extend the forbearance agreement to june  in connection with the forbearance agreement  the company and ivaco  inc each made a  capital contribution to amercord 
in addition  the company has guaranteed up to  of borrowings under amercord s credit agreement 
effective october   the company established an employee stock purchase plan espp 
employees participating in the espp can purchase shares of common stock at a discount to fair market value through payroll deductions of up to of their eligible compensation 
the company registered  shares of common stock with the securities and exchange commission sec in september for issuance pursuant to the espp 
in  the company issued  shares of common stock pursuant to espp resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately  on october  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to  shares of common stock in open market transactions depending on market  economic and other factors 
the company had repurchased  shares of common stock under this program at december  the company believes the future cash flows from operations and its borrowing capacity under its existing credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy its obligations to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt  maintain current operations  provide sufficient capital for presently anticipated capital expenditures and fund its stock repurchase program 
however  there can be no assurances that the cash so generated by the company will be sufficient for these purposes 
year historically  computer programs have used a two digit format rather than a four digit format to refer to the year 
after the year  these computer programs will not recognize the year correctly which may cause the computer application to fail or to process data incorrectly 
state of readiness 
the company began its year program in in order to ensure all systems were year compliant 
the company s alside division divided its year information technology it project as follows mainframe  as systems  manufacturing systems and pc systems 
alside has reviewed its mainframe and as systems and believes all date fields have been corrected 
all mission critical programs within its mainframe have been tested and are believed to be year compliant 
the mission critical programs include the general ledger  accounts payable  billing receivable and payroll 
updates to alside s manufacturing systems were completed in the first quarter of alside has established a task force consisting of representatives from information services and each of the manufacturing facilities to review the status of its pc systems 
the task force identified several non critical issues that will be addressed by the second quarter of the company s amercable division believes its it systems are year compliant 
alside and amercable are currently assessing and updating their non it systems 
the company s alside and amercable divisions are currently contacting significant customers and suppliers to assess year compliance and readiness 
approximately of the questionnaires sent to suppliers have been returned 
the company is currently contacting suppliers who have not responded to the questionnaire 
based upon the responses received  it appears the company s suppliers are aware of the year issue and are taking the necessary steps to ensure year compliance 
the company will continue to monitor and evaluate the responses to determine the possible risks that may affect the company s operations 
costs 
to date  the company s costs to address year issues have not been material 
the company s alside division designs the majority of its application systems in house 
the process of reviewing the in house systems and converting date sensitive fields was done by alside s computer programmers as part of routine system maintenance 
alside has retained an independent consultant to assist with year compliance for its manufacturing systems 
alside has spent approximately  to update its manufacturing system 
based upon the review of the pc systems task force  alside estimates it will spend approximately  in to upgrade certain hardware and software systems 
the company s amercable division installed a new information system in that is year compliant 
amercable s system acquisition was not accelerated due to year and is therefore not considered as part of the year expenditures 
company risks and contingency plan 
the company believes that its most significant remaining year risk is associated with its customers and suppliers 
once the company completes its customer and supplier readiness evaluation it will be better able to formulate a contingency plan 
the company believes its customers will not be significantly impacted by the year due to the nature of the home improvement business 
effects of inflation the company believes that the effects of inflation on its operations have not been material during the past three years 
inflation could adversely affect the company if inflation results in significantly higher interest rates or substantial weakness in economic conditions 
alside s principal raw material  vinyl resin  has been subject to rapid price changes 
although alside has historically been able to pass on price increases to its customers  during and alside did not generally pass on any additional costs or savings resulting from changes in resin prices 
no assurances can be given that alside will be able to pass on any price increases in the future 
financial accounting standards in june the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that a company recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company believes this statement will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
certain forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of  and estimates and assumptions made by and information currently available to  the company s management 
when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  and similar words  as they relate to the company or the company s management  identify forward looking statements 
these statements reflect the current views of the company s management regarding the operations and results of operations of the company as well as its customers and suppliers 
these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
certain factors that might cause a difference are discussed below 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur  or should management s assumptions or estimates prove incorrect  actual results and events may vary materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
general industry  economic  interest rates and other conditions 
the exterior residential building products industry in which alside operates may be significantly affected by changes in national and local economic and other conditions  including employment levels  changing demographic considerations  availability of financing  interest rates and consumer confidence  all of which are outside of the company s control 
a prolonged recession affecting the residential construction industry could result in a significant decrease in the company s financial performance 
substantial fixed costs 
a significant portion of alside s selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed costs which do not fluctuate proportionately with sales 
as a result  a percentage decline in alside s net sales has a greater percentage effect on alside s operating income 
changing raw material costs and availability 
the principal raw material used in producing alside s vinyl products is vinyl resin  which historically has changed significantly in price 
although alside has generally been able to pass on price increases in vinyl resin to its customers  there can be no assurance that in the future the market will respond favorably to selling price increases or that the company will otherwise be able to absorb these cost increases without significantly affecting its margins 
additionally  a major interruption in the delivery of vinyl resin to alside would disrupt alside s operations and could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
alside has contracts with two vendors to supply substantially all of its vinyl resin requirements and believes its requirements could also be met by other suppliers 
copper is the principal raw material used by amercable in the manufacture of its products 
historically  copper has been subject to rapid price changes 
a decrease in the price of copper may also affect the company s gross margins as amercable generally prices its cable products based on market prices for copper at the time of shipment 
as a result  sudden decreases in copper prices can result in lower gross profit margins in future periods 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report 
substantial financial leverage 
the company has substantial financial leverage 
as of december   the company s total indebtedness was approximately million and its stockholders equity was million 
the company s high level of indebtedness presents certain risks to its security holders and could adversely affect  among other things  the ability of the company to obtain additional financing in the future and to respond to market and general economic conditions  extraordinary capital requirements and other factors 
the company s bank credit agreement includes covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and net worth 
this credit agreement also restricts the company s ability to repurchase its common stock and to pay dividends 
outstanding borrowings under the bank credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
in addition  the indenture under which the company s notes were issued contains covenants that  among other things  limits the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make certain investments and repurchase stock or subordinated indebtedness 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in this report 
risks relating to manufacturing expansion 
the company started construction of a new vinyl siding manufacturing facility in the company expects this facility to start production in the second quarter of the construction of a new facility involves certain risks  including construction cost overruns and delays  the hiring and training of new employees  compliance with environmental health and safety and other regulatory requirements and the costs associated with the purchase of new production equipment  tooling and other machinery 
the inability of the company to start commercial production at its new manufacturing facility in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  when the company commences production at this new facility  it could experience lower than anticipated manufacturing efficiencies that may adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully integrate this new facility with its existing manufacturing facilities or that it will achieve the anticipated benefits and efficiencies from its expanded manufacturing operations 
in addition  the company s operating results could be adversely affected if sales of the company s products do not increase at a rate sufficient to offset the company s increased expenses resulting from this expansion 
see item business manufacturing in this report 
weather impacts quarterly results 
because most of alside s building products are intended for exterior use  sales tend to be lower during periods of inclement weather 
weather conditions in the first quarter of each calendar year usually result in that quarter producing significantly less sales revenue than in any other period of the year 
consequently  the company has historically had net losses in the first quarter and reduced profits from operations in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quarterly financial data in this report 
competition from other vinyl building product manufacturers and alternative building product materials 
with the exception of owens corning  no other company within the vinyl residential siding market competes with alside in both manufacturing and distribution 
however  alside does compete with other manufacturers of vinyl building products  including aluminum company of america  certainteed corporation  jannock limited  nortek  inc and royal group technologies limited 
some of these companies are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
the company also competes with owens corning and numerous large and small distributors of building products in its capacity as a distributor of these products 
additionally  the company s products face competition from alternative materials wood and aluminum in the window markets  and wood  masonry and metal in the siding market 
there can be no assurance the company will not be adversely impacted by its competitors or alternative materials 
see item business alside competition in this report 
costs of environmental compliance 
the company s operations are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including laws and regulations addressing materials used in the manufacturing of the company s products 
in addition  certain of the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
future expenditures may be necessary as compliance standards and technology change 
unforeseen significant expenditures required to maintain compliance  including unforeseen liabilities  could have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition

see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in this report 
item a 
disclosures about market risk 
interest rate risk the company had million in short term investments at december  the short term investments are highly liquid with original maturities of less than three months and are subject to interest rate risk 
the value of these investments would decline in the event of increases in market interest rates 
the company generally holds these investments until maturity thus avoiding the losses resulting from sudden changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates would reduce the amount of the company s interest income 
the company borrows under its revolving credit facility from time to time for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at either the prime commercial rate or libor plus at the option of the company 
therefore  the company is also subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of the terms of this credit facility 
at december   the company had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
at december   the company had million of taxable variable rate notes with interest payable monthly at the greater of the or day commercial paper rate plus 
these notes mature on april  although the company is subject to interest rate fluctuations  changes in the interest rate in the upcoming months would not be material as it relates to the taxable notes as the interest is paid monthly and the remaining balance is due in early the company has million of senior subordinated notes due that bear a fixed interest rate of 
the fair value of the company s notes is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company has periodically entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
at december   the company had no interest rate swaps 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company s revenues are primarily from domestic customers and are realized in us dollars 
accordingly  the company believes its direct foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material 
in the past  the company has hedged against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on specific sales or equipment purchasing contracts 
at december  the company had currency hedges in place in connection with equipment purchases 
however  the amounts involved are not material to the company 
commodity price risk copper is one of the primary raw materials used by its amercable division 
the company from time to time uses forward contracts as a hedge against changes in copper prices for specific contracts 
at december   no raw material forward contracts were in place 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain forward looking statements changing raw material costs and availability in this report
