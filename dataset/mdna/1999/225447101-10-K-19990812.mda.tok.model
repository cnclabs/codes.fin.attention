overview we are the world leaders in developing and manufacturing semiconductor materials and electronic devices made from sic 
we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment or in accordance with the terms of the relevant contract 
we recognize the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue and green led products 
we offer leds at two brightness levels high brightness blue and green products and standard blue products 
our led devices are utilized by end users for automotive backlighting  lcd backlighting including wireless handsets  indicator lamps  miniature white lighting  indoor sign and arena displays  outdoor full color stadium displays  traffic signals and other lighting applications 
led products represented of our revenue in fiscal and in fiscal we also derive revenue from the sale of advanced materials made from sic that are used primarily for research and development 
we also sell sic crystals to c  which incorporates them in gemstone applications 
during late fiscal and fiscal  c purchased equipment from us  which has more than doubled the capacity for the production of crystals for c sales of advanced materials made from sic represented of our revenue in fiscal and approximately during fiscal the balance of our revenue  for fiscal and for fiscal is derived from government contract funding 
under various programs  us government entities further the development of our technology by supplementing our research and development efforts 
all resulting technology remains our property after the completion of the contract  subject to certain license rights retained by the government 
contract revenue includes funding of direct research and development costs and a portion of our general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses for contracts under which we expect funding to exceed direct costs over the life of the contract 
for contracts under which we anticipate that direct costs will exceed amounts to be funded over the life of the contract ie  certain cost share arrangements  we report direct costs as research and development expenses with related reimbursements recorded as an offset to those expenses 
in june  cree announced the first of a family of rf and microwave transistor products made from sic and designed for use in a variety of power amplification processes 
a second phase of transistor products is expected to be available in fiscal the company expects that these products will be marketed to a variety of amplifier producers  including wireless base stations and digital broadcast applications 
while distribution of samples will commence in early fiscal  during fiscal the company believes that these products will be sold in limited quantities as design cycles for the target applications are generally several months 
there can be no assurance that customers will be able to develop applications in the near future that will require commercial production of the company s rf products or that such products will be successful in the market

gross margin operating expenses research and development 
sales  general and administrative other expense income from operations interest income  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue revenue grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was attributable to higher product revenue  which rose from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase in product revenue was a result of the rise in sales of our led products and increase in materials revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  respectively 
growth in led volume resulted from the introduction of the new high brightness devices and improvements in the product design of and strong demand for the standard brightness product 
while we continue to improve our manufacturing process and yields on our high brightness products  we must continue to significantly increase our production output to meet the growing demands of our customers 
we believe that our led products are particularly attractive to the marketplace due to our low prices and industry standard vertical structure 
during fiscal  led volume grew while average sales prices declined 
we expect that in order to increase market demand for all of our led products  we must continue to lower average sales prices  although pricing is anticipated to be more stable in fiscal year than prior years 
historically  we have been successful in matching lower sales prices with lower costs 
during fiscal  we plan to focus on reducing costs through higher production yields and from greater volumes as fixed costs are spread over a greater number of units 
in september  we entered into an agreement with siemens where siemens agreed to purchase our blue led chips 
in december  this agreement was amended to provide for additional shipments of led products through september and was assigned to an indirect subsidiary of siemens  osram opto semiconductors gmbh co 
osram  effective as of january  this contract calls for declining prices based on an increase in the number of units shipped 
this pricing structure is common with customers in the semiconductor industry and prior agreements with siemens 
siemens including its osram subsidiary accounted for of our revenue for fiscal and in fiscal we are currently negotiating a new purchase agreement with osram 
our high brightness led products  which were introduced during fiscal  continue to be ramped up to high volume production in our manufacturing facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue from high brightness products made up more than of total led revenue 
we believe sales from these products will surpass our standard brightness product during fiscal year  however  there can be no assurance that the product volume will increase or yield improvements will be made to do so 
revenue attributable to sales of sic material was higher in fiscal than in the same period of fiscal due to a significant increase in sales to c for gemstone applications and strong demand for wafer products 
during fiscal  c was in initial stages of operation  therefore  unit sales were limited 
revenue from sales of sic wafers were higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to quality improvements in wafers  along with the availability of the larger two inch wafer during fiscal during fiscal  sales from our displays business declined from the prior year period as we have chosen to discontinue this product line 
contract revenue received from us government agencies also declined during fiscal compared to fiscal  as a significant contract that funded optoelectronic research was exhausted in early fiscal we anticipate contract revenue to increase slightly in fiscal as additional contract awards have been received in late fiscal gross profit gross margin climbed to of revenue during fiscal as compared to during fiscal this increase is predominantly attributable to design and manufacturing improvements that occurred over the past year resulting in significant reductions in cost 
with the introduction of the new conductive buffer led technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were able to significantly lower costs of production due to fewer manufacturing steps required with the new chip structure and improved yield 
during the first six months of fiscal  we introduced a smaller led chip size and  in december  we began to fabricate devices on a larger two inch wafer 
during much of fiscal  we were still in the process of establishing these new manufacturing designs and had not achieved production efficiency 
in addition  the larger two inch wafer had not been in full production for much of fiscal  therefore  average die yields were significantly lower 
during fiscal  margins realized on the high brightness products were lower than those derived from our standard blue led product  as the yield from the manufacturing process was less than our standard product 
historically  we have experienced lower margins with many new product introductions 
while we continue to make improvements to output and yield  the high brightness products may continue to pressure margins in the short term if we are not able to meet our yield objectives 
average wafer costs for sic material sales also declined during fiscal over the comparative period due to more efficient processes and improved yield 
research and development research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal much of this increase was caused by significantly higher costs for the initial development of the new high brightness led products 
in may of  the company signed a million agreement with mvis for the development of edge emitting leds and blue laser diodes 
as development costs are incurred under this contract  funding from mvis is offset against these expenses 
during fiscal  approximately million of funding from mvis was offset against research and development expenses 
the remaining million of funding is anticipated to be applied to research and development expenses in fiscal we expect that including the offset of mvis funds in fiscal  research and development expenses will remain relatively stable compared to fiscal amounts 
sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in the fiscal due primarily to the general growth in our business 
in addition  in fiscal two insurance events were recorded that reduced expenses by million 
as a result of the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit in november  we were reimbursed million for costs incurred in connection with the lawsuit 
most of these expenses were recorded in fiscal in addition  we received a million reimbursement of medical expenses due to a negotiated cost cap in a partially self funded insured health plan 
also as a result of our increased profitability during fiscal over fiscal  the profit sharing accrual which was based on of operating income has grown million 
we anticipate that total sales  general and administrative costs will increase in connection with the growth of our business  however  we believe that as a percentage of revenue they will remain constant or possibly decline 
other expense other expense increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  we realized impairments to leasehold costs as a result of management s decision to move equipment from our leased facility to our new manufacturing site 
we also wrote off other assets that had no future value to the company 
these write offs were slightly offset by income recognized under our equipment build out agreement with c in fiscal and  we sold equipment manufactured by us to c at cost plus an overhead allocation equivalent to that recognized on our government contracts 
the reimbursement by c of actual manufacturing costs was recorded as a reduction in fixed assets  while the overhead allocation portion of the funds offset other expense 
interest income  net interest income  net has increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher average cash balances being available in fiscal as a result of a public stock offering completed in february a portion of the proceeds received from the offering was used to repay all debt that was outstanding  therefore during much of the third quarter and all of the fourth quarter of fiscal  there was no interest expense incurred 
in november  we obtained a term loan from nationsbank to fund the acquisition and construction of our manufacturing facility in durham  north carolina 
most of that interest was capitalized during fiscal income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this increase resulted from increased profitability during fiscal over fiscal our effective tax rate during fiscal was compared to in fiscal fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal a significant portion of the rise was attributable to the increase in led volume sold pursuant to an amendment to the purchase agreement with siemens 
this agreement and two subsequent amendments provided million in additional revenue in fiscal over fiscal this significant increase in volume sold was offset by a decline in our average sales price per led sold 
wafer and other materials revenue increased in fiscal over fiscal due to a increase in wafer volume associated with greater interest in the worldwide research community for sic based products  as well as revenues from c c activity grew as a result of the execution in july of the new supply agreement and development agreement 
revenues for the displays business increased in fiscal over fiscal due to increased interest among customers for indoor video displays 
contract revenue increased to million during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as a result of a change in the mix of funding from available contracts 
contracts funded for fiscal included a higher amount of proceeds recognized under two cost share arrangements 
for these arrangements  funds are recorded as a reduction in research and development expense rather than as contract revenue 
as funds associated with these two programs were exhausted during fiscal  we shifted our resources to programs under a cost plus or catalog price arrangement  in which funding is recorded as contract revenue 
therefore contract revenue was higher in fiscal than included in revenue for fiscal is a one time license fee of million 
this license fee was earned pursuant to a license and technology transfer agreement entered into in september with shin etsu 
pursuant to this agreement  we granted shin etsu a license to use certain epitaxial and device fabrication process technology for the manufacture of our blue led product 
we did not record any license fee revenue during fiscal gross profit our gross profit increased to million in fiscal over fiscal our gross margin was for both fiscal and fiscal license fees  which have no corresponding cost  were included in fiscal results 
without license fee revenue  gross profit would have been million or of revenue for fiscal the overall increase in gross profit in fiscal resulted from higher revenue and lower led and material costs per unit 
the lower led and wafer costs were recognized due to higher throughput  which more effectively utilized capacity and yield efficiencies 
the greater throughput enabled us to spread fixed cost investments over a larger volume of product 
greater yield in led applications resulted from a combination of a new smaller die size and a new larger two inch diameter wafer and in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the introduction of the conductive buffer technology 
yield was also higher for led and materials due to plant processing efficiency and a higher quality of wafer materials used in these products 
the cost of contract revenue has increased in fiscal over fiscal  due to the change in the mix of funding from available contracts 
costs for fiscal included a higher amount of expenses recognized under two cost share arrangements 
for these arrangements  costs are recorded as research and development expenses rather than cost of contract revenue 
when funding under these two contracts was completed in the second quarter of fiscal  all resources were shifted to cost plus and catalog priced contracts  where expenses are recorded as a cost of contract revenue 
research and development research and development costs decreased by to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal due to a reduction in work performed under two cost share contracts to further the blue laser research 
these cost share contracts concluded during the first half of fiscal additionally  research and development costs for fiscal included a one time write off of million for the closure of our eastern european division  located in st 
petersburg  russia 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal due to the receipt of two one time insurance payments 
as a result of the dismissal in november of a securities class action lawsuit filed in october  we were reimbursed million from our insurance carrier for costs incurred in defense of the suit 
in addition  as a result of a negotiated cost cap  we received a million reimbursement of medical expenses that were incurred under a partially self funded insured health plan 
as a percentage of revenue  these costs have decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal other expense in fiscal  other expenses included a net loss recorded on the write down of leasehold improvements  the disposal of certain other fixed assets and a write off of  for the remaining value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the real color displays subsidiary 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with c to sell equipment manufactured by us at cost plus a reasonable overhead allocation 
the overhead allocation was recorded as other income  however  the amount was more than offset by leasehold write offs associated with the move to our new facility and other asset disposals 
other expense for fiscal was higher than that recorded in fiscal as large fixed asset write downs were recorded as the result of a physical plant inventory 
these write downs were greater than those recorded in fiscal interest income  net interest income  net increased by million in fiscal over fiscal due to higher investable cash balances available in fiscal cash balances were higher in fiscal as we generated approximately million from operations compared to approximately million in fiscal income tax expense our effective income tax rate increased to for fiscal from a effective rate during fiscal the lower rate for fiscal resulted from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date through sales of equity  bank borrowings and revenue from product and contract sales 
on february   we completed our public stock offering and raised approximately million  net of offering expenses and the repayment of long term debt 
there were no selling shareholders 
the company expects that the majority of these funds will continue to be used to expand facilities and equipment capacity 
the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital and potential acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses 
the company may also issue additional shares of common stock for the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets 
although the company from time to time evaluates potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses and anticipates continuing to make such evaluations  the company has no present commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition or investment in another business 
as of june   we had working capital of approximately million  including million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
operating activities generated million in cash during fiscal this was attributable primarily to net income of million  other non cash expenses of million  million in deferred income tax benefits and million for tax benefits associated with stock options 
these amounts were partly offset by an increase of million in accounts receivable and a million rise in inventory 
most of the million of cash used in investing activities in fiscal was related to expenditures associated with the construction of our new manufacturing facility in durham  north carolina and increased manufacturing capacity in the crystal growth  epitaxial  clean room and pack and test areas 
the company also invested million to acquire an investment in the common stock of mvis 
the million of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal related primarily to the receipt of million related to proceeds from the public stock offering and the exercise of stock warrants and stock options from the company s employee stock option plan 
this significant inflow of cash was partly offset by the million payoff of long term debt and a million repurchase of common stock 
this stock was repurchased at an average price of per share 
the stock warrants exercised were distributed in connection with our september private placement and have an exercise price of 
as of june  warrants remained outstanding to purchase  shares  these warrants will expire in september we are currently engaged in construction activities related to a new packaging area and the expansion of our crystal growth department 
these additions  which are expected to be completed by calendar year end  will allow us to consolidate all led and wafer manufacturing facilities to one site with improved manufacturing capabilities 
in order to grow existing products and provide expanded facilities for our new microwave product line  we anticipate a second phase of expansion to facilities and infrastructure to begin in fiscal we anticipate total costs for these expenses to be between and million 
estimates for equipment costs related to this expansion also total between and million 
we plan to fund these capital projects with internally generated cash plus cash on hand 
impact of the year state of readiness we have evaluated all of our internal software  embedded systems and products against year concerns and believe that our products and businesses will not be substantially affected by the advent of the year we have completed a year compliance plan that included four phases inventory  assessment  remediation and testing 
a detailed inventory of all computers and related systems was completed and all critical upgrades were finished for all computers that were non year compliant 
all factory dependent computers were also tested and are now year compliant 
the only other remaining steps include a network patch that impacts our utilities and the conversion of the electronic mail system 
we do not believe that these conversions are business critical 
individual software installations are also being reviewed 
these remaining areas should be completed no later than september although we cannot control whether and how third parties will address the year issue  we have now contacted critical vendors and suppliers and have been informed that they have the ability to ensure smooth delivery of products without disruptions caused by year problems 
based on the responses of these vendors to our survey  we believe that our vendors are either substantially year compliant or that any noncompliance will not have a material effect on our operations 
we have now received assurances from of these vendors 
we anticipate that the remaining vendors also will be able to ensure delivery of product  however  we do not expect that this assessment will be complete until september costs we do not believe that the costs associated with year compliance have had a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as of june   this project is substantially complete and we do not anticipate that we will incur any material costs in winding up the project 
year risks although we believe that our planning efforts are adequate to address our year concerns  there can be no assurance that we will not experience negative consequences and material costs as a result of undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal systems 
also  there is no assurance that the systems of third parties on which we rely will be made compliant on a timely basis 
if realized  these risks could result in an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our greatest risk stems from the potential non compliance of our suppliers 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components and equipment necessary for the manufacture of our products 
accordingly  if those suppliers are unable to process or fill our orders or otherwise interact with us because of year problems  we could experience material adverse effects to our business 
we are in the process of assessing the year status of our suppliers and are investigating alternate sources of supply 
as a consequence of our dependence on limited sources of supply  we generally maintain a significant inventory of certain critical materials and require suppliers to keep certain amounts of inventory available for us 
there can be no assurance that we will have enough materials on hand to continue production without interruption in the event one or more of our suppliers experiences year problems that affect its their ability to supply us 
any supply chain disruptions would affect our ability to manufacture our products  which could result in material adverse consequences to our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies we have not yet developed a contingency plan to address what the company should do if we are unable to address the year issue 
we expect the contingency plan to be in place after the inquiry of vendors and customers is completed
