thereafter  over the next few years  the company anticipates that capital expenditures will average in excess of million per year 
the company receives cash from the exercise of employee stock options 
in  stock options and their related tax benefits provided million of cash compared with million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and their related tax benefits have varied and are expected to continue to vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of the company s stock relative to the exercise price of such options 
the company has a stock repurchase program primarily to offset the dilutive effect of its employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
in both and  shares repurchased exceeded the number of shares covered by options granted in each of those years 
in  the company repurchased million shares of its common stock at a total cost of million  and in  the company purchased million shares of common stock at a cost of million 
in october  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional billion of common stock through december  at december   million of this authorization remained 
at stock prices similar to the closing price on december   the company expects to repurchase fewer shares in than in to provide for financial flexibility and increased liquidity  the company has established several sources of debt financing 
as of december   the company had million of unsecured debt securities outstanding 
these unsecured debt securities consisted of million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of and mature in that were issued in december under a million debt shelf registration the shelf  million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of and mature in and million of debt securities that bear interest at fixed rates averaging and have remaining maturities of less than five years  of which million mature within one year 
under the shelf  all of the remaining million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered under the company s medium term note program 
the company s sources of debt financing also include a commercial paper program which provides for short term borrowings up to an aggregate face amount of million

the company invests its excess cash in securities with varying maturities to meet projected cash needs 
the company believes that existing funds  cash generated from operations and existing sources of debt financing are adequate to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future  as well as to support its stock repurchase program 
however  the company may raise additional capital from time to time 
results of operations product sales product sales were  million in  an increase of million or over the prior year 
in  product sales were  million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
quarterly product sales volume is influenced by a number of factors including underlying demand and wholesaler inventory management practices 
epogen r epoetin alfa epogen r sales were  million in  an increase of million or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the administration of higher doses and the continuing growth in the us dialysis patient population 
the administration of higher doses of epogen r was principally due to changes in reimbursement announced in march and june by the health care financing administration hcfa  discussed below  as well as many dialysis providers using better anemia management practices  including using hemoglobin instead of hematocrit to measure red blood cell counts 
in september  hcfa implemented changes the hcfa policy changes to its reimbursement policy 
prior to the hcfa policy changes  fiscal intermediaries under contract with hcfa were authorized to pay reimbursement claims for patients whose hematocrits exceeded percent  the top of the suggested target hematocrit range in the company s labeling  if deemed medically justified 
under the hcfa policy changes  medical justification was not accepted for payment of claims of hematocrits that exceeded percent and  if the current month s hematocrit was greater than percent and the patient s hematocrit exceeded percent on an historical day rolling average basis  reimbursement for the current month would be denied in full 
beginning in the second quarter of  the company experienced a decline in the growth rate of epogen r sales as dialysis providers attempted to lower hematocrits by lowering or withholding epogen r doses in order to avoid or minimize claim denials under the hcfa policy changes 
however  in march  hcfa announced the easing of restrictions on reimbursement that had been instituted under the hcfa policy changes 
in june  hcfa announced further revisions 
in march  hcfa issued two revisions the march hcfa revisions to the hcfa policy changes in a program memorandum 
the first revision provided that  for a month in which the three month rolling average hematocrit exceeds percent  hcfa would pay the lower of percent of the actual dosage billed for that month  or percent of the prior month s allowable epogen r dosage 
the second revision re established authorization to make payment for epogen r when a patient s hematocrit exceeded percent when accompanied by documentation establishing medical necessity 
in june  hcfa issued another program memorandum establishing additional revisions the june hcfa revisions to the reimbursement policy 
the policy now states that pre payment review of claims has been eliminated and fiscal intermediaries should conduct post payment reviews of those dialysis providers with an atypical number of patients with hematocrit levels above a day rolling average of percent 
additionally  hcfa stated that it is encouraging dialysis providers to maintain a hematocrit level within the range of to percent as recommended by the dialysis outcomes quality initiative 
hcfa also stated that it plans to develop a national policy for medical justification for physicians who target their patients hematocrits greater than percent 
in the interim  individual patient treatment will continue to be subject to the physician s discretion and documentation must satisfy the judgment of the fiscal intermediary 
the june hcfa revisions supersede the hcfa policy changes and the march hcfa revisions 
in  epogen r sales were  million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to growth in the us dialysis patient population 
however  as discussed above  epogen r sales in were adversely affected by the hcfa policy changes 
neupogen r filgrastim worldwide neupogen r sales were  million in  an increase of million or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the growth in demand within the us cancer chemotherapy market and the effect of higher prices in the us the company believes that the use of protease inhibitors as a treatment for aids has reduced and may continue to reduce sales of neupogen r for off label use as a supportive therapy in this setting 
neupogen r is not approved or promoted for such use  except in australia and canada 
in  worldwide neupogen r sales were  million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to growth in demand and higher prices 
unfavorable foreign currency effects and european union eu government initiatives to lower health care expenditures reduced growth in eu sales 
cost containment pressures in the us health care marketplace have limited growth in domestic neupogen r sales 
these pressures are expected to continue to influence growth for the foreseeable future 
the growth of the colony stimulating factor csf market in the eu in which neupogen r competes has remained flat  principally due to eu government pressures on physician prescribing practices in response to ongoing government initiatives to reduce health care expenditures 
additionally  the company faces competition from another granulocyte csf product 
amgen s csf market share in the eu has remained relatively constant over the last few years  however  the company expects that the competitive intensity may increase in the near future 
other product sales in  the first full year infergen r interferon alfacon was on the market  infergen r sales were million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
in  infergen r sales were million  much of which was to fill distribution channels 
infergen r was launched in october for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus infection 
there are other treatments  including a new therapy launched in  for this infection against which infergen r competes 
the company cannot predict the extent to which it will penetrate this market 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was  and for  and  respectively

during the third quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million relating to a spillover arbitration award to johnson johnson 
see note to the consolidated financial statements johnson johnson arbitrations

this decrease was primarily due to the write downs of certain non current assets  primarily cost method equity investments  partially offset by a gain realized on the sale of stock in an unaffiliated company 
in  interest and other income increased million or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to higher interest income generated from the company s investment portfolio as a result of higher average cash balances 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the tax rate in all three years reflected the tax benefits from the sale of products manufactured in the company s puerto rico fill and finish facility 
the tax rate increased as a result of higher pretax income in combination with a provision in the federal tax law which took effect in that caps tax benefits associated with the company s puerto rico operations at the income level 
the lower tax rate during compared with and is primarily the result of reduced pretax income due to the legal assessment recorded in the third quarter of see legal award assessment without a corresponding reduction in tax benefits related to puerto rican operations

the company uses foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts which generally expire within months to hedge certain anticipated future sales and expenses 
at december   outstanding foreign currency option and forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
year the year problem the year problem results from computer programs and devices that do not differentiate between the year and the year because they were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  accordingly  computer systems that have time sensitive calculations may not properly recognize the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of the company s operations  including  without limitation  manufacturing  distribution  clinical development  research and other business activities 
the year problem is likely to affect the company s computer hardware  software  systems  devices  applications and manufacturing equipment  including without limitation  its non information technology systems such as elevators  hvac equipment  security systems and other equipment containing embedded technology such as microcontrollers collectively  computer systems 
amgen is not currently year compliant 
like many corporations  the company does not have any previous experience with an issue like the year problem 
the year problem potentially affects the company across its worldwide locations and within substantially all of its business activities 
although the company believes it is developing an appropriate program to address the year problem  it cannot guarantee that its program will succeed or will be timely 
the following is a discussion of the company s year program 
amgen has conducted an initial review of its computer systems to identify those areas that could be affected by the year problem and has established a program to address year issues 
the company is evaluating its functional areas and site locations worldwide 
additionally  the company has appointed a program manager for year compliance 
the company has identified the following three principal areas of potential computer systems exposure at amgen to the year problem  in addition to supplier and customer issues which are discussed elsewhere process control  instruments and environmental monitoring and control systems these types of systems are used in the company s manufacturing and clinical trial processes  among other operations 
these generally are systems  devices and instruments which utilize date functionality and generate  send  receive or manipulate date stamped data and signals 
these systems may be found in data acquisition processing software  laboratory instrumentation and other equipment with embedded code  for example 
these devices and instruments may be controlled by installed software  firmware or other embedded control algorithms 
servers  desktops and infrastructure these generally are desktop computers pcs and macintosh and server computer equipment nt and unix  telecommunications  local area networks  wide area networks  and include system hardware  firmware  installed commercial application software  e mail  video teleconferencing and electronic calendaring systems  for example 
custom applications and business systems these generally are systems which the company either wrote or for which the company has purchased the source code  or applications purchased from an external vendor 
these systems include applications developed or purchased by a functional area on computer systems located within amgen s corporate departments and operated by departmental personnel  such as amgen s core business systems including financial systems and sales operations systems  fund transfer systems and personnel management systems 
amgen has planned an inventory  business risk assessment  remediation  testing and implementation phase in these areas 
the company plans to test appropriate computer systems and implement them in their year compliant form following remediation 
the company has substantially completed the inventory phase and the business risk assessment phase 
the company has revised its deadlines for the remaining phases and expects to have substantially completed the remediation  testing and implementation phases by may   july  and september   respectively 
year compliance testing of the company s computer systems has commenced in some areas 
since the commencement of its year efforts  the company has in the past missed some deadlines at various stages of developing and implementing its program 
however  some schedule slippage has been recovered and the company is working to recover others 
the company is currently behind schedule in some projects 
the company cannot guarantee that it will meet internal or external deadlines for year compliance 
the company is using both internal and external resources to identify  correct reprogram and test its computer systems for year compliance 
however  the company cannot guarantee that these resources will be available at a reasonable cost or at all  due  in part  to competing demands for these resources which the company anticipates will increase as january  nears 
further  while the company plans to complete modifications of its business critical computer systems prior to the year  if modifications of such business critical computer systems  or computer systems of suppliers as defined below are not completed in a timely manner  the year problem could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial position of the company 
the company has begun to identify critical providers of information  goods and services suppliers in order to assess their year compliance readiness 
suppliers will be prioritized based on business criticality and year surveys will be sent to them 
the company plans to have distributed such surveys by march   although some suppliers have been contacted already 
although the company cannot control suppliers response time or rate to the company s surveys  the company hopes to have assessed survey responses by may  and confirmed year readiness of selected suppliers by august  the company does not intend to contact entities that are not critical and cannot guarantee that such entities will be year compliant 
the company plans to visit selected suppliers to confirm their year compliance 
in some cases  the company also plans to stock extra inventory and qualify alternate suppliers  although the company cannot guarantee the availability of additional supplies or the year compliance of alternate suppliers 
the failure of suppliers to become year compliant on a timely basis  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is also working to identify its key customers and to understand year exposure and compliance in that area 
however  the company believes that the failure of its key customers to become year compliant on a timely basis  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may also be affected by the failure of other third parties to be year compliant even though these third parties do not directly conduct business with amgen 
for example  the failure of state  federal and private payors or reimbursers to be year compliant and thus unable to make timely  proper or complete payments to sellers and users of the company s products  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the government accounting office has stated that the health care financing administration  the principal federal reimburser for the company s marketed products  may not become fully year compliant on a timely basis 
the company does not currently have a year contingency plan established 
however  the company is in the process of developing a reasonably likely worst case year scenario and identifying the principal risks to amgen 
once such a scenario has been established the company will develop a contingency plan 
the company has revised its deadlines for finalizing and implementing a contingency plan and anticipates finalizing a contingency plan by mid and implementing such plan by november as of december   total expenditures related to the company s year program  including  without limitation  anticipated upgrades  remediation and new computer systems  are expected to range from million to million  approximately one third of which is expected to be capital expenditures 
however  these amounts are only estimates and are based on information currently available to the company  the company cannot guarantee that these amounts will be adequate to address the company s year compliance needs 
as of december   the company estimates that it had incurred approximately million in its year efforts  including without limitation  internal staff costs  outside consulting fees and computer systems upgrades 
the statements set forth herein concerning the year problem which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
there can be no guarantee that any estimates or other forward looking statements will be achieved and actual results could differ significantly from those planned or contemplated 
the company plans to update the status of its year program as necessary in its periodic filings and in accordance with applicable securities laws 
financial outlook the company believes that dialysis providers have increased doses primarily in response to the june hcfa revisions and due to certain dialysis providers using hemoglobin instead of hematocrit to measure red blood cell counts see results of operations product sales epogen r epoetin alfa 
the company also believes that increases in the us dialysis patient population and dose will continue to grow epogen r sales in the near term 
patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
therefore  epogen r sales may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government 
the clinton administration has proposed a medicare cost savings plan which includes a provision for cutting medicare reimbursement of epogen r by 
this proposal will be addressed during the federal government s fiscal year budget process 
the company believes the proposal  if enacted  would primarily affect dialysis providers that use epogen r and it is difficult to predict its impact on amgen 
future neupogen r sales growth is dependent primarily upon further penetration of existing markets  the timing and nature of additional indications for which the product may be approved and the effects of competitive products 
although not approved or promoted for use in amgen s domestic or foreign markets  except for australia and canada  the company believes that currently approximately of its worldwide neupogen r sales are from off label use as a supportive therapy to various aids treatments 
changes in aids therapies  including protease inhibitors that may be less myelosuppressive  are believed to have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect such sales 
neupogen r usage is expected to continue to be affected by cost containment pressures on health care providers worldwide 
in addition  reported neupogen r sales will continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  government budgets and increased competition in europe 
generally  in the us the cost of drugs and biologicals administered to medicare eligible patients receiving outpatient services  such as chemotherapy infusion  is reimbursed under medicare only if those drugs and biologicals qualify for coverage under medicare part b 
generally  drugs and biologicals that are usually self administered are not covered by medicare 
however  medicare does pay for some drugs and biologicals that are furnished incident to a physician s services 
currently  neupogen r is reimbursed by hcfa under medicare part b 
hcfa has established broad medicare coverage policies and  in some cases  interpretations of its policies 
however  the medicare program is administered by a local carrier typically a private insurance organization that contracts with hcfa in each state  which is overseen by a medical director under contract with hcfa 
these carriers and medical directors have the authority to interpret medicare reimbursement coverage policies 
the company is aware that medical directors in a few states have preliminarily considered that neupogen r should not be eligible for reimbursement under medicare part b principally because  in their opinions  it is usually self administered when delivered subcutaneously 
although to date no local carrier has adopted guidelines or coverage policies that would exclude neupogen r from medicare part b coverage  there can be no assurance that these or other carriers or hcfa will not in the future adopt interpretations or guidelines under medicare part b or otherwise  that could exclude or limit reimbursement for neupogen r 
any guidelines or policies that limit or eliminate reimbursement for neupogen r could adversely affect neupogen r sales 
the clinton administration has proposed a reduction in the basis upon which medicare reimburses for outpatient prescription drugs from the current average wholesale price awp to a proposed level of awp 
this proposal would impact reimbursement of neupogen r 
the company believes that this new recommendation  if enacted  would primarily affect customers that use neupogen r and it is difficult to predict its impact on amgen 
infergen r interferon alfacon was launched in october for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus infection 
there are other treatments  including a new therapy launched in  for this infection against which infergen r competes 
the company cannot predict the extent to which it will penetrate this market 
the company is presently engaged in certain litigation related to infergen r  as described in item legal proceedings infergen r litigation 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed herein are by their nature forward looking 
investors are cautioned that forward looking statements or projections made by the company  including those made in this document  are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales  earnings per share and expenses 
amgen operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
future operating results and the company s stock price may be affected by a number of factors  including  without limitation i the results of preclinical and clinical trials  ii regulatory approvals of product candidates  new indications and manufacturing facilities  iii reimbursement for amgen s products by governments and private payors  iv health care guidelines and policies relating to amgen s products  v intellectual property matters patents and the results of litigation  vi competition  vii fluctuations in operating results and viii rapid growth of the company 
these factors and others are discussed herein and in the sections appearing in item business factors that may affect amgen  which sections are incorporated herein by reference 
legal matters the company is engaged in arbitration proceedings with one of its licensees 
for a discussion of these matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income earned on the company s investment portfolio is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the company s short term borrowings effectively bear interest at variable rates and therefore  changes in us interest rates affect interest expense incurred thereon 
the company has reduced this exposure to interest rate changes by entering into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively changes interest expense incurred on a portion of its short term borrowings to a fixed rate 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s long term borrowings because they all bear interest at fixed rates 
the following tables provide information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the company s investment portfolio and debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  the company has assumed its available for sale debt securities  comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities  are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
for the interest rate swap  the table presents the notional amount and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity date 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract

receive rate the company is exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in its portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices would result in an approximate million and million decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale equity securities at december  and  respectively
