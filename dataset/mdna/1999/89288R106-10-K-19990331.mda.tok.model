the company typically earns fees from its development and construction services business which are based upon a negotiated percentage of a project s cost  and the company may receive incentive bonuses for completing a development project under budget and within certain critical time deadlines 
the fees generated in the company s brokerage and retail services businesses are typically paid in connection with the consummation of a transaction such as the purchase or sale of commercial property or the execution of a lease 
revenues from the company s investment activities primarily consist of gain on disposition of real estate and income from unconsolidated subsidiaries that hold real estate assets 
the company has limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss 
because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact the company s financial performance in any period  these investment activities could create fluctuations in the company s revenues 
because the company s investment strategy typically entails making relatively modest investments alongside its corporate and institutional clients  its ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets 
in recent months  providers of capital for real estate investment have taken a more cautious approach regarding investment in development projects 
if this trend continues or accelerates  the company s investment activities  as well as its traditional construction and development business  could be adversely affected

in addition  an increasing percentage of the company s property management and infrastructure management contracts provide for bonus payments if the company achieves certain performance targets 
such incentive payments are generally earned in the fourth quarter 
in contrast  the company s non variable operating expenses  which are treated as expenses when incurred during the year  are relatively constant on a quarterly basis

while the company has primarily used borrowings under its million revolving line of credit and internally generated funds to achieve growth  it intends to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy by expanding client relationships  expanding the breadth of its service offerings  making selective co investments with its clients and pursuing selective strategic acquisitions 
the company believes that its ability to pursue acquisitions will be greatly enhanced by its ability to use external sources of capital  including the public capital markets and the commercial banking industry  to finance such acquisitions

impact of year the year problem refers to the inability of many existing computer programs to properly recognize or process a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many time sensitive computer programs using two digits to indicate the year may recognize as the year rather than the year the failure to recognize the year and other key dates could result in a variety of problems from data miscalculations to the failure of entire systems 
in early  the company formed a year task force the task force including internal technical  operational  financial and legal representatives and technical and legal consultants 
under the direction of the task force  the company is pursuing multiple year related initiatives collectively  the program with the goal of mitigating the impact of year issues on company operations 
information technology systems prior to the formation of the task force  the system services provider that operates and maintains the company s central data center had conducted an assessment of the data center s information technology it systems for the purpose of assessing such systems year readiness 
the it systems resident at the company s central data center include its central property management system hardware and software handling accounting and reporting for approximately of the company managed properties  its central communication system e mail  wide area network and internet servers and its central work order system 
on the basis of this assessment and the installation of previously planned hardware and software upgrades  completed early in  the company believes that the data center it systems should not be materially adversely affected by year issues 
one of the program initiatives calls for the inventory  assessment and remediation of it assets mainly consisting of pcs  servers and resident software at company locations remote from the data center 
company technical personnel are currently engaged in the first phase of this initiative  in which it assets in the company s largest offices will be inventoried  assessed and remediated 
inventory and assessment of pc hardware and inventory of software for this first phase was completed in february assessment of the software inventory for this phase was completed in march  and the company has commenced indicated remediation 
following completion of the first phase inventory  the company commenced the second phase  inventorying and assessing it assets in those smaller offices where the company believes that the criticality of the it assets warrants the assessment effort 
the inventory and assessment of pc hardware and inventory of software for this second phase and inventory and assessment of all field office servers is expected to be complete in april assessment of the software inventory for this second phase is also expected to be complete in april  whereupon the company will commence the indicated remediation 
costs associated with both phases of the field office inventory and assessment effort  expected to be incurred no later than the first quarter of  are expected to total less than  as of december    of such costs have been incurred and expensed 
these costs include license fees for application software used in the inventory and assessment process and fees paid to consultants in connection with the assessment of the software inventory 
based on earlier inventory and assessment of it assets conducted by an independent consultant at two of the company s larger field offices  the company currently estimates that the cost of year it asset remediation at all of its field offices will be approximately million in excess of normal  recurring pc acquisitions and replacements 
this amount represents anticipated expenditures for year driven pc replacement and commercial application software upgrades  and these costs will be capitalized and amortized over their respective useful lives 
as this amount is based on a sample  actual remediation costs may differ materially 
none of these costs have been incurred as of december  managed properties non it systems another of the program initiatives calls for the company to assist owners of company managed properties with the inventory  assessment and remediation of non it systems at such properties 
most of the company s field offices are in leased premises in these managed properties 
in  owners and tenants of many of the properties managed by the company began to contact the company seeking information as to the year readiness of the properties they own or occupy 
in response to these requests  the company began making inquiries of vendors of building systems as to the year readiness of such systems  communicating with owners and tenants as to the results of these inquiries and assisting owners with the remediation recommended by the vendors or otherwise requested by the owners 
in the summer of  the company determined to engage a consultant to serve as a project manager and technical resource for the company s property management personnel as work on this initiative continues at company managed properties 
under the direction of the project manager  the company expects to complete its inventory and assessment work on this initiative in april following the inventory and assessment work  the company will assist owners with the remediation of indicated year issues in accordance with owners instructions 
this information is intended solely to advise the investment community of the steps that the company is taking to assist owners of company managed properties in which most of the company s offices are located with year issues relating to non it systems 
no owner or tenant in a company managed property should rely on this statement as an indication that the company has or will inventory or assess the managed property on its behalf or that  in fact  such property is or will be in a state of year readiness 
queries in this regard should be addressed to appropriate property management personnel 
the company currently expects that its unreimbursed out of pocket costs relating to this initiative  including the costs of the consultant engaged to act as the project manager and technical resource  should not exceed million 
costs of remediating year issues associated with non it systems at managed properties should be borne exclusively by the owners or tenants of such properties 
year readiness of third parties the company is to varying degrees dependent on the year readiness of third parties 
because of the breadth of the company s customer base  the success of its business is not closely tied to the success of any particular customer 
aside from vendors of certain it systems that have already been contacted by the company concerning the year compliance of their products  the company is in the preliminary stages of identifying the other parties with which it does business utilities  other vendors  etc 
whose year problems could adversely impact the company 
another program initiative calls for the company to make appropriate inquiries of these parties 
the company expects to complete these inquiries in the second quarter of year risks significant uncertainty exists concerning the scope and magnitude of problems associated with year issues 
while the goal of the program is to mitigate the impact of year issues on the company s operations  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so 
for example  there is no assurance that the program itself will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or that unforeseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the program that would materially and adversely affect the company 
year related failures of mission critical systems or at company managed properties could materially adversely affect the company s operations 
contingency plans the company currently does not have any contingency plans in place 
as the program initiatives described above are pursued further  the company will continue to consider the need for contingency plans 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on its results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
