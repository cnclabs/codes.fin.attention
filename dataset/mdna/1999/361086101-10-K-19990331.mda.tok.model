year issue although kaneb believes that most of its activities and operations are not materially impacted by year issues yk  the company recognizes the challenges associated with yk and has undertaken a review and testing of its computer systems to identify yk related issues associated with any items of software or hardware used in its business operations 
most of the software systems used by kaneb are licensed from third parties and are yk compliant or will be upgraded to yk compliant releases before the end of this issue is being addressed by kaneb in multiple phases  including assessment  remediation  testing and implementation  and progress is being monitored by the company s senior management 
all material systems  on a world wide basis  including non information technology systems which may house non compliant  embedded technology are being evaluated 
in addition to addressing kaneb s own systems  as described above  the company must assess the state of readiness of the systems of other entities with which it does business 
failure by these third parties to adequately resolve their yk problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
kaneb believes its success in being yk compliant will not be conclusively known until the year is actually reached 
although failure by one or more of the company s own systems could result in lost revenues and or additional expenses required to carry out manual processing of transactions  the company cannot predict the effect that external forces could have on its business 
failures by banking institutions  the telecommunications industry and others could have far reaching effects on the entire economy and the company 
the company s operations including both information technology and non information technology systems are in varying states of readiness for compliance with yk issues 
the initial assessment phase has been completed for substantially all of the company s operations  and in many cases  remediation  testing and implementation activities have also been completed 
the company expects to complete all phases of its yk program prior to december  kaneb believes that it is not possible to determine with certainty that all yk problems affecting the company have been identified or corrected 
the number of devices that could be affected and the interactions among these devices are simply too numerous 
in addition  the company cannot accurately predict how many failures related to the yk problem will occur or the severity  duration or financial consequences of such failures 
the company has hired an outside yk consultant to assist the company in meeting its goals and in developing contingency plans to define and address the worst case scenario likely to be faced by the company 
the plan is expected to be in place by the end of the second quarter of expenses incurred by kaneb during and  related to assessing  remediating and testing its information technology systems  which were not material  have been expensed as incurred and funded from operations 
the company does not anticipate that the cost to become fully yk compliant will be material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on the company s debt and investment portfolios 
the company centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents  accordingly  the carrying amounts approximate fair value 
the company s investments are not material to the financial position or performance of the company 
assuming year end variable rate debt and investment levels  a one percent change in interest rates would increase net interest expense and decrease interest of outside non controlling partners in kpp s net income by approximately million and million  respectively
