item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere herein 
general the company  through its subsidiaries  holds the only licenses to own and operate a racetrack and racing centers in virginia 
the company currently operates racing centers in chesapeake  richmond  hampton  and alberta  virginia  and may open two additional racing centers if suitable opportunities are identified 
the company s revenues are comprised of i pari mutuel commissions from wagering on races broadcast from out of state racetracks to the company s racing centers and the track using import simulcasting  ii wagering at the track and the company s racing centers on its live races  iii admission fees  program  racing form and tip sheet sales  and certain other ancillary activities  iv commissions from food and beverage sales and concessions  and v fees from wagering at out of state locations on races run at the track using export simulcasting 
the amount of revenue the company earns from each wager depends on where the race is run and where the wagering takes place 
revenues from import simulcasting of out of state races and from wagering at the track and at the racing centers on races run at the track consist of the total amount wagered at the company s facilities  less the amount paid as winning wagers

revenues from the racing centers help support live racing at the track 
however  expenses from live racing and track operations exceeded earnings from the racing centers for in  several key contracts were renegotiated which the company expects will improve its profitability going forward

on january   the company negotiated an agreement with pnc bank  na pnc  which restructured the principal payment of the credit agreement dated june  under the agreement  in lieu of making principal payments on the due dates  the guarantors are required to deliver to pnc  letters of credit in the face amount of future principal payments 
the letters of credit shall have an expiration of july  a guarantor posted a million letter of credit in lieu of the company making the principal due december  the company anticipates that the guarantors will post letters of credit for the principal payments due during on march   the company obtained an amendment to the note payable with a shareholder  which deferred the due date of the note from august  to august  the company s capital expenditures budget for fiscal year is  the company expects  as a result of recent renogotiation of several vendor contracts  that cash flows from operations and the availability of other capital and financial resources will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its normal operating requirements  capital expenditure plans  and existing debt service over the fiscal year 
effect of inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operations has not been significant in recent years 
there can be no assurance  however  that a high rate of inflation in the future will not have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
seasonality and the effect of inclement weather revenues and expenses relating to the track may be higher during scheduled live racing than at other times of the year 
in addition  weather conditions sometimes cause cancellation of outdoor horse races or curtail attendance  both of which reduce wagering 
attendance and wagering at both outdoor races and indoor racing centers also may be adversely affected by certain holidays and professional and college sports seasons as well as other recreational activities 
conversely  attendance and wagering may be favorably affected by special racing events which stimulate interest in horse racing  such as the triple crown races in may and june and the breeders cup in november 
as a result  the company s revenues and net income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
given that a substantial portion of the company s track expenses are fixed  the loss of scheduled racing days could have a material adverse affect on the company s profitability 
the company believes that simulcasting diminishes the effect of inclement weather on wagering 
impact of year the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year is known as the year issue 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment and will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company is currently in the process of replacing certain hardware and software in order to be year compliant 
the project is scheduled to be completed during the first half of without material costs 
the company relies significantly on the tote system used in pari mutuel wagering  which is provided and supported by an outside vendor 
if the software changes and modifications both internal and external of existing software are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income and sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
sfas became effective in the first quarter of the company had no components of comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes new standards on reporting information about operating segments in both annual and interim financial statements 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the adoption of the new requirements of sfas no 
did not impact the company s disclosure of segment information because the company operates in one line of business 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments sfas 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair market value 
presently  the company does not use derivative instruments either in hedging activities or as investments 
accordingly  the company believes that adoption of sfas will have no impact on its financial position or results of operations
