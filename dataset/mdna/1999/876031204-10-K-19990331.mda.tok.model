item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations of napro 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
general napro is a natural product pharmaceutical company which is focusing primarily on the development  manufacture and commercialization of paclitaxel  a naturally occurring anti cancer agent found in certain species of yew taxus trees 
napro s paclitaxel is referred to herein as nbt paclitaxel 
napro has devoted its efforts primarily to the development and implementation of its propriety extraction  isolation and purification eip tm technology for producing nbt paclitaxel 
to advance the development and commercialization of nbt paclitaxel  napro entered into year  exclusive agreements with each of faulding and ivax for the clinical development  sales  marketing and distribution of nbt paclitaxel 
napro is actively seeking one or more partners to replace ivax 
napro is currently dependent for revenue exclusively on sales of nbt paclitaxel  on fees from licencing its technology and on amounts payable by ivax to napro under the termination agreement 
through december   napro s production of nbt paclitaxel was limited primarily to research and pilot scale production  and much of napro s product sales were for use in clinical trials and for research and development purposes 
accordingly  napro has generated only limited revenue from such activities and has incurred significant operating losses  including operating losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  napro expects that it will continue to have a high level of operating expense and will be required to make significant up front expenditures in connection with its biomass procurement  product development and research and development activities 
napro anticipates that operating losses will continue until such time  if ever  as napro is able to generate sufficient revenue to support its operations 
napro believes that its ability to generate such revenue depends primarily on the ability to enter into agreements with one or more partners for the clinical development  sales  marketing and distribution of nbt paclitaxel  to obtain regulatory approval in the us or another major market for the commercial sale of nbt paclitaxel  to obtain regulatory approval for its manufacturing facilities and to construct manufacturing facilities that produce quantities of nbt paclitaxel sufficient to supply napro s current and any future strategic partners requirements for commercial sales 
in january  faulding received approval to market nbt paclitaxel commercially in australia under the trade name anzatax tm 
the ability of faulding to continue to market nbt paclitaxel in australia pursuant to faulding s marketing approval and the success of these marketing efforts will continue to have a significant affect on napro s revenue and profitability 
in february  bristol myers squibb company bms submitted a supplemental new drug application with orphan drug designation for paclitaxel for the treatment of kaposi s sarcoma ks ahead of the filing by ivax of a new drug application nda for the same indication 
the bms application was approved by the food and drug administration fda in august under the orphan drug act of  this approval resulted in ivax napro being denied marketing approval for the ks indication for seven years 
in february  due to the delay in receiving marketing approval for paclitaxel  napro underwent a restructuring to decrease overall cost  announcing the planned layoff of employees resulting in a one time charge of approximately  as part of this restructuring  napro discontinued operations at its british columbia manufacturing facility and suspended construction of its commercial scale manufactur ing facility in boulder  colorado 
completion of the boulder facility will require additional financing  which napro intends to seek at such time as napro anticipates sufficient product demand to warrant completion of the facility 
napro incurred  of losses on asset retirements and  of other expense as a result of the suspended construction 
in march  napro and ivax entered into the termination agreement 
termination of the ivax agreement leaves napro free to seek regulatory approvals and market nbt paclitaxel itself or to seek a new partner or partners with which to pursue regulatory approvals and marketing of nbt paclitaxel  in either such case in areas outside the faulding territory 
however  the termination of the ivax agreement currently leaves napro without such a partner  and there can be no assurance that napro will be able to secure such approvals or form new long term relationships for the approval  marketing  and distribution of nbt paclitaxel in these areas  or that napro or such a partner  if found  will be able to secure regulatory approval or effectively market nbt paclitaxel 
napro s future growth and profitability will depend on the success of napro s strategic partners in fostering acceptance in the oncology market for nbt paclitaxel as a preferred form of chemotherapy to be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents 
failure to find such a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on napro 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales were million  up million from sales to ivax for were million  up  from sales to ivax  as a result of the termination agreement  are expected to end in the second quarter 
future product sales in territory outside that covered by napro s agreement with faulding the faulding agreement may be dependent upon the ability of napro to secure new agreements supporting the development and marketing of nbt paclitaxel within that territory 
sales other than to ivax for were million  up  from the increase was due primarily to the timing of product shipments and to inventory fluctuations of napro s strategic partners 
sales may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the timing and size of any clinical trials  napro s obtaining one or more partners to replace ivax  changes in demand  the level of inventory carried and changes in approved markets 
this variability will continue until stable commercial demand has been established for the product in one of napro s principal markets 
research  development and cost of products sold 
research and development expense and cost of products sold for was million  down by million from the decrease resulted primarily from the benefits of the february restructuring  a decrease in the level of process development and research  and lower production cost 
napro s production process is not distinct from its research and development processes 
accordingly  the cost of products sold is included within napro s research and development expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  up  from the increase is attributable primarily to increases of  in legal expense related to european litigation and  of consulting expense primarily related to the ivax termination agreement  partially offset by a reduction in recruiting and relocation expense 
interest income 
interest income for was  up  from the increase is attributable to overall higher interest rates realized on interest bearing investments 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for was  down million from the decrease is primarily attributable to the non recurrence of the million expense related to the amortization of original issue discount on the senior convertible debt  to decreased interest on the senior convertible debt and to decreased borrowing on equipment financing 
see liquidity and capital resources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales for were million  up  from sales to ivax for were million  up million from sales other than to ivax for were million  down million from the increase in total sales was due primarily to the timing of product shipments and to inventory fluctuations of napro s strategic partners 
research  development and cost of products sold 
research and development expense and cost of products sold for was million  up million from the increase resulted primarily from expansion of napro s development and research operations in anticipation of possible approval of the nda filed by ivax with the fda 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  an increase of million from the increase is attributable primarily to increases of million in administrative and support staff   in legal cost   of occupancy cost  and  in consulting and outside service expense 
interest income 
interest income for was  a decrease of  from the decrease is attributable to smaller free cash balances available for investment 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for was million  up million from approximately million of the expense related to the amortization of original issue discount  a non recurring charge  on the senior convertible debt 
the remainder of the increase is attributable to interest on the senior convertible debt and increased borrowing on equipment financing 
see liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources napro s capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   napro had a working capital balance of million 
this compared to a negative working capital balance of million as of december   and reflects the classification as a current liability of million of napro s senior convertible notes  which are due in but which were redeemable by the holders during the early part of under certain conditions 
to date  the funding of napro s capital requirements has been dependent primarily on the net proceeds of public offerings of its common stock of approximately million  on private placements of its equity securities of approxi mately million  on the exercise of warrants and options of million  on net borrowings of million  and on loans and advances from its stockholders and strategic partners 
napro s existing capital and projected sales are expected to provide adequate capital to fund its necessary operations and capital expenditures 
pharmaceutical development is  however  a costly and time consuming process 
napro is actively pursuing partners to assist in the development and marketing of its products  and may seek other forms of long term financing should such financing become available on acceptable terms 
in june napro privately placed million of senior convertible notes 
the notes mature in june and bear an interest rate of 
interest on the notes is payable in cash or in common stock at napro s option 
the notes are convertible into common stock at a discount from the lowest market price of the common stock during specified periods prior to the conversion 
if not converted  upon maturity  the notes will be exchanged for year debentures 
in napro issued  shares of common stock in conversion of  principal of the notes  and  shares of common stock in payment of  interest on the notes 
in january and march  and january and march  the notes were amended see below 
in napro redeemed  in note principal and paid  premium and interest in connection with the redemption 
in january napro redeemed  in note principal and paid  premium and interest in connection with the redemption 
napro anticipates that it may elect to pay off all or part of the notes during in december  napro closed a private placement of  shares of series c senior convertible preferred stock the c preferred for an aggregate issuance price of million 
the c preferred accrues dividends at per year payable in common stock or cash at napro s option 
the c preferred is convertible into common stock at a discount from the market price during specified periods prior to the conversion date 
in december  napro may force the conversion of any remaining shares at the conversion price in effect as of december  in january and march  and january and march   napro entered into amendments the amendments with the c preferred investor and the holders of the senior convertible notes together the investors 
the parties agreed to a limit the number of shares which could be converted in the event the stock price is below per share to no more than  shares per month through may  and b partially remove the ability of the investors to force napro to redeem any portion of the securities for cash 
in the event there is an unconverted amount of securities on may   such amount will be convertible under the original terms of the agreements 
at any time  napro  at its option  may redeem all or part of the securities  with days written notice  for amounts ranging from to of the outstanding principal and accrued dividends and interest 
in napro issued  shares of common stock in conversion of the c preferred and  shares of common stock in payment of dividends on the c preferred 
in june  napro entered into an initial year exclusive agreement with ivax to develop and market paclitaxel in the united states  europe  and other parts of the world the ivax agreement 
napro and ivax terminated the ivax agreement on march  under terms of the termination agreement  ivax received a royalty free  limited  non exclusive license to one of napro s patents the patent in the united states  europe and certain other world markets 
in return  napro received a cash payment of million  million of which was placed in escrow to be released as remaining product is delivered 
in april   ivax returned approximately million shares of napro common stock 
in addition  upon the issuance of the patent in various countries  ivax made additional payments of million 
napro will continue to manufacture a fixed amount of paclitaxel for delivery to ivax periodically during the first half of in napro received  of the million escrow 
napro expects to receive the remaining  in the first half of working capital and cash flow cash and cash equivalents decreased  to million for the year ended december  from million at december  net cash provided by operations of million was offset by investing activity of million and by financing activity of million 
inventory remained at million at december  from december  the amount of work in progress inventory and finished goods inventory is dependent on a number of factors  including the shipping requirements of napro s strategic partners and napro s production planning for meeting those needs 
inventory balances may vary significantly during product development and launch periods 
capital expenditures napro expended  during for capital projects 
these expenditures primarily included plantation cost  work on manufacturing facilities in boulder  and improvements to napro s laboratories 
since the fda s determination that nbt paclitaxel could not be marketed in the us for kaposi s sarcoma during bms s period of exclusivity under the orphan drug act  napro has significantly reduced the scope of its operations and has reduced or delayed capital expenditures 
napro is seeking a new strategic partner or partners to replace ivax 
the nature of napro s relationship with its strategic partners may significantly change its planned capital expenditures 
the amount and timing of future capital expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the establishment of additional strategic relationships  the progress of napro s research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and marketing developments  changes in or terminations of existing strategic relationships and the cost of manufacturing scale up 
napro may seek additional long term financing to fund capital expenditures should such financing become available on terms acceptable to napro 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   napro had net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards is limited after an ownership change  as defined in such section  to an annual amount equal to the value of the loss corporation s outstanding stock immediately before the date of the ownership change multiplied by the federal long term tax exempt rate in effect during the month the ownership change occurred 
such an ownership change occurred in september as a result  napro will be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its net operating losses incurred prior to that date 
this limitation only affects net operating losses incurred up to the ownership change and does not reduce the total amount of net operating loss which may be taken  but rather limits the amount which may be used during a particular year 
therefore  in the event napro achieves profitability  such limitation would have the effect of increasing napro s tax liability and reducing the net income and available cash resources of napro if the taxable income during a year exceeded the allowable loss carried forward to that year 
year issue until recently many computer programs used only the last two digits to refer to a year 
such programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
this matter is commonly referred to as the year issue or yk 
two years ago napro implemented an assessment of its systems and other assets which could be subject to yk 
napro has completed the assessment of its primary systems and has brought all but one of the systems into yk compliance 
a compliant upgrade currently exists for the noncompliant system  which will be brought into compliance no later than june napro is assessing its secondary systems and other assets  including microprocessor controlled equipment  and expects to complete that assessment no later than august the potential for significant interruption from secondary systems exists  although napro believes that the likelihood of interruption caused by yk failures in secondary systems is small 
in addition to its internal systems napro is evaluating potential impact on napro of yk issues with its vendors and customers 
napro cannot directly control yk compliance by its vendors and customers 
napro is communicating with its key vendors and customers regarding this matter 
napro knows of no vendor or customer that has yk issues that have a potential of interrupting napro in a manner that could significantly affect napro s operations 
however  napro uses a number of vendors that napro believes to be the best or the only qualified source of a particular good or service 
sales to napro s customers potentially could be interrupted by customers yk issues 
should a significant customer incur yk problems with its testing  release or other systems  napro s sales could be materially affected 
napro will continue to monitor the level of yk compliance with respect to its key vendors and customers and will further develop contingency plans to cover the failure of a key vendor  including identification and qualification of alternative suppliers 
management believes that exposure to vendor or customer yk issues creates no material risk to napro 
however  no assurance can be given with certainty that yk issues with vendors or customers will not significantly affect napro 
napro s yk effort has caused no significant deferral of other information technology projects 
napro s yk contingency plan includes completion of the evaluation and remediation process discussed above  including communication with its key vendors and customers regarding potential for yk issues  identification of the best alternative vendor for sensitive goods and services  coordination and planning with such alternative vendors 
management believes that yk issues related to both internal and external systems will have no material effect on napro s business  results of operations or financial condition  and that napro s yk risk is not material 
however  no such assurance can be given with certainty 
the cost of addressing yk has not been material  management believes that the cost of completing yk compliance will not be material 
special note regarding forward looking statements certain statements in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including the reform act 
in addition  napro or persons acting on its behalf sometimes make forward looking statements in other written and oral communications 
such forward looking statements may include  among other things  statements concerning napro s plans  objectives and future economic prospects  such as matters relative to seeking and obtaining strategic partners  the availability of patent and other protection for its intellectual property  the completion of clinical trials and regulatory filings  the prospects for and timing of regulatory approvals  the need for and availability of additional capital  the amount and timing of capital expenditures  timing of product introductions and revenue  the availability of raw materials  prospects for future operations  and other statements of expectations  beliefs  future plans and strategies  anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of napro  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the following adverse economic and general business conditions  competition from bms and other existing and new producers of paclitaxel and other drugs  technological advances in cancer treatment and drug development  the ability to obtain rights to technology  the ability to obtain and enforce patents  the ability to obtain raw materials and commercialize manufacturing processes  the effectiveness of nbt paclitaxel and other pharmaceuticals developed by napro in treating disease  the results of clinical studies  the results of research and development activities  the business abilities and judgment of napro s management and other personnel  the availability of qualified personnel generally  changes in and compliance with governmental regulations  the effect of capital market conditions and other factors on capital availability for napro and other biopharmaceutical companies  the ability of faulding to perform its obligations under its existing agreement with napro  the effect on napro s revenue  cash flow and earnings from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  the ability of napro to establish relationships with capable strategic partners to develop and market nbt paclitaxel in the territories not covered by the faulding agreement  and other factors referenced in this report 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during all of napro s revenue resulted from sales of nbt paclitaxel to faulding and ivax 
napro anticipates that the final shipment of nbt paclitaxel required by the termination agreement will be made to ivax during the first half of following this final delivery to ivax  and in the absence of sales to another strategic partner  sales of nbt paclitaxel to faulding will constitute all or substantially all of napro s revenue for the foreseeable future 
faulding purchases nbt paclitaxel from napro at a price which varies in proportion to the price at which faulding sells nbt paclitaxel 
under the faulding agreement  napro is paid a fixed sum for nbt paclitaxel supplied for noncommercial uses  and a fixed percentage of faulding s sales price for nbt paclitaxel supplied for commercial use 
in march of each year  faulding estimates the sales price it will receive for nbt paclitaxel in the upcoming year  and  based upon that estimate  napro determines the price it will charge faulding for nbt paclitaxel the unadjusted price 
napro recognizes the corresponding revenue at the time of shipment of nbt paclitaxel to faulding  based upon the intended use indicated by faulding on its purchase orders 
however  faulding may or may not use the product in accordance with the original use stated on its purchase orders 
additionally  faulding s actual selling price may differ from the amounts originally budgeted and indicated to napro on its purchase orders 
on or about may   faulding will communicate to napro the final amount and type of sales made during the period beginning on april  and ending on march   and an adjustment will be calculated  which may either increase or decrease napro s revenue from sales of products to faulding during this period 
faulding s sales are made in the currencies of each of the countries in which it sells nbt paclitaxel 
as a result  napro s revenue from sales is affected by fluctuations in the value of these various foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar 
faulding s largest single market is australia  accounting for approximately of faulding s commercial sales during the period beginning march  and ending march  during the same period  fluctuations in various currencies  especially the australian dollar  were a major factor in reducing the unadjusted price by 
if changes in foreign currency markets continue to cause a decrease in the price per gram napro receives from faulding  there could be a material adverse effect on napro s earnings and cash flow 
for example  during the period beginning march  and ending march   napro s revenue attributable to sales of nbt paclitaxel to be resold commercially by faulding totaled  had there been additional negative pressure on the relevant exchange rates such that the unadjusted price had been reduced by instead of napro s earnings would have been reduced by approximately  and napro would have experienced materially reduced cash flow 
however  while faulding will continue to have a significant impact on napro s revenue  napro s continuation of operations is dependent upon sources other than revenue from faulding 
napro anticipates that its operations will be dependent upon equity funding and borrowing until such time  if ever  as napro secures one or more partnerships for the territories outside the faulding agreement and secures regulator approval and begins sales in a major market 
there can be no assurance  however  that napro will be able to raise such equity financing and or find a strategic partner or that such a partner  if found  will be able to secure regulatory approval or effectively market napro s products 
certain statements set forth in item a constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act
