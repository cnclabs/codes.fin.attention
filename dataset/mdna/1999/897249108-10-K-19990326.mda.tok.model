item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hcri provides insurance subrogation and related recovery services to the private healthcare payor industry 
hcri services comprise the complete outsourcing of the identification  investigation and recovery of accident related medical benefits incurred by its clients on behalf of their insureds  but for which other persons or entities have primary responsibility 
the rights of hcri s clients to recover the value of these medical benefits arise by law or contract  are known generally as the right of subrogation and are generally paid from the proceeds of liability or workers compensation insurance 
for a typical new client  it takes three to six months from the contract signing when the lives are sold to complete the construction of electronic data interfaces necessary for the company to begin service 
at this point  the new client is considered installed 
during the installation period  the company must also hire and train quality staff necessary to provide contractual services 
after installation  hcri receives data from the client from which it creates an inventory of backlog 
backlog is the total dollar amount of potentially recoverable claims that the company is pursuing on behalf of its clients at a given point in time 
these claims are gross figures  prior to estimates of claim settlement and rejection 
backlog increases when the company opens new files of potentially recoverable claims and decreases when files of claims are recovered or  after further investigation  determined to be nonrecoverable 
historically  subrogation recoveries the amount actually recovered for its clients prior to the company s fee have been produced from the backlog in a generally predictable cycle 
this is because any group of potential recoveries that has been sufficiently large in number to display statistically significant characteristics and that originates from a defined time period  tended to produce recovery results that have been comparable to other groups having similar characteristics 
although some recoveries will be made during the first year of service  the average time to make a recovery is to months  with substantially all recoveries made by the sixth year 
backlog for a client will range from newly identified potential recoveries which will be identified each year to potential recoveries that are in the late stages of the recovery process 
as a result of this cycle  approximately six years from the date of installation  the client s annual amounts of subrogation recoveries as a percent of the client s backlog will be generally constant  except for variations due to the number of installed lives for the client 
for the most part  the company is paid a contingency fee from the amount of subrogation recoveries it makes from backlog on behalf of its clients 
the company s revenues are a function of subrogation recoveries and effective fee rates 
effective fee rates vary depending on the mix between recovery services provided and client fee schedules 
the fee schedules for each client are separately negotiated and reflect the company s standard fee rates  the services to be provided and anticipated volume of services 
the company grants volume discounts and negotiates a lower fee when it assumes backlog from a client because the client will have already completed some of the recovery work 
since the company records expenses as costs are incurred and records revenues only when a file is settled  there is a significant lag between recording of expenses and revenue recognition 
the company s expenses are determined primarily by the number of employees directly engaged in recovery activities cost of services and by the number of employees engaged in a variety of support activities support expenses 
recovery related employees must be hired and trained in advance of the realization of recoveries and revenues and  during times of rapid growth  installed lives and cost of service will grow more rapidly than revenue 
the number of employees accounted for in support expenses generally grows less rapidly than revenue due to economies of scale 
results of operations the following tables present certain key operating indicators and results of operations data for the company for the periods indicated key operating indicators december  cumulative lives sold  beginning of period lives from existing client growth lives added from contracts with existing clients lives added from contracts with new clients cumulative lives sold  end of period lives installed backlog subrogation recoveries throughput effective fee rate subrogation revenues employees direct operations support total employees backlog represents the total dollar amount of potentially recoverable claims that the company is pursuing on behalf of clients at any point in time 
excludes approximately million of recoveries and million of revenues in connection with the breast implant litigation settlement  during throughput equals recoveries for the period divided by the average of backlog at the beginning and end of the period 
statements of income as a percentage of subrogation revenues year ended december  subrogation revenues cost of services support expenses operating income income before income taxes net income compared to revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased  to million from million in growth in subrogation revenues occurred primarily because of increased subrogation recoveries  from million in to million in the effective fee rate increased slightly to from 
the increase in total subrogation recoveries was due primarily to growth in backlog  which in turn grew primarily because of an increase in the number of lives installed 
backlog increased to million at december  from million at december  the company was also able to obtain subrogation recoveries at a rate of approximately of average backlog per quarter during and lives installed grew in to million 
cost of services 
cost of services increased in to million from million in  which is an increase of 
as a percentage of subrogation revenues  cost of services decreased to in from in the decrease is a result of lower growth of lives installed and their associated costs in relative to the growth in revenue for the year and increased efficiencies by the company 
as a result of the nature of the company s contingent fee arrangements with its clients  the company incurs significant current expense in an effort to generate revenue  a significant portion of which will be recorded in future periods 
because relatively little revenue is earned during the first year following the installation of new lives  unless the company assumes responsibility for the new client s existing backlog  the growth rate for lives installed exceeds the revenue growth rate 
support expenses 
support expenses increased to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in due to hiring of additional support staff for the subrosystem upgrade project 
support expenses decreased as a percentage of subrogation revenues from for the twelve months ended december  to for the comparable period in the decline in support expenses as a percentage of subrogation revenues resulted from improved economies of scale in the support functions and also the capitalization of  of certain software development costs associated with the upgrade of the subrosystem for these costs were capitalized in conjunction with the requirements under statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  adopted january   which were historically expensed

net income and earnings per share for the year ended december   excluding  of certain software development costs associated with the upgrade of the subrosystem and capitalized in conjunction with the requirements under sop  would have been million and per diluted share  respectively 
these capitalized costs were historically expensed prior to the company implementing statement of position on january  compared to revenues

adoption of a rights plan on february   the board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock of the company 
the dividend was payable to stockholders of record on march  the rights  which will initially trade with the common stock  separate and become exercisable only upon the earlier to occur of i days after the date the stock acquisition date of a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated persons has acquired or more of the common stock such person or group being hereinafter referred to as an acquiring person or ii days or such later date as the board of directors shall determine after the commencement of  or announcement of an intention to make  a tender offer or exchange offer that could result in such person or group owning or more of the common stock the earlier of such dates being called the distribution date 
when exercisable  each right initially entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one one hundredth of a share of a newly created class of preferred stock of the company at a purchase price of the purchase price 
the rights are redeemable for per right at the option of the board of directors 
the rights expire on march  if any person becomes an acquiring person  each holder of a right will thereafter have the right the flip in right to receive  in lieu of shares of preferred stock and upon payment of the purchase price  shares of common stock having a value equal to two times the purchase price of the right

external factors the business of recovering subrogation and related claims for healthcare payors is subject to a wide variety of external factors 
prominent among these are factors that would materially change the healthcare payment  fault based liability or workers compensation systems 
because the company s profitability depends in large measure upon obtaining and using claims data  and the availability of property and casualty and workers compensation coverages as sources of recovery  changes in laws that would limit or bar either the access to or use of claims data or the ability of healthcare payors to recover subrogation and related claims represent an ongoing risk to the company 
moreover  because the company s revenues derive from the recovery of the costs of medical treatment of accidents  material changes in such costs will tend to affect the company s revenue or its rate of revenue growth 
the healthcare industry  and particularly the business of healthcare payors  is subject to various external factors that may have the effect of significantly altering the costs of healthcare 
the company is unable to predict which of these factors  if any  could have a potentially material impact on healthcare payors and through them  the healthcare subrogation recovery industry 
the company provides services to healthcare plans that as of december  covered approximately million lives 
hcri s clients are national and regional healthcare payors  large third party administrators or self insured corporations 
during and  hcri s largest clients generated   and  and  and  respectively  of hcri s revenues 
the loss of one or more of these accounts could have a material adverse effect on hcri s business  results of operations and financial condition 
on december   hcri had backlog of million 
hcri s revenues are earned under written contracts with its clients that generally provide for contingency fees from recoveries under a variety of pricing regimes 
the pricing arrangements offered by hcri to its clients include a fixed fee percentage  a fee percentage that declines as the number of lives covered by the client and subject to hcri s service increases and a fee percentage that varies with hcri s recovery performance 
year issues the year presents a problem for computer systems software and hardware that were not designed to handle any dates beyond the year the problem is pervasive and complex because virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the last two digits of the year in consequence  any such software and hardware will need to be modified some time prior to december   in order to remain functional 
computer systems that do not properly handle this rollover could generate erroneous data or fail to function 
the company has initiated a company wide program to identify and address the modifications to or replacements of computer code including data received from clients  hardware and office equipment  the testing and the implementation procedures necessary to achieve year readiness yk readiness or descriptively  yk ready 
as a result of this program  all functions within the company have been surveyed in order to first  identify software and hardware that are not presently yk ready  and secondly  to establish a schedule for remediation or replacement of the items of software and hardware that are not yk ready 
the company has completed its identification of the elements of its software and hardware that are not yk ready 
included among these elements are certain fields contained in the subrosystem  the company s on line subrogation system 
the first date of potential failure for all of these items of software and hardware  including the subrosystem  is january  the completion date for replacement or remediation of all elements of company software  including the subrosystem  and hardware which are not already yk ready  is september  although the company had previously estimated a june  completion date  the company directed certain resources during the fourth quarter of to facilitate acquisitions and certain other matters which caused the delay 
to date  the costs of the company s efforts to achieve yk readiness have not exceeded  and are not expected to exceed  in total 
management believes that the greatest risk posed to the company s yk readiness lies in the possible failure of its clients and other members of the healthcare payor industry to achieve yk readiness 
the company relies on its clients to provide electronic claims data  through electronic data interfaces  as the source of information from which the company identifies potentially recoverable claims 
if clients are unable to provide such data because they are not yk ready  the company could suffer a slow down in its recovery efforts  impairing its ability to make the recoveries from which it derives its revenue 
moreover  to the extent that payors which are potential clients fail to achieve yk readiness  hcri s ability to sell to and to install such payors may also be impaired 
with respect to current clients  hcri has undertaken a survey of each client s state of yk readiness 
the company has received notifications from of its client base  representing more than of its installed lives 
all notifications indicated that clients have yk efforts underway 
the company is attempting to obtain surveys from its remaining client base 
however  as the company is relying upon representations of client yk readiness in response to the surveys  the company is closely monitoring progress through available means  and preparing for contingencies  as necessary 
the company s contingency planning calls for  among other things  early identification of alternative means of obtaining electronic claims data should the existing electronic data interfaces with clients fail 
contingency plans are being developed on an as needed  client specific basis  as warranted
