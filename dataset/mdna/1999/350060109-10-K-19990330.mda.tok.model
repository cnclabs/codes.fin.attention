on a fully diluted basis  the company owns approximately of the dm e s common stock 
although the market value of the dm e is not readily determinable  management believes that this investment  regardless of the dm e s powder river basin project  is worth significantly more than its historical cost

in may  with the approval of its shareholders  the company reincorporated from delaware to pennsylvania 
the principal reason for reincorporating the company in pennsylvania was to eliminate the company s liability for delaware franchise tax

in september  the company suspended production at its newport  kentucky pipe coating facility due to unfavorable market conditions 
management is currently evaluating the long term viability of this operation 
management options include resumption of operations  relocation  or sale of the assets 
the net book value of the newport facility coating assets at december  was million 
management continues to evaluate the overall performance of its operations 
a decision to terminate an existing operation could have a material adverse effect on near term earnings but would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
year impact on computer systems because many existing computer programs have been programmed to use a two digit number to represent the year eg  for  the company has analyzed its computer software systems to ensure that they are capable of correctly identifying the year and beyond in all computer transactions 
the company understands the seriousness of this issue and its board of directors has requested an update of the company s year compliance at each board meeting 
the company installed integrated accounting and distribution software licensed from a national vendor in and has periodically installed updated releases of the software to take advantage of technological advances and improvements over prior releases in the ordinary course of business 
the current releases of this vendor s software are year compliant 
the company installed the year compliant release including modifications unrelated to the year issue to suit the company s business in may the company completed the testing of these modifications and placed these systems in production in january management does not anticipate any adverse impact on becoming year compliant 
the costs associated with the installation of the year compliant release are considered by management to be in the ordinary course of business and are not material to its financial results 
in addition  the company has conducted a review of its production equipment and has determined that it is year compliant 
the company has also surveyed key vendors and suppliers to determine the extent of their year compliance readiness and planned action to become year compliant 
the company has minimal direct or indirect computer data transfer with outside customers  vendors and suppliers other than major banks  whose year compliance efforts are well underway 
based on this fact  as well as internal assessments  and formal and informal communications with customers  vendors and suppliers  the company presently believes that the year compliance issue should not have an adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operation or cash flow 
a failure of third party vendors or suppliers to be year compliant could affect these beliefs and is not quantifiable 
the most reasonably likely worse case scenario of failure by the company or its suppliers or customers to resolve year problems would be a temporary inability on the part of the company to timely process orders and to deliver finished products to customers 
delays in meeting customers orders would affect the timing of billings to and payments received from customers in respect of orders and could result in other liabilities 
customers year problems could also delay the timing of payments to the company for orders 
outlook the company has not had a domestic sheet piling supplier since march  revenues from piling products have declined and will continue to be at reduced levels as the company s remaining piling inventory is liquidated 
the company  however  will become chaparral steel s exclusive north american distributor of steel sheet piling and h bearing pile when chaparral s new richmond  virginia facility begins operations 
this mill will produce structural shape beams  sheet piling  h pile sections and other structural shapes and beams 
it is anticipated that this new facility will commence operations in may  with piling production anticipated during the second half of the rail segment of the business depends on one source for fulfilling certain trackwork contracts 
the company has provided million of working capital to this supplier in the form of loans and progress payments 
if  for any reason  this supplier is unable to perform  the company could experience a negative short term effect on earnings 
the company is also dependent on the availability of specially designed weld trains to ship certain products 
the company has experienced delays in certain projects due to the lack of availability of weld trains 
the company can provide no assurances that a solution to the problem will occur in the near term 
a substantial portion of the company s operations are heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects 
significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the operating results of the company 
additionally  governmental actions concerning taxation  tariffs  the environment or other matters could impact the operating results of the company 
the company s operating results may also be affected by adverse weather conditions

the company manages its exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on firm sales commitments by entering into foreign currency forward contracts

the company uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes

at december   these swap agreements had a notional value of  consisting of  at  expiring in january  and  at  expiring in june the swap agreements floating rates are based on libor 
any amounts paid or received under the agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense 
neither the fair market value of the agreements nor the interest expense adjustments associated with the agreements has been material
