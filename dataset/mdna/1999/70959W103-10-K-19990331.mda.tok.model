liquidity and capital resources cash and liquidity requirements the cash requirements of the company are primarily for the acquisition of new dealerships  working capital and the expansion of existing facilities 
historically  these cash requirements have been met through issuances of equity and debt instruments and cash flow from operations 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
during  dealership activities resulted in net cash provided by operations of million 
net cash used by dealerships in investing activities during the year ended december  totaled million  relating primarily to dealership acquisitions  funding provided to uaf and capital expenditures 
dealership financing activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   principally relating to net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
the company finances substantially all of its new and used vehicle inventory under revolving floor plan financing arrangements with various lenders 
the floor plan lenders pay the manufacturer directly with respect to new vehicles 
the company makes monthly interest payments on the amount financed  but is not required to make loan principal repayments prior to the sale of new and used vehicles 
substantially all of the assets of the company s dealerships are subject to security interests granted to their floor plan lending sources 
at december   the company had approximately million of cash available to fund operations and future acquisitions 
in addition  the company is party to a million credit agreement  dated february  as amended the credit agreement  with a group of banks  which was to be used principally for acquisitions 
as of march   million is available for borrowing under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement restricts the company from paying dividends in excess of million in the aggregate 
in addition  the indentures governing the notes limit the company s ability to pay dividends based on a formula which takes into account  among other things  the company s consolidated net income 
the company is a holding company whose assets consist primarily of the indirect ownership of the capital stock of its operating subsidiaries 
consequently  the company s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and their ability to distribute earnings to the company and other advances and payments by such subsidiaries to the company 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the company s auto dealership subsidiaries 
the company was in compliance with the financial covenants in its credit agreement at year end 
nevertheless  the company anticipates that it may not meet the more stringent first quarter net worth covenants contained therein primarily as a result of the charges described above 
the company has commenced discussions with its lenders to amend or waive such covenants if necessary  however  there can be no assurance that if such amendments or waivers are necessary  they will be obtained 
the company s principal source of growth has come from acquisitions of automobile dealerships 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its current operations and commitments relating to extended warranty contracts previously assumed by trace and alpha 
to the extent the company pursues additional significant acquisitions  it may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional bank borrowings 
a public equity offering would require the prior approval of certain automobile manufacturers 
cyclicality unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  historically have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the automotive retailing industry tends to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy 
the company believes that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  interest rates and credit availability 
seasonality the company s combined business is modestly seasonal overall 
the greatest seasonalities exist with the dealerships in the northeast united states  for which the second and third quarters are the strongest with respect to vehicle related sales 
the service and parts business at all dealerships experiences relatively modest seasonal fluctuations 
effects of inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenue or profitability 
the company does not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of its products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no such effect in the future 
the company finances substantially all of its inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on the prime rate or libor 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation 
the company does not believe that it would be placed at a competitive disadvantage should interest rates increase due to increased inflation since most other automobile dealers have similar floating rate borrowing arrangements 
impact of year many existing computer systems and related applications use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
as the year approaches  such programs may be unable to distinguish years beginning with from years beginning with as a result  date sensitive systems and related applications may fail to process data accurately  before  during or after the year the company is currently analyzing the potential for year issues to impact the operations and management of its auto dealerships 
the company s auto dealerships rely heavily upon two mission critical systems dealer management systems dms and dealer communication systems dcs 
the dms is a leased computer system that supports critical day to day operations of the dealership  including vehicle sales  inventory  service and parts operations and accounting functions 
the dcs is a communication system through which the dealerships exchange information with the manufacturer for processes such as ordering vehicles and parts  submitting warranty claims  reporting financial information and receiving technical information for vehicle service activities 
the company has received assurances from each of the providers of these systems that year compliant versions of the systems have been developed and are available to the company as part of the recurring maintenance of such systems 
to date  the installation of the year compliant dms and dcs systems has been completed at more than ninety percent of the company s dealerships 
the remaining dealerships are expected to have installed the year compliant systems by april  in order to test the ability of the company s recently upgraded mission critical systems to process date related information correctly  the company has established a redundant computer platform which is being used to evaluate the reliability of such systems 
the majority of such testing is expected to be completed by may  while the testing of the mission critical systems is still pending  the company has received assurances that the vendors supplying such systems have made all corrections necessary to the systems to ensure date related information is processed correctly 
the cost of the upgraded mission critical systems is included in the recurring fees paid by the company to the system providers 
as a result  the implementation of such systems has not resulted in incremental cost to the company 
the company is also attempting to verify that the critical services provided by external service providers  such as vehicle and parts manufacturers and suppliers  public utilities and financial institutions with which the company conducts business  will be available without interruption during the transition to the year financial institutions with which the auto dealerships conduct critical business activities include floorplan lending sources and retail lending institutions 
in the event such service providers are unable to verify their ability to address year issues  the company will explore alternative sources for such services 
if the company s current service providers fail to address year issues  and if the company is unable to secure such services from an alternative service provider  then such failure could result in a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition to the mission critical systems and critical services noted above  the dealerships utilize a variety of non critical devices and systems containing embedded systems which may fail to process data accurately  before  during or after the year such non critical devices and systems include personal computers  software applications  service lifts and certain other equipment used by service technicians  phone systems and alarms 
the company has developed a summary list of potential year issues for its dealerships  which is based on an industry guide designed to help dealerships address year issues  as well as on information obtained through in depth reviews of the potential impact of year issues at certain company dealerships 
each of the company s dealerships is scheduled to have completed a thorough review designed to identify such non mission critical systems and devices by april  in addition  each dealership is expected to have addressed these non mission critical systems by december  the cost of correcting the non mission critical systems and devices is not expected to cost in excess of million  which will be paid for from the cash flow from operations of the individual dealerships 
despite the company s efforts and testing  there is a risk that not all possible problems associated with the year issue will be corrected 
further  despite assurances that the company has received or will receive  there can be no guarantee that the systems and services provided by vendors  or that the systems of other companies with which the company does business  will be year compliant 
any such non compliance could result in the reduction or shutdown of the retail sale of automobiles and ancillary products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company

all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this annual report or incorporated herein by reference regarding the company s financial position and business strategy may constitute forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations  some of which are described in greater detail elsewhere in this annual report  include the following i the company is subject to the influence of various manufacturers whose franchises it holds  ii the company is leveraged and subject to restrictions imposed by the terms of its indebtedness  iii the company s growth depends in large part on the company s ability to manage expansion  control costs in its operations and consummate and consolidate dealership acquisitions  iv many of the company s franchise agreements impose restrictions on the transferability of the company s common stock  v the company will require substantial additional capital to acquire automobile dealerships and purchase inventory  vi unit sales of motor vehicles historically have been cyclical  vii the automotive retailing industry is highly competitive  viii the automotive retailing industry is a mature industry  ix the company s success depends to a significant extent on key members of its management  and x the company s business is seasonal 
in light of the foregoing  readers of this annual report are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s business is conducted in the united states and its revenues and expenses are transacted solely in us dollars 
as a result  the company s results of operations are not subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and  accordingly  the company does not hedge against such fluctuations 
in common with other automobile retailers  the company purchases certain of its new car inventories from foreign manufacturers 
the company s business in this regard is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
the company s future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in the interest rates on certain of its outstanding indebtedness 
the outstanding balance under the credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate based on a margin over the prevailing london interbank offered rate libor 
based on the amount outstanding as of march   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to the company s annual interest expense 
similarly  amounts owing under the revolving floor plan financing arrangements  pursuant to which the company finances substantially all of its vehicle inventory  bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over libor 
based on the average aggregate outstanding amounts under such financing arrangements for the year ended december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to the company s annual floor plan interest expense 
for fixed rate debt such as the notes  certain seller financed promissory notes and obligations under certain capital leases  interest rate changes effect the fair market value thereof  but do not impact earnings or cash flows
