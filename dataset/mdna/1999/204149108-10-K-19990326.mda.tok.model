disclosures regarding year many companies have undertaken major projects to address year readiness  which relates to the recognition of dates beyond many software programs and hardware systems are in a two digit format which will not properly process into the next century 
community trust bancorp  inc has already taken the steps to be year compliant 
community trust bancorp  inc realized the importance of year readiness early and committed the people and resources to prepare its systems for january  and beyond 
achieving year readiness is the company s top technology priority 
early on we formed both a year executive steering committee consisting of our top executives and top management  along with a year working team made up of employees from each key business area 
these company leaders have taken responsibility to identify and repair instances where dates may not process correctly within their area of operation and to test for interdependencies with clients  vendors and other corporate units 
we have identified and contacted the bank s significant vendors to inquire about their own year readiness plans  and are tracking and monitoring their progress 
to ensure that all areas are covered  these efforts are coordinated and tracked centrally by the year working team and reported to the year executive steering committee and the board of directors on a regular basis 
awareness complete we defined the year problem and allocated the appropriate resources necessary to perform our compliance work 
we established both a year executive steering committee and a year working team and developed an overall strategy for our year efforts that encompasses in house systems  service bureaus for systems that are outsourced  vendors  auditors  customers  and suppliers 
assessment phase complete we then assessed the size and complexity of the problem and the magnitude of the effort necessary to address our year issues 
this phase identified all hardware  software  networks  automated teller machines  and other processing platforms  along with customer and vendor interdependencies affected by the year date change 
we have completed an inventory of systems in the bank  prioritized those that were identified  and made detailed plans to renovate and test modifications to make them year ready 
our assessment went well beyond information systems and included environmental systems that are dependent on embedded microchips  such as security systems  elevators  and vaults 
renovation phase in process strategies were developed for the code enhancements  hardware renovation or replacements  software upgrades and vendor certification  along with other associated changes 
this work was prioritized based on the information gathered during our assessment phase 
a millennium test site was developed to assure that testing of our hardware and software could occur outside of our working environment before being implemented on our production systems 
plans were made for on going communications and monitoring of our key vendors  third party service providers  and software providers throughout our year project timeline 
the planned date of completion is march  validation phase in process testing  while inherent in each phase  plays a key role in the success of our entire year project 
this phase includes testing of all incremental changes to hardware and software components  along with interfaces and connections with other systems 
also  validation from both internal and external users is required 
during this phase  monitoring and communications with our service and software vendors will be maintained to assure these vendor efforts are tracked and their progress closely monitored 
our core third party data processor  one of the country s leading suppliers of financial institution data processing services  has already installed year upgrades to their data processing systems 
we have performed substantial off site testing of this upgrade and have scheduled on site testing for the first quarter of implementation phase in process our data processing systems will be certified as year compliant 
for any system failing certification  the business effect will be clearly assessed and the organization s year contingency plans will be implemented 
this phase will also ensure that any new systems or subsequent changes to verified systems are compliant with year requirements 
we have completed testing and determined that all of our major systems are year ready 
we have also verified that our systems will recognize that is a leap year  and continue to work closely with our client and vendor companies to verify that they also are prepared for the century date change 
in addition  we have drafted our business resumption plan which provides contingency plans for all identified year issues 
the costs associated with the year project were  in and are estimated to be  in because community trust bancorp  inc is utilizing internal staff for the management and implementation of its year compliance program  it does not expect to incur any material costs with outside contractors 
subsequently  it does not anticipate a material increase in operating costs to be incurred 
the cost of the year project and the date by which the company believes it will be year compliant are based upon management s current best estimates  which were derived based upon numerous assumptions of future events  including availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
actual results could vary from those anticipated 
liquidity the company s objectives are to ensure that funds are available at the subsidiary bank and thrift to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability  and to ensure that funding is available for the parent company to meet it s ongoing cash needs while maximizing profitability 
the company continues to identify ways to provide for liquidity on both a current and long term basis 
on a long term basis  the subsidiary bank and thrift rely mainly on core deposits  certificates of deposit of  or more  repayment of principal and interest on loans and securities  as well as federal funds sold and purchased 
the subsidiary bank and thrift also rely on the sale of securities under repurchase agreements  securities available for sale and federal home loan bank borrowings 
deposits increased from billion at december  to billion at december  this increase was in large part due to the acquisition of approximately million in deposits through the acquisition of seven branches in west virginia and twelve branches in central kentucky 
taking advantage of this increase in liquidity  the company decreased its borrowings of federal funds  federal home loan bank borrowings  and other short term borrowings while establishing a federal funds sold position of million 
due to the nature of the markets served by the banking regions  management believes that the majority of its certificates of deposit of  or more are no more volatile than its core deposits 
during the periods of low interest rates  these deposit balances remained stable as a percentage of total deposits 
in addition  the company is able to borrow funds with several correspondent banks  to meet the company s liquidity needs 
the company owns million of securities designated as available for sale and valued at market which are available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
the company also relies on federal home loan bank advances for both liquidity and management of its asset liability position 
federal home loan bank advances decreased from million at december  to million at december  the company generally relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash for its investing activities 
as is typical of many financial institutions  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the company has million of a million credit line available beyond  in the form of a revolving line of credit see note long term debt 
the company s primary investing activities include purchases of investment securities and loan originations 
in conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity  management monitors the degree of interest rate risk assumed on the balance sheet 
the company monitors its interest rate risk by the use of static and dynamic gap models at the one year interval 
the static gap model monitors the difference in interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities as a percentage of total assets that mature within the specified time frame 
the dynamic gap model goes further in that it assumes that interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be reinvested 
the company uses the sendero system to monitor its interest rate risk 
the company desires an interest sensitivity gap of not more than fifteen percent of total assets at the one year interval 
the company s static interest rate gap position as of december  is presented below interest rate sensitivity analysis december  total over in thousands months months year year total interest earning assets securities and deposits      loans      total earning assets      interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings accounts     time deposits      federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings     advances from fhlb     long term debt     total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap for the period      cumulative      cumulative as a percent of earning assets capital resources total shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  the primary source of capital of the company is retained earnings 
cash dividends were per share for and per share for regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies  commercial banks  and savings banks to maintain certain minimum ratios and define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios 
the banking regulators may alter minimum capital requirements as a result of revising their internal policies and their ratings of individual institutions 
to be well capitalized banks and bank holding companies must maintain a tier leverage ratio of no less than  a tier risk based ratio of no less than and a total risk based ratio of no less than 
the company s ratios as of december  were  and  respectively 
community trust bancorp  inc meets the definition of adequately capitalized and all banking affiliates met the criteria for well capitalized at december  as of december   management is not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations
