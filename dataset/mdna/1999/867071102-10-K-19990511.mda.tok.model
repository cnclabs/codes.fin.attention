asset impairment and other charges goodwill when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  the company estimates future cash flows using the recoverability method undiscounted future cash flows and including related interest charges as a basis for recording any impairment loss 
an impairment loss is then recorded to adjust the carrying value of goodwill to the recoverable amount 
the impairment loss taken is no greater than the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets of the business exceeds its fair value 
due to first alert s financial performance in and its prospects in and beyond  the company determined that the goodwill relating to this acquisition was impaired 
accordingly  based on its determination of fair value  the company has written off the net carrying value of goodwill of million in the fourth quarter of fixed asset impairment and excess and obsolete inventory reserves in the second quarter of  the company decided to outsource or discontinue a substantial number of products previously made by the company  resulting in certain facilities and equipment that will either no longer be used or will be utilized in a significantly different manner 
accordingly  a charge of million was recorded in cost of goods sold to write certain of these assets down to their estimated fair market market value 
approximately of this charge related to machinery  equipment and tooling at the company s mexico city and hattiesburg  mississippi manufacturing plants  the estimated fair value for which was derived through an auction process

these fixed assets were taken out of service at the time of the write down and consequently were not depreciated further after the write down 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge as a result of management s decision to outsource the production of certain appliances 
this charge to cost of goods sold primarily consists of a provision for certain tooling and equipment million and severance and related benefits million 
the tooling and equipment was written down to its estimated fair value which was derived from comparable market data 
this equipment was taken out of service and depreciation of this equipment was discontinued at the time of the write down 
during and the first half of  the company built inventories in anticipation of sales volumes which did not materialize 
as a result  it has been and will continue to be necessary to dispose of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost

this inventory primarily related to certain appliances  grills and grill accessories 
the company also recorded a charge of million for excess inventories for raw materials and work in process which will not be used due to outsourcing the production of irons  breadmakers  toasters and certain other appliances

restatements on june   sunbeam announced that the audit committee was initiating a review into the accuracy of sunbeam s prior financial statements 
the audit committee s review has since been completed and  as a result of its findings  sunbeam has restated its previously issued consolidated financial statements for and and the first quarter of based upon the review  it was determined that certain revenue had been inappropriately recognized  certain costs and allowances had not been accrued or were improperly recorded  and certain costs were inappropriately included in  and subsequently charged to  restructuring  asset impairment and other costs within the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and december  and the three months ended march  the financial statements for the years ended december  and december  were audited and filed on form k a with the sec on november  the accompanying consolidated financial statements present the restated results 
in connection with the restatements referred to above  the company was advised by arthur andersen that there existed conditions that arthur andersen believed to be material weaknesses in the company s internal control 
see item changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 
in order to address these material weaknesses  the company has increased the number of senior financial personnel and has implemented comprehensive review procedures of operating and financial information 
additionally  as explained in more detail under year readiness disclosure within item  the company is in the process of significantly enhancing its operating systems 
the company anticipates that its systems enhancements will be completed in year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of coleman from march  and of signature brands and first alert from april   the respective dates of the acquisition 
the acquired entities generated net sales of  million from the acquisition dates noted above through december   with corresponding gross margin of million  or of sales 
sg a costs recorded by the acquired entities were million in the period  yielding an operating loss of million 
for the acquired entities  net sales from the dates of the acquisitions through fiscal year end were approximately million lower than the sales for the same period in the prior year 
this decline was caused by lower net sales at coleman million  signature brands million and first alert million 
excluding the effects of coleman s sale of its safety and security business in march and the discontinuation of its pressure washer business during  coleman s sales would have been approximately million lower than in the company believes that signature brands decline  primarily in its coffee and tea products  resulted largely from lost distribution and insufficient attention to the business during part of the company believes that all of the acquired businesses were  to some extent  impacted by the disruption that arose from the integration with sunbeam and the related management changes  both at the acquired companies and at sunbeam 
first alert s sales decline related predominately to increased inventory positions in the domestic channel in as compared to with the remaining decrease primarily related to more favorable weather conditions in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in which affected consumer shopping patterns 
excluding the effects from purchase accounting and the write off of first alert s goodwill  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  operating profit for these three companies declined by approximately million since the dates of the acquisitions in as compared to the same period in the prior year  resulting primarily from lower net sales 
although there can be no assurance  management anticipates that results from the acquired companies will significantly improve during due to  among other things  the absence of the factors causing disruption and insufficient focus at these three companies during consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were  million  an increase of million versus the year ended december  after excluding i  million of sales generated by the acquired entities  as discussed above  ii million of sales in resulting from the change in fiscal year end  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  iii million in and million in from sales of excess or discontinued inventory for which the inventory carrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value  iv million from sales relating to divested product lines which are not classified as discontinued operations time and temperature products and counselor and borg branded scales  and v a million benefit in from the reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer required cooperative advertising costs are recorded as deductions in determining net sales  net sales on an adjusted basis adjusted sales of million decreased approximately from adjusted sales of  million in product sales were adversely impacted by a number of factors  with the largest being changes in retail inventory levels from channel loading which took place in the company believes the year to year effect of such inventory reductions amounted to over million 
additionally  losses in distribution of outdoor cooking products estimated at approximately million  the estimated effect of price discounting on appliance and grill products of approximately million  and estimated higher provisions for customer returns and allowances of approximately million contributed to the lower sales in the remaining sales decline was due in part to exiting certain product sku s 
domestic adjusted sales declined approximately or million from the company believes more than half of the sales decline was due to increased retail inventory levels in versus decreased inventory positions at customers in excluding this effect  sales were still lower than the prior year throughout the business  with the most significant decline occurring in outdoor cooking products sales 
during  the company lost a significant portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution  including the majority of its grill parts and accessories products distribution 
the outdoor cooking products sales decline was attributable predominately to this lost distribution and to price discounting 
the majority of the remaining sales decline was due to higher provisions for customer returns and allowances 
international sales  which represented of adjusted sales for  decreased approximately compared with the adjusted sales for the same period a year ago 
the company believes this sales decline was primarily attributable to decreasing customer inventory levels as compared with the prior year 
sales were also adversely impacted by a decision to stop selling to certain export distributors in latin america and by poor economic conditions in that region 
in addition  lost distribution in canada contributed to the sales decline from the prior year 
excluding the effect of i the gross margin generated from the inclusion of the acquired entities operations in the period of million  as discussed above  ii million from the impact of the change in fiscal year end  iii million in in charges recorded in the second and fourth quarters related to excess inventory and fixed assets impairments  iv million from the benefit in from the reversal of reserves no longer required  including million of cooperative advertising accruals and v a million benefit recorded in the second quarter of resulting from capitalizing certain manufacturing supplies inventories which were previously expensed  there was a negative gross margin of million for versus a gross margin of million for lower sales volume and unfavorable manufacturing efficiencies from lower production levels associated with the lower sales volumes and high inventory levels in accounted for approximately of the change between years 
approximately of the remaining decrease is attributable to lower price realization and higher costs of customer returns and allowances in and adverse product sales mix in the adverse product sales mix was due in part to the loss of a majority of the grill accessory products distribution as accessories generate significantly better margins than the average margins on sales of most of the company s other products 
costs associated with a blanket recall  higher warranty reserves and inventory adjustments due in part to physical inventories drove the remaining decrease in gross margin 
excluding the effect of i million of sg a charges in the acquired entities  including the million goodwill write off related to first alert  ii million recorded in the third quarter of related to the issuance of warrants  iii million of sg a expense in from the change in the fiscal period  iv a million benefit in and a million benefit in from the reversal of reserves no longer required  v approximately million of compensation expense recorded in connection with new employment agreements with the company s former chairman and chief executive officer and two other former senior officers and approximately million of severance in for certain former employees  vi million  million  and million of costs recorded in related to costs associated with the restatement efforts  year compliance efforts and a corporate office relocation  respectively  and vii million of restructuring related charges recorded in  sg a expenses were approximately million in  higher than the same period in this increase of approximately million is due to several factors 
corporate administrative costs increased by approximately million  reflecting additional personnel and related relocation  travel and other costs  as well as increased outside provider fees  telecommunications expense and insurance 
higher allowances for accounts receivable in  accounting for approximately million of the increase  related primarily to collection issues with certain customers in the us and in latin america  including several major customers who have filed and or threatened bankruptcy 
advertising  marketing and selling expenses increased by approximately million  reflecting a national television campaign for grills and increased activity in market research  package design and sales efforts 
higher inventory levels in and costs associated with outsourcing small parts fulfillment led to higher distribution and warehousing costs of approximately million 
increased environmental reserves for divested and closed facilities added approximately million while settlement of a patent infringement action resulted in additional expense of approximately million 
during  the company determined that the amounts accrued at december  for restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal exceeded amounts ultimately required 
accordingly  the consolidated statement of operations reflects the reversal of accruals no longer required  resulting in a restructuring and asset impairment benefit of million 
this reversal was reflected in the third million and fourth million quarters of when it became evident that such accruals were no longer required 
operating results for and  on an adjusted basis as described above  were a loss of approximately million in and a profit of approximately million in this change resulted from the factors discussed above 
interest expense increased from million for the twelve months of to million for the same period in approximately of the change related to higher borrowing levels in for the acquisitions  with the remainder due to increased borrowings to fund working capital  capital expenditures and the operating losses 
other income  net increased in by million due to approximately million from the settlement of a lawsuit  and approximately million of increased net gains from foreign exchange in the period 
the foreign exchange net gains were primarily from mexico 
increased losses on sales of fixed assets of approximately million and increased expenses related to the new credit facility partially offset the above mentioned income 
the increased credit facility expenses largely related to unused facility fees 
the minority interest reported in relates to the minority interest held in coleman by public shareholders 
during  the current tax provision arose largely from taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as franchise taxes 
deferred tax benefits were recognized in principally due to net operating losses incurred subsequent to the acquisitions 
these benefits were realized through the use of deferred tax credits that were established in connection with the acquisitions to the extent that such credits are expected to be realized in the loss carryforward period 
during  the company increased the income tax valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to million 
this increase reflects management s assessment that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income 
the effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state taxes  the effects of foreign earnings and dividends taxed at other rates and the impact of providing a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
in  the company prepaid certain debt assumed in the acquisitions and prepaid an industrial revenue bond related to its hattiesburg facility 
in connection with these early extinguishments of debt  the company recognized an extraordinary charge of million  consisting primarily of redemption premiums 
the company s discontinued furniture business  which was sold in march  had revenues of million in the first quarter of prior to the sale and nominal earnings for that period 
as a result of the sale of the company s furniture business assets primarily inventory  property  plant and equipment  the company received million in cash  retained approximately million in accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities 
the final purchase price for the furniture business was subject to a post closing adjustment based on the terms of the sale agreement and in the first quarter of  after completion of the sale  the company recorded an additional loss on disposal of million  net of applicable income tax benefits of million

the asset write downs of million included equipment taken out of service in either abandoned in or sold in and accordingly  depreciation was not recorded subsequent to the date of the impairment charge 
the losses of million related to the divestiture of non core products and businesses resulted from divesting of the time and temperature business sold in march and counselor and borg scale product lines sold in may and the sale of the textile mill in biddeford  maine in may these charges primarily represented the estimated non cash loss to exit these products  including fixed assets and inventory write downs and other costs related to exiting these product lines 
the million for severance and other employee costs  including cobra and other fringe benefits  related to approximately  positions that were planned to be eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan  excluding approximately  employees terminated from the furniture business for which severance was included in loss on sale of discontinued operations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the furniture business was sold in in and  approximately  employees and  employees  respectively  were terminated from continuing operations 
due largely to attrition  the remaining planned terminations were not required 
in  the company determined that its severance and related employee costs were less than originally accrued principally due to lower than expected severance and cobra costs and  accordingly  reversed accruals of million in the third and fourth quarters 
at december   the balance accrued of million represented the remaining severance and related employee costs for certain employees terminated during during  all amounts were expended 
the amounts accrued at december  for restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal  exceeded amounts ultimately required principally due to reductions in anticipated severance costs of million  as discussed above  and reductions in estimated lease payments of million resulting from better than anticipated rentals received under sub leases and favorable negotiation of lease terminations 
accordingly  the fiscal consolidated statement of operations included million of benefit million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of related to the reversal of accruals no longer required  which were recorded as these reduced obligations became known 
in  in conjunction with the initiation of the restructuring plan  the company recorded additional charges totaling million  reflected in cost of goods sold  sg a expense  and loss on sale of discontinued operations

as further discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of  the company charged sg a expense for increases of million in environmental reserves and million in litigation reserves 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed a comprehensive review of all environmental exposures in an attempt by the then new senior management team to accelerate the resolution and settlement of environmental claims 
as a result  upon the conclusion of the review  the company recorded additional environmental reserves of million in the fourth quarter of the litigation charge of million was recorded due to an unfavorable court ruling in january  which held that the company was liable for environmental remediation costs related to the operations of a successor company 
as a result of this ruling  the company provided for this liability in the fourth quarter of in  this case was settled and  as a result  million of the charge was reversed into income  primarily in the fourth quarter of as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company also charged million to sg a expenses in for compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards and other costs related to the employment of the then new senior management team 
during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  of pre tax liabilities provided in prior years and determined to be no longer required were reversed and taken into income 
these amounts were primarily related to the litigation reserve million discussed above  inventory valuation allowances million  cooperative advertising allowances million  liabilities for exiting of facilities and plant consolidations provided for prior to million and consulting fee accruals million 
these liabilities were provided for by the company  principally in  based upon its best available estimate at the time of the probable liabilities

adjusted sales growth was approximately for appliances and approximately in outdoor cooking 
adjusted sales for health products increased approximately while adjusted sales of personal care products and blankets decreased approximately during sales increases in appliances of approximately million  were driven by new products  such as re designed blenders and mixers  coffeemakers  irons  deep fryers and toasters  coupled with increased distribution with large national mass retailers  combined with higher inventory levels at certain customers 
sales of outdoor cooking products increased approximately million in attributed to increased merchandising and advertising programs  new distribution and higher inventory levels at certain customers 
during  the company lost a significant portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution  including the majority of its grill accessory products distribution 
accessories  which accounted for just over of the outdoor cooking sales volume in  generate significantly better margins than the average margins on sales of grills 
these distribution changes are expected to adversely impact outdoor cooking sales and margins in the future  until such time as the distribution is regained 
sales of personal care products and blankets suffered during the fourth quarter of as a result of lower than expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern markets in late coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queen sized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells 
this resulted in a sales decline of approximately million as compared with the prior year 
the company shifted to a more level production for blankets in in order to more adequately service the seasonal demand for bedding products 
sales of health products as well as personal care and bedding products were impacted by increased inventory positions at customers in international sales  which represented of total revenues in  grew during the year 
this sales growth was driven primarily by new volt product introductions and a general improvement in demand in export operations and in mexico 
net sales growth of approximately was achieved in the latin american export sales organization 
most of this growth came from increased business with three exporters 
in mexico and venezuela  sales grew and  respectively 
canada accounted for the majority of the remaining international sales growth 
excluding the effect of i charges to cost of goods sold related to the restructuring plan in million  ii the benefit of reducing reserves no longer required in million  and iii the benefit in of capitalizing manufacturing supplies inventories million  gross margin as a percent of adjusted sales would have been approximately in  an improvement of approximately percentage points from in this increase reflects the results of lower overhead spending  improved factory utilization and labor cost benefits resulting from the company s restructuring plan  coupled with reductions in certain materials costs 
the lower overhead spending resulted from a reduction in the number of facilities operated by the company 
with fewer facilities used for production purposes  the capacity of the remaining plants was more fully utilized 
the labor cost benefits were realized principally from shifting production to mexico 
in addition  a broad based program to obtain lower costs for materials contributed to the margin improvement 
excluding the impact of i the restructuring and asset impairment period costs to sg a expense in million and million  ii the charges for the environmental accrual million  litigation accrual million  and restricted stock grant compensation million  and iii the benefit from the reversal of reserves no longer required million  sg a expense improved to of adjusted sales in  down percentage points from in this improvement was partially the result of benefits from the consolidation of six divisional and regional headquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operations center  reduced staffing levels  a reduction in the number of warehouses  and company wide cost control initiatives 
higher expenditures in for market research  new packaging and other discretionary charges and higher bad debt expenses associated with certain of the company s customers also contributed to the decrease in sg a expenses from to the expense for doubtful accounts and cash discounts was million in as compared to million in the principal factor in the decrease in bad debt expenses during this period was the acceleration of the consolidation of the us retail industry and the related competitive environment  which resulted in a number of troubled retailers and related bankruptcies during this resulted in the significant amount of bad debt write offs million in operating results for and  on a comparable basis as described above  were earnings of million in and a loss of million in on the same basis  operating margin increased percentage points to of adjusted sales in versus a loss of in this improvement resulted from the factors discussed above 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was higher than the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state taxes plus the effect of foreign earnings and dividends taxed at other rates and the increase to the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets  offset in part by the reversal of tax liabilities no longer required 
in the fourth quarter of  the company increased the valuation allowance by million reflecting management s assessment that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized through future taxable income 
of this amount  million related to deferred tax assets  the majority of which was recognized as a benefit in the first three quarters of the remainder related to minimum pension liabilities and was therefore recorded as an adjustment to shareholders equity 
this assessment was made as a result of the significant leverage undertaken by the company as part of the acquisitions and the significant decline in net sales and earnings from anticipated levels during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of for  the effective income tax rate for continuing operations equaled the federal statutory income tax rate 
the company s diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was per share in versus a loss per share from continuing operations in of 
the company s share base utilized in the diluted earnings per share calculation increased approximately during as a result of an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding due to the exercise of stock options in and the inclusion of common stock equivalents in the calculation 
the company s discontinued furniture business  which was sold in march  had revenues of million in the first quarter of prior to the sale and nominal earnings

although the discontinued furniture business was profitable  net income had declined from million in to million in this decline  along with the company s announcement that it intended to divest this line of business contributed to the loss on the sale

seasonality sunbeam s sales  prior to the acquisitions  have not traditionally exhibited substantial seasonality  however  sales have been strongest during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
additionally  sales of outdoor cooking products are strongest in the first half of the year  while sales of appliances  personal care and blanket products are strongest in the second half of the year 
after considering the seasonality of the acquired entities  sunbeam s consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantial seasonality  however  sales are expected to be strongest during the second quarter of the calendar year 
furthermore  sales of a number of products  including warming blankets  vaporizers  humidifiers  grills  first alert products  camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions 
liquidity and capital resources in order to finance the acquisition of coleman  first alert and signature brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of the company and the three acquired entities  the company consummated an offering of debentures at a yield to maturity of approximately  million principal amount at maturity in march  which resulted in approximately million of net proceeds and entered into the new credit facility 
the debentures are exchangeable for shares of the company s common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount at maturity of the debentures  subject to adjustment upon occurrence of certain events 
the debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company

the company may  at its option  elect to pay any such purchase price in cash or common stock or any combination thereof 
the company was required to file a registration statement with the sec to register the debentures by june  this registration statement was filed on february  and the sec has not declared the registration statement effective 
sunbeam s failure to file the registration statement by june  did not constitute default under the terms of the debentures 
as part of the normal review process by the sec  a number of comments have been made by the staff of the division of corporation finance relating to the registration statement and the restated and financial statements included therein 
the company expects to resolve these comments when it files an amendment to the registration statement 
from june  until the registration statement is declared effective  the company is required to pay to the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing  for each day during such period  at a rate per annum equal to during the first days and thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of the debentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day 
the company made its first payment of approximately million to the debenture holders on september  and an additional million was paid on march  concurrent with the acquisitions  the company replaced its million syndicated unsecured five year revolving credit facility with the new credit facility 
the new credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to billion 
as a result of operating losses incurred in fiscal  among other things  the company was not in compliance with certain covenants set forth in the new credit facility 
the company and its lenders entered into agreements as of june   october  and april   in each case providing for waivers of compliance with such covenants under the new credit facility 
effective april   sunbeam and its lenders entered into an agreement which waived compliance with such covenants through april  and provided for new financial covenants 
the following description of the new credit facility reflects the terms of the new credit facility as amended through april the new credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to billion pursuant to i a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million maturing march  million of which may only be used to complete the coleman merger if the coleman merger is not completed prior to august   ii million in term loans maturing on march  of which million may only be used to complete the coleman merger and iii a million term loan maturing september  as of december   approximately billion was outstanding and approximately billion was available for borrowing under the new credit facility 
pursuant to the new credit facility  interest accrues  at the company s option i at the london interbank offered rate libor or ii at the base rate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the federal funds rate plus  in each case plus an agreed upon interest margin which is currently for libor borrowings and for base rate borrowings 
the applicable interest margin is subject to downward adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
borrowings under the new credit facility are secured by a pledge of the stock of the company s material subsidiaries  including coleman  and by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of sunbeam and its material domestic subsidiaries  other than coleman and its material subsidiaries except as described below 
currently  coleman s inventory and related assets are pledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its account under the new credit facility 
additionally  as security for coleman s note payable to the company  coleman pledged substantially all of its domestic assets  other than real property  including of the stock of its direct foreign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiaries  and all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not the assets of coleman s subsidiaries 
the pledge runs in favor of sunbeam s lending banks  to which the coleman note has been pledged as security for sunbeam s obligations to them 
upon completion of the coleman merger  substantially all of coleman s assets and the assets of coleman s domestic subsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the new credit facility 
in addition  borrowings under the new credit facility are guaranteed by a number of the company s wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries and these subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above 
upon completion of the coleman merger  coleman and each of its united states subsidiaries will become guarantors of the obligations under the new credit facility 
to the extent borrowings are made by any subsidiaries of the company  the obligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the company 
the new credit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similar nature  including limitations on the ability of sunbeam and its subsidiaries  including coleman  to  among other things  i declare dividends or repurchase stock  ii prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  incur liens and engage in sale leaseback transactions  iii make loans and investments  iv incur additional debt  v amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into restrictive agreements  vi make capital and year compliance expenditures  vii engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  viii engage in certain transactions with affiliates  ix settle certain litigation  x alter its cash management system and xi alter the businesses they conduct

the new credit facility provides for events of default customary for transactions of this type  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenant  cross defaults  bankruptcy  material adverse change arising from compliance with erisa  material adverse judgments  entering into guarantees and change of ownership and control 
it is also an event of default under the new credit facility if sunbeam s registration statement in connection with the coleman merger is not declared effective by the sec on or before october  or if the merger does not occur within business days of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cash consideration including any payments on account of the exercise of any appraisal rights  but excluding related legal  accounting and other customary fees and expenses to consummate the coleman merger exceeds million 
although there can be no assurance  the company anticipates that it will satisfy these conditions 
unless waived by the bank lenders  the failure to satisfy these requirements as with the occurrence of any other event of default would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the new credit facility 
the new credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral of the scheduled term loan payments of million  subject to delivery of certain collateral documents and the filing of an amendment to the company s registration statement on form s relating to the coleman merger 
if these conditions are met  and there are no events of default  the scheduled loan payments will be extended until april  the company anticipates that it will satisfy these conditions and  accordingly  has classified these amounts as long term in the consolidated balance sheet

in the fourth quarter of  cash provided by operating activities totaled million  principally due to cash generated by reducing receivables and inventories of million  partially offset by the previously discussed reduction in earnings 
the decrease in cash provided by operations from to is primarily attributable to increased inventory levels in and spending in related to the restructuring initiatives accrued for in  largely offset by an increase in cash generated by earnings in and an income tax refund net of payments in cash used in operating activities reflects proceeds of million in and million in from the company s revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program  as more fully described below

although there can be no assurance  it is anticipated that the coleman merger will occur in the second half of fiscal the company is a party to various environmental proceedings  substantially all related to previously divested operations and to coleman sites 
in management s opinion  the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its borrowing capacity under the new credit facility  cash flow from the combined operations of the company and its acquired companies  existing cash and cash equivalent balances  and its receivable securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs  capital and year compliance spending  and debt service through april  however  if the company is unable to obtain a further waiver of the covenant and ratio requirements prior to april   the company expects it would  at that time  be in default of the requirements under the new credit facility and  as noted above  the lenders could then require the repayment of all amounts then outstanding under the new credit facility

year readiness disclosure the company is preparing for the impact of the year on its operations 
year issues could include potential problems in the information technology it and non it systems that the company uses in its operations and problems in the company s products 
year system failures could affect routine but critical operations such as forecasting  purchasing  production  order processing  inventory control  shipping  billing and collection 
in addition  system failures could affect the company s security  payroll operations  or employee safety 
the company may also be exposed to potential risks from third parties with whom the company interacts who fail to adequately address their own year issues 
sunbeam s approach to year issues while the company s year readiness planning has been underway for over one year  during the third quarter of the company established a cross functional project team consisting of senior managers  assisted by three external consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services and to assist the company in implementing its year strategy 
this team is sponsored by the company s chief financial officer who reports directly to the company s chief executive officer on this issue 
the audit committee of the board of directors is advised periodically on the status of the company s year readiness program 
the year project team has developed a phased approach to identify and resolve year issues with many of these activities conducted in parallel 
the company s approach and the anticipated timing of each phase are described below 
phase inventory and assessment during the first phase of sunbeam s year readiness program  the company established a year program management office pmo to centralize the management of all of the company s year projects 
through this office  the company developed a corporate wide  uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the year issues 
the company has completed an inventory of its hardware and software systems  manufacturing equipment  electronic data interchange  telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to year problems  such as security systems and controls for lighting  air conditioning  ventilation and facility access 
this inventory was then entered into the company s year database along with a determination of the item s level of criticality to operations 
for those inventory items anticipated to have a significant effect on the business if not corrected  the company s year program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items 
all information relative to each item is being tracked in the company s year database 
the company completed most of this phase during the third and fourth quarters of the company has completed a review of the readiness of embedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of the company s products have year date sensitive systems 
phase correction and testing the second phase of sunbeam s year readiness program is structured to replace  upgrade or remediate as necessary those items identified during phase as requiring corrective action 
sunbeam relies on its it functions to perform many tasks that are critical to its operations 
significant transactions that could be impacted by not being ready for any year issues include  among others  purchases of materials  production management  order entry and fulfillment  and payroll processing 
systems and applications that have been identified by sunbeam to date as not currently year ready and which are critical to sunbeam s operations include its financial software systems  which process the order entry  purchasing  production management  general ledger  accounts receivable  and accounts payable functions  payroll applications  and critical applications in the company s manufacturing and distribution facilities  such as warehouse management applications 
in  the company began implementing a uniform international business and accounting information system to improve internal reporting processes 
based upon representations from the manufacturer that the current version of this uniform information system is year ready  the company has been actively upgrading its business sites that currently utilize this uniform system to the year ready version 
a small number of other company business locations are replacing their current non year ready systems with this new uniform system 
the company is also actively replacing and or upgrading legacy business systems that are not year ready  including those that use localized business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced by the uniform business and accounting information system 
with respect to the company s non it systems for example  time and attendance  security  and in line manufacturing hardware the company is actively analyzing these items to assess any year issues 
to date  no material issues have been discovered  and the company will continue to review  test and correct  if necessary  such items 
sunbeam plans to complete the corrective work described above with respect to its systems by the second quarter of with final testing and implementation of such systems occurring in the second and third quarters of phase customers  suppliers and business partners the third phase of sunbeam s year readiness program which was initiated during the third and fourth quarters of is designed to assess and interact with the company s customers  suppliers  and business partners 
as part of this effort  the company surveyed  vendors and suppliers determined to be critical to the company 
based on the survey  the company believes that there is only a low to medium risk of year issues for approximately one third of its vendors  however  a small number of vendors have been identified as high risk less than and almost two thirds of the vendors did not respond fully to the survey 
the company will continue its vendor evaluation and assessment process through  including direct contact with high and medium risk vendors and vendors who have not responded fully to the company s survey 
the company has not independently verified the responses of vendors and does not anticipate undertaking such independent verification process 
beginning in the second quarter of  sunbeam will also contact its major customers to confirm their preparations for year issues 
the company has already responded to numerous customer inquiries and believes that all of the company s major customers have established programs to deal with year issues 
in order to improve the company s communication with its customers  suppliers and business partners  the company has set up a sunbeam year telephone number and is in the process of providing year information on a company web site 
phase contingency planning this phase will involve contingency planning for unresolved year issues  particularly any issues arising with third party suppliers 
the company s year readiness program is ongoing and its ultimate scope  as well as the consideration of contingency plans  will continue to be evaluated as new information becomes available 
as a precautionary measure  sunbeam plans to establish a contingency plan for addressing any effects of the year on its operations  whether due to sunbeam s systems or those of third parties not being ready for any year issues 
sunbeam expects to complete such contingency plan by september   such contingency plan will address alternative processes  such as manual procedures  electronic spreadsheets  potential alternative service providers  and plans to address year readiness issues as they arise 
the risks of sunbeam s year approach the independent consultants assisting the company in its year readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the company s approach  have assisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largest single component upgrade or installation of the company s uniform system of the company s year program 
as a result  although the company did not engage an independent third party to verify the program s overall approach or total cost  the company believes that the company s exposure in this regard is mitigated 
in addition  through the use of external third party diagnostic tools which helped to identify potential year issues in one significant business operation  the company believes that it has also mitigated its risk by validating and verifying key program components 
management believes that  although there are significant systems that are being modified or replaced  sunbeam s information systems environment will be made year ready prior to january  sunbeam s failure to timely complete such corrective work could have a material adverse impact on the company 
with respect to customers  suppliers and business partners  the failure of certain of these third parties to become year ready could also have a material adverse impact on sunbeam 
for example  the failure of certain of the company s principal suppliers to have year ready internal systems could impact the company s ability to manufacture and or ship its products or to maintain adequate inventory levels for production 
at this time  the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario relating to year involves potential disruptions in areas in which the company s operations must rely on third parties  such as suppliers  whose systems may not work properly after january  while such system failures could either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the company and its subsidiaries in a significant manner  the company cannot at present estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures 
subject to the nature of the goods or services provided to the company by third parties whose operations are not made ready for year issues  the impact on sunbeam s operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannot be developed prior to january  the nature and focus of the company s efforts to address the year problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issues are identified 
in addition  it is important to note that the description of the company s efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projections with respect to activities required in the future 
these estimates and projections are subject to change as work continues  and such changes may be substantial 
the costs to address the company s year issues through december   sunbeam had expended approximately million to address year issues of which approximately half was recorded as capital expenditures and the remainder as sg a expense 
sunbeam s current assessment of the total costs to address and remedy year issues and enhance its operating systems  including costs for the acquired companies  is approximately million 
the amount to be incurred for year issues during of approximately million represents over of the company s total budget for information systems and related support  including year costs 
a large majority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that will not recur in the year or thereafter 
fees and expenses related to third party consultants  who are involved in the pmo as well as the modification and replacement of software  represent approximately of the total estimated cost 
the balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily to software license fees and new hardware  but excludes the costs associated with company employees 
sunbeam expects these expenditures to be financed through operating cash flows or borrowings  as applicable 
a significant portion of these expenditures will enhance sunbeam s operating systems in addition to resolving the year issues 
as sunbeam completes its assessment of the year issues  the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materially from the amounts shown above 
because year readiness is critical to the business  sunbeam has redeployed some resources from non critical system enhancements to address year issues 
in addition  due to the importance of it systems to the company s business  management has deferred non critical systems enhancements as much as possible 
the company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
effects of inflation for each of the three years in the period ended december   the company s cost of raw materials and other product remained relatively stable 
to the extent possible  the company s objective is to offset the impact of inflation through productivity enhancements  cost reductions and price increases
