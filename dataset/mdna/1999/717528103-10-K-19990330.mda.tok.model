year readiness disclosure background in the past  many computer software programs were written utilizing two digits rather than four in defining a year in the date field 
as a result  date sensitive computer software and embedded technology may recognize the year in the date field as the year rather than this inability of computer hardware  software  and other technology to distinguish between the year and is generally referred to as the year issue 
if this situation occurs  the potential exists for computer systems and equipment failures or erroneous calculations by computer programs and embedded technology in the year approach the company has established a year oversight committee comprised of certain senior officers and internal audit personnel to develop a comprehensive approach with regard to the company s assessment and mitigation of the year issue 
to date  this approach has included the establishment of a year task force comprised principally of various information technology personnel under the direction of the company s information technology vice president 
the task force has been meeting on a regularly scheduled basis to assess the company s readiness with regard to the year issue 
the task force has divided the year project into three main sections it systems  which encompasses the company s hardware and software operating and application  non it systems  which encompasses embedded technology and microprocessors contained in telecommunications and facilities management systems and other equipment  and third parties  which encompasses the company s major vendors  suppliers and customers 
the general phases to the task force s approach are phase inventorying year items  phase prioritizing identified items  phase assessing the year compliance of the items determined to be material to the company  phase creating a project plan to address material items that are determined not to be year compliant  phase executing the project plan  which includes repairing  replacing or upgrading of such items  phase testing the material items 
status with respect to the it systems and non it systems sections  phases have been completed and phase is currently in process 
the company expects to have substantially all it systems and non it systems year issues mitigated by march  with respect to the third parties section  the company has identified and prioritized its critical vendors  suppliers and customers and communicated with them about their plans in addressing the year problem 
evaluations of certain of the most critical vendors are in process and the third party section is expected to be completed by june  costs the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
the estimated total cost to the company of the year project is approximately  the total amount expended on the project through december  was approximately  which related primarily to the it systems and non it systems section 
this amount came from the company s operating funds 
the estimated cost of the company s year efforts and the dates on which the company believes it will complete the various phases referred to above are based on management s best estimates using various assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans and other matters 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such differences include the availability and costs of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to identify  assess  remediate  and test all relevant computer codes and embedded technology  the risk that reasonable testing will not uncover all year problems and similar uncertainties 
risk factors the company utilizes computer systems in virtually all aspects of its business 
the company also maintains relationships with a number of vendors  suppliers  and customers whose own state of readiness with regard to the year issue could potentially impact the company 
these parties include software  hardware  and telecommunication providers  banks and investment brokers  reinsurers and reinsurance intermediaries  certain agents  and utilities 
the failure to correct a material year issue by the company or a material third party could materially and adversely impact the company s statement of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the year issue  the company is unable to determine whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s statement of operations  liquidity  or financial position 
however  the company believes with its completion of its year project significant interruptions of operations should be reduced 
additionally  the company issues professional liability  including directors officers liability  and commercial multi peril insurance policies 
coverage under certain of these policies may cover losses suffered by insureds as a result of year issues 
the company s professional liability policies are written on a claims made and reported basis  and since early approximately of such policies have included a year exclusion endorsement 
the company is including a year exclusion endorsement on virtually all new or renewing professional liability policies providing coverage effective january  and thereafter 
on occasion  for qualifying accounts  underwriters may remove the exclusion after satisfactory receipt and review of a supplemental application which includes a warranty statement and other underwriting information 
with respect to its commercial multi peril policies the company believes claims against the comprehensive general liability coverage under these policies should fail based upon the doctrine of fortuity 
however  it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent coverage could ultimately be found to exist by the courts and the effect thereof on the company 
additionally  the company could incur expense to contest the assertion of year coverage claims  even if the company prevails in its position 
as a result  it is impossible to predict what  if any  exposure insurance companies may ultimately have for year claims whether coverage for the issue is specifically excluded or included 
contingency plans the company has not established contingency plans for non compliance of its it systems or non it systems since the company anticipates that the it systems and non it systems sections will be year compliant by march  the company s review of the third parties section will be completed by june  presently  the company is not aware of any major third party problem 
the company is on schedule with its expected completion dates for all sections 
to the extent that the company is aware of a non compliant material third party a contingency plan would be developed which would potentially include replacing non compliant material third party vendors and suppliers 
inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss adjusted expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts  is known 
the company attempts to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing its premiums and reserves 
substantial future increases in inflation could result in future increases in interest rates  which  in turn  are likely to result in a decline in the market value of the company s investment portfolio and resulting unrealized losses and or reductions in shareholders equity
