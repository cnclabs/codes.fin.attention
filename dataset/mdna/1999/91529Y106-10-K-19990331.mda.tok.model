introduction the company acquired genex services  inc genex and the paul revere corporation paul revere on february   and march   respectively 
the financial information contained herein includes the accounts and operating results of genex and paul revere from the respective dates of acquisition 
since genex and paul revere are reflected in the results for and  and not  the difference in comparability of the years is frequently attributed to that fact 
results for affinity groups  previously reported as a separate line of business in the employee benefits segment  have been allocated by product type to various other lines of business in the employee benefits and other segments 
results for voluntary benefits  previously included in the employee benefits segment  are now reported as a separate segment 
results for corporate  previously included in the other segment  are now reported as a separate segment 
management believes that the trends in new annualized sales in the individual and employee benefits segments are important for investors to assess in their analysis of the company s results of operations 
the trends in new sales are indicators of the level of market acceptance of new products  particularly in the individual disability income line of business  and the company s potential for growth in its respective markets 
the company has closely linked its various incentive compensation plans for management and employees to the achievement of its goals for new sales 
the following discussion of operating results by segment excludes net realized investment gains and losses from revenue and income before taxes 
the company s investment focus has been on investment income to support its insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains 
due to the nature of the company s business  a long term focus in necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business 
the realization of investment gains and losses will impact future earnings levels as the underlying business is long term in nature and requires that the company be able to sustain the assumed interest rates in its liabilities 
however  income excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income as a measure of the company s profitability  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
operating results revenue excluding net realized investment gains and losses revenue increased million  or percent to  million in from  million in revenue includes premium income  net investment income  and other income 
this increase resulted from increased revenue in the individual segment million  employee benefits segment million  voluntary benefits segment million  and corporate segment million 
this increase was partly offset by lower revenue in the other segment million 
in  revenue increased  million  or percent  to  million from  million in this increase resulted from increased revenue in the individual segment million  employee benefits segment million  voluntary benefits segment million  and other segment million

revenue in the individual segment increased million  or percent  to  million in from  million in the increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of paul revere 
premium income in this segment increased million  or percent  to  million in from  million in both the individual disability income and individual life lines of business produced increases in premium income 
also in this segment  net investment income increased million  or percent  to million in from million in  primarily due to the acquisition of paul revere and increased capital allocation 
management expects that premium income in the individual segment will begin to grow on a year over year basis as the product transition in the individual disability income line of business begins to produce increasing levels of new sales of individual disability products 
in  revenue in the individual segment increased million  or percent  to  million from  million in the increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of paul revere  which contributed million of revenue to this segment in premium income in this segment increased million  or percent  to  million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of paul revere  which contributed million of premium income to this segment in within this segment  revenue in the individual disability income line of business increased million  or percent  to  million in from million in revenue in the individual life line of business increased million  or percent  to million in from million in both of these lines of business benefited from the paul revere acquisition 
in november  the company announced its intention to discontinue the sale of individual disability products which combined lifetime benefits and short elimination periods with own occupation provisions other than conversion policies available under existing contractual arrangements 
at the same time the company began introducing products that insured loss of earnings as opposed to occupations  and these products generally contained more limited benefit periods and longer elimination periods 
since the acquisition of paul revere in march  the company has discontinued the sale of certain paul revere products that are not consistent with the company s strategic direction for its product portfolio 
the company expects to continue to offer selected paul revere products with own occupation while not working features applying stricter underwriting standards 
the company has filed new rates for some of these products and is in the process of repricing other of these selected products and making modifications to their features where appropriate 
going forward  the company expects to offer a limited portfolio of own occupation based coverages along with its more complete line of loss of earnings related disability coverages 
in the fourth quarter of  new annualized sales in the individual disability income line totaled million  compared to million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of  reflecting the continued product transition 
on a pro forma basis  sales of individual disability income contracts declined in to million from million in  reflecting the planned discontinuance of certain products and restructuring of others and  secondarily  with the consolidation of the company s and paul revere s sales offices and related realignment of the field sales force 
revenue is not expected to be significantly impacted by the transition in products due to continued favorable persistency 
the magnitude and duration of the decline in sales from previous years  such as that experienced during and  are dependent on the response of customers and competitors in the industry 
income in the individual segment increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the increase in this segment was primarily the result of increased income in the individual life line of business to million in from million in due to the acquisition of paul revere and higher net investment income 
income in the individual disability income line of business declined million  or percent  to million in from million in this decline is primarily due to an million increase in the individual disability reserves for existing claims related to the expected increase in claims duration due to management s expectation that productivity in the claims organization will be impacted as a result of planning  consolidation  and integration efforts related to the company s merger with unum corporation unum 
the impact on productivity is expected to lengthen the average claims duration for a relatively short period of time until the new claims organization completes its transition process following the merger 
in  income in the individual segment increased million  or percent  to million from million in this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of paul revere and improved results in the company s individual disability income line of business 
in this line  income increased million  or percent  to million in from million in this improvement is primarily due to the acquisition of paul revere and a higher level of net claim resolutions 
management believes the substantial investment in the individual disability claims management process since the first quarter of helped produce the improvement that occurred in this line 
the major elements of this investment include an emphasis on early intervention to better respond to the specific nature of the claims  increased specialization to properly adjudicate the increasingly specialized nature of disability claims  and an increased level of staffing with experienced claim adjusters 
the individual life line of business produced income of million in  an increase of million  or percent  over the million in the increase is the result of the acquisition of paul revere

the closed blocks of business have been segregated for reporting and monitoring purposes

this reinsured block constitutes substantially all of the company s medical stop loss insurance business 
the small portion remaining consists of medical stop loss coverages sold to clients other than those of cigna 
these coverages will not be renewed 
the medical stop loss business produced revenue of million  million  and million and income of million  million  and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
on april   the company closed the sale of its in force individual and tax sheltered annuity business to american general annuity insurance company and the variable annuity life insurance company  affiliates of american general corporation american general 
the sale was effected by reinsurance in the form of coinsurance agreements whereby the financial liability for the various annuity lines was transferred to american general 
the responsibility for providing administrative services was also assumed by american general pursuant to various administrative services agreements with the american general affiliates 
the in force business sold consisted primarily of individual fixed annuities and tax sheltered annuities in provident life and accident insurance company accident  provident national assurance company national  the paul revere life insurance company paul revere life  the paul revere variable annuity insurance company paul revere variable and the paul revere protective life insurance company paul revere protective

in consideration for the transfer of the approximately billion of statutory reserves  american general paid the company a ceding commission of approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in  the company transferred its dental business to ameritas life insurance corp 
the dental block  which was acquired in the paul revere acquisition  produced million in premium income in and million in revenue in the other segment declined million  or percent  to million in from million in the decline in revenue in this segment is primarily due to lower net investment income  which declined million  or percent  to million in from million in this decline is primarily the result of a decrease in gic funds under management from  million as of december   to million as of december   resulting from the strategic decision to discontinue the sale of gics 
also in this segment  premium income declined million  or percent  to million in from million in this decline is primarily due to the transfer of the dental block in in  revenue in the other segment increased million  or percent  to million from million in this increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of paul revere  which added million of revenue in  including million of revenue in the individual annuity line of business 
this increase was partly offset by a decline in funds under management resulting from the discontinuation of the sale of products in the group pension line of business 
revenue in this line of business declined million to million in from million in revenue in the corporate owned life insurance line of business increased by million  or percent  to million in from million in  primarily due to increased net investment income 
income in the other segment declined million  or percent  to million in from million in the decline in this segment was due in part to the sale of the individual annuity line and the reinsurance of the medical stop loss line 
income in the group pension line of business also declined to million in from million in primarily due to the result of lower funds under management and lower income from a reduced amount of capital allocated to this line 
in addition  the company recorded an million reserve strengthening for group spas during this decline was partly offset by improved income in the coli line of business which increased to million in from million in in  income in the other segment increased million  or percent  to million from million in this increase was primarily the result of higher income in the individual annuities line of business  which increased to million in from million in  due to the acquisition of paul revere 
this increase was partly offset by lower income in the group pension line of business  which produced income of million in  a decline of million  or percent  from million in the medical stop loss line also produced lower income in  declining million  or percent  to million in from million in the other segment contains lines of business that are no longer actively marketed by the company and are in run off mode 
it is expected that revenue and earnings in this segment will decline over time as these business lines wind down 
the run off of the group pension line results in a decline in assets under management and  in turn  a continued decline in the net investment income produced by the assets 
management expects to reinvest the capital supporting these lines of business in the future growth of the individual and employee benefits segments 
corporate segment operating results the corporate segment includes investment earnings on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business  corporate interest expense  amortization of goodwill  and certain corporate expenses not allocated to a line of business 
revenue in the corporate segment increased million  or percent  to million in from million in this increase is primarily the result of higher net investment income from unallocated capital and surplus 
in  revenue in the corporate segment declined million  or percent  to million from million in this decline is primarily the result of a lower level of net investment income from unallocated capital and surplus 
the corporate segment reported a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in interest and debt expense increased to million in from million in also  amortization of goodwill increased to million in from million in  reflecting the acquisitions of paul revere and genex 
in  the corporate segment reported a loss of million compared to a loss of million in interest and debt expense increased to million in from million in also  amortization of goodwill increased to million in as a result of the acquisition of paul revere and genex 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company consummated the acquisition of paul revere  which was financed through common equity issuance to zurich insurance company  a swiss insurer  and its affiliates  common equity issuance and cash to paul revere stockholders  debt  and internally generated funds 
the debt financing was provided through an million revolving bank credit facility with various domestic and international banks 
the revolving bank credit facility was established in to provide partial financing for the purchase of paul revere and genex  to refinance the existing bank term notes of million  and for general corporate uses 
at december   outstanding borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility were million 
the revolving bank credit facility was repaid on february  the company also redeemed its outstanding cumulative preferred stock  which had an aggregate value of million  on february  the debt repayment and preferred stock redemption were funded through short term borrowing 
on march   the company completed a public offering of million of senior notes due march  on march   provident financing trust i  a wholly owned subsidiary trust of the company  issued million of capital securities in a public offering 
these capital securities  which mature on march   are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company  have a liquidation value of  per capital security  and have a mandatory redemption feature under certain circumstances 
the company issued million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures  which mature on march   to the subsidiary trust in connection with the capital securities offering 
the sole assets of the subsidiary trust are the junior subordinated debt securities 
in april  the company entered into a million five year revolving credit facility and a million day revolving credit facility with various domestic and international banks 
the purpose of the facilities is for general corporate purposes 
there are no outstanding borrowings under either of the credit facilities 
in july  the company completed a public offering of million of senior notes due july   and million of senior notes due july  the proceeds from these offerings funded the repayment of the short term borrowing used for the february debt repayment and preferred stock redemption 
the company believes the cash flow from its operations will be sufficient to meet its operating and financial cash flow requirements 
periodically  the company may issue debt or equity securities to fund internal expansion  acquisitions  investment opportunities  and the retirement of the company s debt and equity 
as a holding company  the company is dependent upon payments from its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries and genex to pay dividends to its stockholders and to pay its expenses 
these payments by the company s subsidiaries may take the form of either dividends or interest payments on amounts loaned to such subsidiaries by the company or expense reimbursement 
at december   the company had outstanding from its insurance subsidiaries a million surplus debenture due in with a weighted average interest rate during of and a million surplus debenture due in with a weighted average interest rate during of 
semi annual interest payments are conditional upon the approval by the insurance department of the state of domicile 
state insurance laws generally restrict the ability of insurance companies to pay cash dividends or make other payments to their affiliates in excess of certain prescribed limitations 
in the company s insurance subsidiaries states of domicile  regulatory approval is required if an insurance company seeks to make loans to affiliates in amounts equal to or in excess of three percent of the insurer s admitted assets or to pay cash dividends in any twelve month period in excess of the greater of such company s net gain from operations of the preceding year or ten percent of its surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding year end  each as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities 
the company anticipates that million will be available in for such purposes without regulatory approval 
the company s liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flow provided from operations  principally in its insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash 
cash flow from operations was sufficient in cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions and operating expenses as well as purchases of new investments 
the company has established an investment strategy that management believes will provide for adequate cash flow from operations 
as a result of the release of capital generated by the run off of the gic portfolio  the sale of the commercial mortgage loans and other corporate actions  the company has increased its available capital to support the growth of its businesses  including assisting in the financing of the acquisitions of paul revere and genex 
management continues to analyze potential opportunities to utilize the capital to further enhance stockholder value  including exploring options that would support the company s growth initiatives 
in november  the company announced its plans to merge with unum  a leading provider of disability products and other employee benefits  in a transaction that will create unumprovident corporation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
market risks the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating the company s overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
the company employs various derivative programs to manage these material market risks 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk the operations of the company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  primarily long term us interest rates 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
management continually models and tests asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to the company s activities in derivative financial instruments 
the company uses interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  exchange traded interest rate futures contracts  and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from the december  levels  the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments is estimated to be million at december  additionally  the fair value of those assets currently reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition at their amortized cost or unpaid balances  namely held to maturity securities and policy loans  would decrease by million and million  respectively 
assuming a basis point decrease in long term interest rates from the december  level  the fair value of the company s long term debt and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities would increase approximately million and million  respectively 
the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices is determined using a matrix pricing system whereby all securities are priced with the resulting market rates and spreads assuming a change of basis points 
these hypothetical prices are compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in fair value of long term debt and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities are determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because the company actively manages its investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 
foreign currency risk the company is subject to foreign exchange risk arising from its canadian operations and certain canadian dollar denominated investment securities 
assuming a foreign exchange rate decrease of from the december  level  the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity is estimated to be million at december  at december   there were no outstanding derivatives hedging the foreign currency risk 
investments investment activities are an integral part of the company s business  and profitability is significantly affected by investment results 
invested assets are segmented into portfolios  which support the various product lines 
generally  the investment strategy for the portfolios is to match the effective asset durations with related expected liability durations and to maximize investment returns  subject to constraints of quality  liquidity  diversification  and regulatory considerations 
the following table provides the distribution of invested assets for the years indicated 
december investment grade fixed maturity securities below investment grade fixed maturity securities equity securities mortgage loans real estate policy loans other total the following table provides certain investment information and results for the years indicated 
year ended december in millions of dollars average cash and invested assets    net investment income    average yield net realized investment gains losses average yield is determined by dividing annualized net investment income by the average cash and invested assets for the year 
excluding net unrealized gains on securities  the yield is   and for   and  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the past three years  the company s exposure to non current investments has improved significantly from prior years 
these non current investments are primarily foreclosed real estate and mortgage loans which became more than thirty days past due in their principal and interest payments 
non current investments totaled million at december   or percent of invested assets 
the company s investment in mortgage backed securities approximates billion on an amortized cost basis at december  and billion at december  at december   the mortgage backed securities had an average life of years and effective duration of years 
the mortgage backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities 
the primary risk involved in investing in mortgage backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal 
the company uses models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
the company has not invested in mortgage backed derivatives  such as interest only  principal only or residuals  where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates 
below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid 
management does not anticipate any liquidity problem caused by the investments in below investment grade securities  nor does it expect these investments to adversely affect its ability to hold its other investments to maturity 
the company s exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities at december   was  million  representing percent of invested assets  below the company s internal limit of percent of invested assets for this type of investment 
the company s exposure to below investment grade fixed maturities totaled  million at december   representing percent of invested assets 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
management regularly models and tests all asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to prepare for the most disadvantageous outcomes 
the company utilizes forward interest rate swaps  forward treasury purchases  and options on forward interest rate swaps to manage and increase yield on cash flows expected from current holdings 
all transactions are hedging in nature and not speculative 
almost all transactions are associated with the individual disability product portfolio 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
year issues as are many other businesses in this country and abroad  the company is affected in numerous ways  both by its own computer information systems and by third parties with which it has business relationships  in the processing of date data relating to the year and beyond 
failure to adequately address and substantially resolve year issues could  and as to mission critical systems in certain circumstances would  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
while there can be no assurance as to its success  the company has a project underway which is intended and designed to avoid and or mitigate any such material adverse effect from year issues 
in the company completed the significant aspects of the planning phase of a project designed to modify its computer information systems to enable proper processing of date data relating to the year this project has a number of phases  including i planning  ii inventory ascertaining the various internal systems and external relationships potentially affected by year issues  iii analysis determining the extent to which the system or remediation or conversion to a compliant alternative  iv construction remediating the system in order to be compliant  v testing subjecting the integrated testing to validate interconnected and future date processing in the date forward year environment  and vi completion 
the company defines year compliant or compliance to mean that software will have the ability to i accept input and provide output of data involving dates or portions of dates correctly and without ambiguity as to the twentieth or twenty first centuries  ii manage  store  manipulate  sort  sequence  and perform calculations with respect to data involving dates or portions of dates before  during and after january  including single century or multi century date formulas without malfunction  abends  aborts  and iii manage the leap year occurring in the year and any special dates 
the term special dates means dates used by programmers to create exceptions where no date could be determined as specified to serve as end of file indicators or to facilitate sort routines 
the company s approach has primarily been one of modifying or remediating systems to make them compliant since there are not generally compliant replacements available in the market that will meet the company s operational needs 
in some instances non compliant systems have been replaced with available and usable compliant systems where that approach is both cost and time effective 
in addition  there are different areas of remediation requiring different solutions 
these include the following i business applications systems supporting core business processes  this area constitutes more than percent of the overall project effort  ii user developed systems non mission critical systems developed by business areas in the company for specific tasks  iii hardware and software computers  central operating systems  software development  and non information technology systems  this area requires contacting vendors as to year compliance  iv enterprise computing compliance of the computing infrastructure and year test facilities  and v business partners other external business relationships that have year compliance issues  this area requires contacting third parties as to the status of year compliance 
operational control of the project is the responsibility of the project office 
the following table provides information as to the timeline of phases of completion of the year project for different areas of the company s business year project time line q q q q q business impact initial development pilot applications analysis project plan of applications completed developed methodology chosen to validate methodology project office corporate awareness activities begin q q q q business detail risk regression testing applications project plan assessments begins developed performed  inventory completed user inventory risk assessments developed begins completed systems hardware and vendor vendor inventory of hardware software surveys management and software begins initiated program formalized enterprise future date upgrade of definition analysis work computing time machine infrastructure plan development environment products construction of in house planning begins system applications begins business awareness partners campaign extends to responses to external inquiries project documentation project office formalized executive and office and audit formed board reporting process defined year project time line continued q q q q business construction full compliance of applications completed  business business applications applications begin time machine testing user systems in full compliance of developed construction user developed systems and testing systems hardware and inventory of standard software field office software third party configuration service established providers enterprise time machine certification full compliance computing environment testing of of home office constructed computing infrastructure  at sites infrastructure network and completed telephony systems business request for contingency contingency business partner partners information planning plans finalized interface testing sent to process for all electronic defined for critical business critical business partners business interfaces processes project testing business impact office metrics teams formulated established for time machine q q q q hardware and contingency plans software implemented as required enterprise upgrade and computing replacement of all pc systems completed business business contingency plans partners partner implemented as interface required testing completed project enterprise rollover enterprise rollover plan office wide plan wide executed  business integration developed  integration and information testing for including testing for re systems response re response team certification teams in place certification requirements completed begins with regard to genex  a separate operating subsidiary acquired in february  the primary approach to attaining year compliance will be replacing non compliant systems with compliant systems 
this process is expected to be complete in the third quarter of with the exception of genex  as of december   the company has completed the compliance testing of its material business systems 
compliance testing was conducted in an isolated  date forward environment using the company s standard of compliance see above 
in march  the company will begin periodically testing its systems in this date forward environment to ensure continued compliance into the next century  as well as scheduling testing of external electronic interfaces with its business partners 
there are numerous instances in which third parties having a relationship with the company have year issues to address and resolve 
these include primarily vendors of hardware and software  holders of group insurance policies  issuers of investment securities  financial institutions  governmental agencies  and suppliers 
an aspect of the project has been to identify these third parties and generally to contact them seeking written assurance as to the third party s expectancy to be year compliant 
written requests have been sent to more than third parties 
the nature of the company s follow up depends upon its assessment of the response and of the materiality of the effect of non compliance by the third party on the company 
for example  the company follows up with additional written requests and telephonic inquiries depending upon the circumstances and in some instances determines that it is appropriate to test third party systems about which it has received written assurance 
project personnel have identified primary business areas which  based on the status of current responses from third parties and their risk assessments  have the potential for year problems 
in instances in which the effect of non compliance may be deemed materially adverse to the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition  the project personnel have determined alternatives for contingent arrangements  and project personnel are considering appropriate documentation of potential procedural changes by the company or third party providers 
at this time these include various plans for investments and cash management  underwriting  client services  workplace management  and claims 
with regard to material relationships  contingency plans are expected to be ready for execution by the end of second quarter  since inception of the project  the company has expensed million through december   in connection with incremental cost of the year project and estimates an additional million to complete the project 
the effort of the information systems personnel and others devoted to the project has been considerable 
temporary personnel in varying numbers have been retained to assist full time personnel in some phases or aspects of the project 
the company has utilized compensation programs to retain project personnel in order to keep the project on schedule 
while the project has required systems management to more closely scrutinize the prioritization of information technology projects  it is not believed that any deferral of information technology projects has had a material impact on the company 
at various stages during the project  the company has used consultants on some particular aspects of the project 
the company has also had occasional contact with certain peer companies comparing approaches to year issues 
the company has not sought and does not currently expect to obtain independent verification of its processes for dealing with year given the range of possibilities that may occur in connection with non compliance with year that could affect the company  particularly as a consequence of third parties  the company is unable to provide an estimate of the impact of such non compliance on its business  results of operations  or financial condition 
with regard to non compliance resulting from the company s systems  which the company believes to be less likely than that resulting from third parties  the company would devote its financial and personnel resources  which include approximately systems personnel who would be available  to remediate the problem as soon as possible 
with regard to non compliance resulting from third party failure  the company is trying to determine through responses and other appropriate action where there is any material likelihood of non compliance having a potentially material impact 
in these instances it is seeking to develop an appropriate contingency arrangement that will minimize such impact  however  given the range of possibilities  no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
the foregoing discussion of the year issue contains forward looking statements relating to such matters as financial performance and the business of the company 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order for the company to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience relating to compliance with year to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements concerning year issues  which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
these factors include i the unanticipated material impact of a system fault of the company relating to year  ii the failure to successfully remediate  in spite of testing  material systems of the company  iii the time it may take to successfully remediate a failure once it occurs  as well as the resulting costs and loss of revenues  and iv the failure of third parties to properly remediate material year problems
