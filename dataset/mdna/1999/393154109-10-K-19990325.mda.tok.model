our wholesale rate on sales to two wholesale customers is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
revenues from sales to these customers were approximately of operating revenues for late in  we began serving a municipal utility  northfield electric department  under our wholesale tariff 
this customer increased our electricity sales in by approximately  mwh and peak requirements by approximately mw 
revenues in from northfield were  we provide transmission service to twelve customers within the state under rates regulated by the ferc  revenues for such services amounted to less than of the company s operating revenues for on april   the ferc issued orders and that among other things required the filing of open access transmission tariffs by electric utilities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations transmission issues federal open access tariff orders 
nepool s open access tariff for certain transmission facilities  including certain facilities between new york and new england  incorporates a load based method of capacity allocation for nepool transmission facilities 
the open access tariff could reduce the amount of capacity available to the company from such facilities in the future

department of public service twenty year electric plan 
in december  the department adopted an update of its twenty year electrical power supply plan the plan for the state 
the plan includes an overview of statewide growth and development as they relate to future requirements for electrical energy  an assessment of available energy resources  and estimates of future electrical energy demand 
in june  we filed with the vpsb and the department an integrated resource plan pursuant to vermont statute vsa section c 
that filing is still pending before the vpsb 
recent rate developments on may   we filed a request with the vpsb to increase retail rates by percent 
the retail rate increase is needed to cover higher power supply costs  the cost of the january ice storm  higher taxes and investments in new plant and equipment 
on november   by memorandum of understanding mou  the company  the department and ibm agreed to implementation of a temporary rate increase of percent  effective december   with the potential for an additional surcharge in order to produce additional revenues necessary to provide the company with the capacity to finance estimated pine street barge canal site expenditures of million  and to stay  effective november   further rate proceedings in this rate case until or after september   or such earlier date to which the parties may later agree or the vpsb may order

competition and restructuring electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
legislative authority has existed since that would permit vermont cities  towns and villages to own and operate public utilities 
since that time  no municipality served by the company has established or  as far as is known to the company  is presently taking steps to establish a municipal public utility 
in  the vermont general assembly enacted legislation that authorized the department to sell electricity on a significantly expanded basis 
before the new law was passed  the department s authority to make retail sales had been limited 
it could sell at retail only to residential and farm customers and could sell only power that it had purchased from the niagara and st 
lawrence projects operated by the new york power authority 
under the law  the department can sell electricity purchased from any source at retail to all customer classes throughout the state  but only if it convinces the vpsb and other state officials that the public good will be served by such sales 
the department has made limited additional retail sales of electricity 
the department retains its traditional responsibilities of public advocacy before the vpsb and electricity planning on a statewide basis 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and among states across the country  including vermont  are considering how to restructure the electric utility industry to facilitate competition for electricity sales at wholesale and retail levels

vermont yankee 
the company and central vermont public service corporation acted as lead sponsors in the construction of the vermont yankee nuclear plant  a boiling water reactor designed by general electric company 
the plant  which became operational in  has a generating capacity of mw 
vermont yankee has entered into power contracts with its sponsor utilities  including the company  that expire at the end of the life of the unit 
pursuant to our power contract  we are required to pay of vermont yankee s operating expenses including depreciation and taxes  fuel costs including charges in respect of estimated costs of disposal of spent nuclear fuel  decommissioning expenses  interest expense and return on common equity  whether or not the vermont yankee plant is operating 
in  we sold to other vermont utilities a share of our entitlement to the output of vermont yankee 
accordingly  those utilities have an aggregate obligation to the company to pay of vermont yankee s operating expenses  fuel costs  decommissioning expenses  interest expense and return on common equity 
as a result of the bankruptcy of one of those utilities  a portion of the entitlement has reverted back to us 
accordingly  those utilities have an obligation to pay us of vermont yankee s operating expenses  fuel costs  decommissioning expenses  interest expense and return on common equity  whether or not the vermont yankee plant is operating 
vermont yankee has also entered into capital funds agreements with its sponsor utilities that expire on december  under our capital funds agreement  we are required  subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  to provide of the capital requirements of vermont yankee not obtained from outside sources 
on april   vermont yankee applied to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for an amendment to its operating license to extend the expiration date from december to march  in order to take advantage of current nrc policy to issue operating licenses for a year term measured from the grant of the operating license 
prior nrc policy  under which the operating license was issued  called for a term of years from the date of the construction permit 
on august   the state  opposing the license extension  filed a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene  which petition was subsequently granted 
on december   the nrc issued an amendment to the operating license extending the expiration date to march   based upon a no significant hazards finding by the nrc staff and subject to the outcome of the evidentiary hearing on the state s assertions 
on july   vermont yankee reached a settlement with the state  and the state filed a withdrawal of its intervention 
the proceeding was dismissed on september  the nrc s most recently issued systematic assessment of licensee performance scores for vermont yankee are for the period january  to july  operations  engineering  maintenance and plant support were rated good 
these scores were identical to vermont yankee s scores for the prior month period except for plant support  which declined from superior 
during periods when vermont yankee is unavailable  we incur replacement power costs in excess of those costs that we would have incurred for power purchased from vermont yankee 
replacement power is available to us from nepool and through contractual arrangements with other utilities 
replacement power costs adversely affect cash flow and  absent deferral  amortization and recovery through rates  would adversely affect reported earnings 
routinely  in the case of scheduled outages for refueling  the vpsb has permitted the company to defer  amortize and recover these excess replacement power costs for financial reporting and rate making purposes over the period until the next scheduled outage 
vermont yankee has adopted an month refueling schedule 
on march   vermont yankee began a scheduled refueling outage  which concluded june  the refueling outage is scheduled to begin october  in the case of unscheduled outages of significant duration resulting in substantial unanticipated costs for replacement power  the vpsb generally has authorized deferral  amortization and recovery of such costs 
vermont yankee s current estimate of decommissioning as approved by ferc is approximately million  of which million has been funded 
vermont yankee is in the process of preparing an updated site decommissioning cost study 
preliminary results indicate that the revised estimate could exceed million in dollars 
vermont yankee is required to file the results of the new study with the ferc by march   and expects that any resulting change in rates will be effective january  at december   our portion of the net non funded liability was million  which we expect will be recovered through rates over vermont yankee s remaining operating life 
during  we incurred million in vermont yankee annual capacity charges  which included million for interest charges 
our share of vermont yankee s long term debt at december  was million 
during the year ended december   we utilized  mwh of vermont yankee energy to meet of our retail and requirements wholesale rate w sales 
the average cost of vermont yankee electricity in was cents per kwh 
vermont yankee s annual capacity factor for was  compared to in and in the decrease in capacity was due to plant outages 
the price anderson act currently sets the statutory limit of liability from a single incident at a nuclear power plant at billion 
any damages beyond billion are indemnified under the price anderson act  but subject to congressional approval 
the first million of liability coverage is the maximum provided by private insurance 
the secondary financial protection program is a retrospective insurance plan providing additional coverage up to billion per incident by assessing each of the reactor units that are currently subject to the program in the united states a total of million  limited to a maximum assessment of million per incident per nuclear unit in any one year 
the maximum assessment is adjusted at least every five years to reflect inflationary changes 
the above insurance now covers all workers employed at nuclear facilities for bodily injury claims 
vermont yankee had previously purchased a master worker insurance policy with limits of million with one automatic reinstatement of policy limits to cover workers employed on or after january  vermont yankee no longer participates in this retrospectively based worker policy and has replaced this policy with the guaranteed cost coverage mentioned above 
however  vermont yankee does retain a potential obligation for retrospective adjustments due to past operations of several smaller facilities that did not join the new program 
these exposures will cease to exist no later than december  vermont yankee s maximum retrospective obligation remains at million 
the secondary financial protection layer  as referenced above  would be in excess of the master worker policy 
insurance has been purchased from nuclear electric insurance limited neil to cover the costs of property damage  decontamination or premature decommissioning resulting from a nuclear incident 
all companies insured with neil are subject to retroactive assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds available 
the maximum potential assessment against vermont yankee with respect to neil losses arising during the current policy year is million 
vermont yankee s liability for the retrospective premium adjustment for any policy year ceases six years after the end of that policy year unless prior demand has been made

hydro quebec highgate interconnection 
on september   the highgate transmission facilities  which were constructed to import energy from hydro quebec in canada  began commercial operation 
the transmission facilities at highgate include a mw ac to dc to ac converter terminal and seven miles of kv transmission line 
velco built and operates the converter facilities  which we own jointly with a number of other vermont utilities 
nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
velco and certain other nepool members have entered into agreements with hydro quebec providing for the construction in two phases of a direct interconnection between the electric systems in new england and the electric system of hydro quebec in canada 
the vermont participants in this project  which has a capacity of  mw  will derive about of the total power supply benefits associated with the nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
the company  in turn  receives about one third of the vermont share of those benefits 
the benefits of the interconnection include access to surplus hydroelectric energy from hydro quebec at competitive prices  energy banking  under which participating new england utilities will transmit relatively inexpensive energy to hydro quebec during off peak periods and will receive equal amounts of energy  after adjustment for transmission losses  from hydro quebec during peak periods when replacement costs are higher  and provision for emergency transfers and mutual backup to improve reliability for both the hydro quebec system and the new england systems 
phase i 
the first phase phase i of the nepool hydro quebec interconnection consists of transmission facilities having a capacity of mw that traverse a portion of eastern vermont and extend to a converter terminal located in comerford  new hampshire 
these facilities entered commercial operation on october  vetco was organized to construct  own and operate those portions of the transmission facilities located in vermont 
total construction costs incurred by vetco for phase i were  of that amount  velco provided  of equity capital to vetco through sales of velco preferred stock to the vermont participants in the project 
the company purchased  of velco preferred stock to finance the equity portion of phase i 
the remaining  of construction cost was financed by vetco s issuance of  of long term debt in the fourth quarter of and the balance of  was financed by short term debt 
under the phase i contracts  each new england participant  including the company  is required to pay monthly its proportionate share of vetco s total cost of service  including its capital costs 
each participant also pays a proportionate share of the total costs of service associated with those portions of the transmission facilities constructed in new hampshire by a subsidiary of new england electric system 
phase ii 
agreements executed in among the company  velco and other nepool members and hydro quebec provided for the construction of the second phase phase ii of the interconnection between the new england electric system and that of hydro quebec 
phase ii expands the phase i facilities from mw to  mw  and provides for transmission of hydro quebec power from the phase i terminal in northern new hampshire to sandy pond  massachusetts 
construction of phase ii commenced in and was completed in late the phase ii facilities commenced commercial operation november   initially at a rating of  mw  and increased to a transfer capability of  mw in july the hydro quebec nepool firm energy contract provides for the import of economical hydro quebec energy into new england 
the company is entitled to of the phase ii power supply benefits 
total construction costs for phase ii were approximately  the new england participants  including the company  have contracted to pay monthly their proportionate share of the total cost of constructing  owning and operating the phase ii facilities  including capital costs 
as a supporting participant  the company must make support payments under year agreements 
these support agreements meet the capital lease accounting requirements under sfas at december   the present value of the company s obligation was  the company s projected future minimum payments under the phase ii support agreements are  for each of the years and an aggregate of  for the years the phase ii portion of the project is owned by new england hydro transmission electric company  inc and new england hydro transmission corporation  subsidiaries of new england electric system  in which certain of the phase ii participating utilities  including the company  own equity interests 
the company owns approximately of the equity of the corporations owning the phase ii facilities 
during construction of the phase ii project  the company  as an equity sponsor  was required to provide equity capital 
at december   the capital structure of such corporations was common equity and long term debt

at times  we request that portions of our power deliveries from hydro quebec and other sources be routed through new york 
our ability to do so could be adversely affected by the proposed tariff that nepool has filed with the ferc  which would reduce our allocation of capacity on transmission interfaces with new york 
as a result  our ability to import power to vermont from outside new england could be adversely affected  thereby impacting our power costs in the future

hydro quebec power supply contracts 
we have several purchase power contracts with hydro quebec 
the bulk of our purchases are comprised of two schedules  b and c  pursuant to a firm contract dated december under these two schedules  we purchase mw 
under an arrangement negotiated in january  the hq and the hq contracts  we received cash payments from hydro quebec of  in and  in in accordance with such arrangement  we agreed to shift certain transmission requirements  purchase certain quantities of power and make certain minimum payments for periods in which power is not purchased 
in addition  in november  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with hydro quebec under which hydro quebec paid  to the company in exchange for certain power purchase elections

stony brook i 
the massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company mmwec is principal owner and operator of stony brook  a mw combined cycle intermediate generating station located in ludlow  massachusetts  which commenced commercial operation in november we entered into a joint ownership agreement with mmwec dated as of october   whereby we acquired an ownership share of the plant  entitling us to mw of capacity 
in addition to this entitlement  we have contracted for mw of capacity for the life of the stony brook i plant  for which we will pay a proportionate share of mmwec s share of the plant s fixed costs and variable operating expenses 
the three units that comprise stony brook i are all capable of burning oil 
two of the units are also capable of burning natural gas 
the natural gas system at the plant was modified in to allow two units to operate simultaneously on natural gas

independent power producers 
the vpsb has adopted rules that implement for vermont the purchase requirements established by federal law in the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
under the rules  qualifying facilities have the option to sell their output to a central state purchasing agent under a variety of long and short term  firm and non firm pricing schedules 
each of these schedules is based upon the projected vermont composite system s power costs that would be required but for the purchases from independent producers 
the state purchasing agent assigns the energy so purchased  and the costs of purchase  to each vermont retail electric utility based upon its pro rata share of total vermont retail energy sales 
utilities may also contract directly with producers 
the rules provide that all reasonable costs incurred by a utility under the rules will be included in the utilities revenue requirements for rate making purposes 
currently  the state purchasing agent  vermont electric power producers  inc veppi  is authorized to seek mw of power from qualifying facilities under purpa  of which our average pro rata share in was approximately or mw 
the rated capacity of the qualifying facilities currently selling power to veppi is approximately mw 
these facilities were all online by the spring of  and no other projects are under development 
we do not expect any new projects to come online in the foreseeable future because the excess capacity in the region has eliminated the need for and value of additional qualifying facilities 
in  through both our direct contracts and veppi  we purchased  mwh of qualifying facilities production to meet of our retail and requirements wholesale sales at an average cost of cents per kwh 
short term opportunity purchases and sales 
we have arrangements with numerous utilities and power marketers actively trading power in new england and new york under which we may make purchases or sales of power on short notice and generally for brief periods of time when it appears economic to do so 
opportunity purchases are arranged when it is possible to purchase power for less than it would cost us to generate the power with our own sources 
purchases also help us save on replacement power costs during an outage of one of our base load sources 
opportunity sales are arranged when we have surplus energy available at a price that is economic to other regional utilities at any given time 
the sales are arranged based on forecasted costs of supplying the incremental power necessary to serve the sale 
prices are set so as to recover all of the forecasted fuel or production costs and to recover some  if not all  associated capacity costs 
during  we purchased  mwh  meeting of our retail and requirements wholesale sales  at an average cost of cents per kwh 
nepool 
as a participant of nepool  through velco  we take advantage of pool operations with central economic dispatch of participants generating plants  pooling of transmission facilities and economy and emergency exchange of energy and capacity 
the nepool agreement also imposes obligations on us to maintain a generating capacity reserve as set by nepool  but which is lower than the reserve which would be required if we were not a nepool participant 
company hydroelectric power 
the company wholly owns and operates eight hydroelectric generating facilities located on river systems within its service area  the largest of which has a generating output of mw 
in  these plants provided mwh of low cost energy  meeting of our retail and requirements wholesale sales at an average cost of cents per kwh  based on total embedded costs

velco 
the company and six other vermont electric distribution utilities own velco 
since commencing operation in  velco has transmitted power for its owners in vermont  including power from nypa and other power contracted for by vermont utilities 
velco also purchases bulk power for resale at cost to its owners  and as a member of nepool  represents all vermont electric utilities in pool arrangements and transactions 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
long term power sales 
in  we entered into an agreement for the sale to united illuminating of mw of capacity produced by the stony brook i combined cycle plant and provided for our recovery of all costs associated with the capacity and energy sold 
the agreement commenced october  and expired october  fuel 
during  our retail and requirements wholesale sales were provided by the following fuel sources from hydro company owned  nypa  hydro quebec and from small power producers  from nuclear  from coal  from wood  from natural gas  from oil  from wind  and purchased on a short term basis from other utilities through nepool 
vermont yankee has several requirement based contracts for the four components uranium  conversion  enrichment and fabrication used to produce nuclear fuel 
these contracts are executed only if the need or requirement for fuel arises 
under these contracts  any disruption of operating activity would allow vermont yankee to cancel or postpone deliveries until actually required 
the contracts extend through various time periods and contain clauses to allow vermont yankee the option to extend the agreements 
negotiation of new contracts and renegotiations of existing contracts routinely occurs  the latter often focuses on one of the four components 
the price of the reload was approximately million 
the reload will also cost approximately million 
future reload costs will depend on market and contract prices on january   vermont yankee entered into an agreement with a former uranium supplier whereby the supplier could opt to terminate a production purchase agreement dated august  although there had been no transactions under the production purchase agreement for several years  vermont yankee maintained certain financial rights 
in consideration for the option to terminate the production purchase agreement and the subsequent exercise of the option  vermont yankee received  in  which was recorded as an offset to nuclear fuel expense 
the potential future payments over a ten year period range from zero to million 
no payments were received in under this agreement 
due to the uncertainty of this transaction  any benefits received will be recorded on a cash basis 
vermont yankee has a contract with the united states department of energy doe for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
under the terms of this contract  in exchange for the one time fee discussed below and a quarterly fee of mil per kwh of electricity generated and sold  the doe agrees to provide disposal services when a facility for spent nuclear fuel and other high level radioactive waste is available  which is required by contract to be prior to january  the actual date for these disposal services is expected to be delayed many years 
doe currently estimates that a permanent disposal facility will not begin operation before a doe temporary disposal site may be provided in a few years  but no decision has been made to proceed on providing a temporary disposal site at this time 
the doe contract obligates vermont yankee to pay a one time fee of approximately million for disposal costs for all spent fuel discharged through april  although such amount has been collected in rates from the vermont yankee participants  vermont yankee has elected to defer payment of the fee to the doe as permitted by the doe contract 
the fee must be paid no later than the first delivery of spent nuclear fuel to the doe 
interest accrues on the unpaid obligation based on the thirteen week treasury bill rate and is compounded quarterly 
through  vermont yankee accumulated approximately million in an irrevocable trust to be used exclusively for defeasing this obligation at some future date  provided the doe complies with the terms of the aforementioned contract 
we do not maintain long term contracts for the supply of oil for our wholly owned oil fired peaking unit generating stations mw 
we did not experience difficulty in obtaining oil for our own units during  and  while no assurance can be given  we do not anticipate any such difficulty during none of the utilities from which we expect to purchase oil or gas fired capacity in has advised us of grounds for doubt about maintenance of secure sources of oil and gas during the year 
merrimack purchased coal under a long term contract from balley mine in western pennsylvania and occasionally on the spot market from northern west virginia and southern pennsylvania sources in our contract with merrimack expired may  wood for the mcneil plant is furnished to the burlington electric department from a variety of sources under short term contracts ranging from several weeks to six months duration 
the mcneil plant used  tons of wood chips and mill residue and million cubic feet of natural gas in the mcneil plant is forecasting consumption of wood chips for to be  tons and natural gas consumption of million cubic feet 
the stony brook combined cycle generating station is capable of burning either natural gas or oil in two of its turbines 
natural gas is supplied to the plant subject to its availability 
during periods of extremely cold weather  the supplier reserves the right to discontinue deliveries to the plant in order to satisfy the demand of its residential customers 
we assume  for planning and budgeting purposes  that the plant will be supplied with gas during the months of april through november  and that it will run solely on oil during the months of december through march 
the plant maintains an oil supply sufficient to meet approximately one half of its annual needs 
wind project 
our years of research and development work in wind generation was recognized in when we were selected by the doe and the electric power research institute epri to build a commercial scale wind powered facility 
the doe and epri provided partial funding for the wind project of approximately million 
the net cost to the company of the project  located in the southern vermont town of searsburg  was million 
the eleven wind turbines have a rating of mw and were commissioned july  in  the plant provided  mwh  meeting of our retail and requirements wholesale sales at an average cost of cents cents per kwh 
energy efficiency in  we continued to focus our energy efficiency services on programs that encouraged customers to install energy efficient equipment when they are planning to replace or buy new equipment rather than attempting to convince them to replace equipment that is still in good working order 
this strategy  along with careful management  has helped us to keep our cost per kilowatthour saved below cents which is a reduction in costs since in  our energy efficiency programs saved  megawatthours  above targeted savings for the year 
during the past eight years our efficiency programs have achieved a cumulative annual savings of  megawatthours  saving approximately million per year for our customers 
we continued to work with other vermont utilities and the vermont department of public service to improve and expand a set of statewide demand side management programs 
this effort should reduce cost of delivering these programs and provide a more standardized service to customers throughout the state 
in  we spent approximately million on energy efficiency programs  approximately of our retail revenue 
rate design the company seeks to design rates to encourage the shifting of electrical use from peak hours to off peak hours 
since  we have offered optional time of use rates for residential and commercial customers 
currently  approximately  of our residential customers continue to be billed on the original time of use rate basis 
in  we received regulatory approval for a rate design that permitted us to charge prices for electric service that reflected as accurately as possible the cost burden imposed by each customer class 
our rate design objectives are to provide a stable pricing structure and to accurately reflect the cost of providing electric services 
this rate structure helps to achieve these goals 
since inefficient use of electricity increases its cost  customers who are charged prices that reflect the cost of providing electrical service have real incentives to follow the most efficient usage patterns 
included in the vpsb s order approving this rate design was a requirement that our largest customers be charged time of use rates on a phased in basis by at year end december   approximately  of our largest customers  comprising of our retail revenues  continue to receive service on mandatory time of use rates 
in may  we filed our current rate design with the vpsb 
the parties  including the department  ibm and a low income advocacy group  entered into a settlement that was approved by the vpsb on december  under the settlement  the revenue allocation to each rate class was adjusted to reflect class by class cost changes since  the differential between the winter and summer rates was reduced  the customer charge was increased for most classes  and usage charges were adjusted to be closer to the associated marginal costs 
no modifications to base rate design have taken place since the vpsb order issued on december  dispatchable and interruptible service contracts in  we had interruptible dispatchable power contracts with three major ski areas  interruptible only contracts with five customers and dispatchable only contracts with an additional twenty four customers 
the interruptible portion of the contracts allows the company to control power supply capacity charges by reducing our capacity requirements 
during  we did not request any interruptions due to the surplus capacity in the region 
the dispatchable portion of the contracts allows customers to purchase electricity during times designated by the company when low cost power is available 
the customer s demand during these periods is not considered in calculating the monthly billing 
this program enables the company and the customers to benefit from load control 
we shift load from our high cost peak periods and the customer uses inexpensive power at a time when its use provides maximum value 
these programs are available by tariff for qualifying customers 
construction and capital requirements our capital expenditures for through and projection for are set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources construction

the current indicated annual dividend is per share of common stock 
our current dividend policy reflects changes affecting the electric utility industry  which is moving away from the traditional cost of service regulatory model to a competition based market for power supply  and the rate case developments discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations retail rate case 
the current environment prompted us to reassess the appropriateness of our dividend 
the company s board of directors will continue to assess and adjust the dividend when appropriate  as the vermont electric industry evolves towards competition

these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report 
earnings summary the company lost per average share of common stock in as compared with earnings per share of common stock of in and in the loss represents a negative return on average common equity of percent 
the earned return on average common equity was percent in and percent in the decrease in earnings in resulted primarily from the following a rate decision by the vermont public service board vpsb in february that disallowed recovery of million for hydro quebec power supply expenses and other costs  a million loss accrued in resulting from the continued disallowance of hydro quebec power costs during  higher power supply expenses resulting from a one time million payment received from hydro quebec in that reduced power supply expenses accordingly  a million charge associated with terminating the company s corporate headquarters lease and with workforce reductions in  and a million after tax loss experienced by mountain energy  inc in  as compared to earnings of  in  resulting from a million net write off of a wind power investment and continued start up operating losses incurred by micronair llc  a wholly owned wastewater treatment investment 
this loss was substantially off set by a million reduction in losses experienced by green mountain resources  inc gmri due to the absence of start up expenses in  as compared to the decrease in earnings was primarily due to diminished results by two of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
mountain energy  inc  the company s subsidiary that invests in energy generation  energy efficiency and wastewater treatment projects  earned million less in than in the decrease in earnings was primarily due to operating losses incurred by micronair  llc  a company in which mountain energy acquired a percent interest in  and a decline in rates paid for power generated by one of the california wind facilities in which it has invested 
gmri s loss in was million greater than the loss in due primarily to the development costs of its investment in green mountain energy resources llc gmer  the retail energy company in which the company sold a percent interest during the third quarter of future outlook competition and restructuring the electric utility business is experiencing rapid and substantial changes 
these changes are the result of the following trends surplus generating capacity  disparity in electric rates among and within various regions of the country  improvements in generation efficiency  increasing demand for customer choice  and new regulations and legislation intended to foster competition  also known as restructuring 
electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
as a result  competition for retail customers has been limited to competition with alternative fuel suppliers  primarily for heating and cooling  competition with customer owned generation  and direct competition among electric utilities to attract major new facilities to their service territories 
these competitive pressures have led the company and other utilities to offer  from time to time  special discounts or service packages to certain large customers 
in states across the country  including the new england states  there has been legislation enacted to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers  with incumbent utilities required to deliver that electricity over their transmission and distribution systems also known as retail wheeling 
increased competitive pressure in the electric utility industry may restrict the company s ability to charge energy prices high enough to recover embedded costs  such as the cost of purchased power obligations or of generation facilities owned by the company 
the amount by which such costs might exceed market prices is commonly referred to as stranded costs 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and in states  including vermont where legislation has not been enacted  are considering how to facilitate competition for electricity sales at the wholesale and retail levels 
the session of the vermont general assembly adjourned on april  without enacting legislation that would allow vermont customers to choose their electric supplier 
there is currently no indication that restructuring legislation will be enacted in the session 
in the future  the vermont general assembly through legislation  or the vpsb through a subsequent report  action or proceeding  may allow customers to choose their electric supplier 
if this happens without providing for recovery of a significant portion of the costs associated with our power supply contracts  the company s business  including our operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at the current level  would be adversely affected 
if actions by the vermont general assembly or the vpsb threaten the company s financial integrity  we will evaluate all potential alternatives available to us at that time  including  but not limited to  the filing of a petition for reorganization under the united states bankruptcy code 
in august  the vpsb hosted an open workshop to examine the extent to which realistic opportunities exist to increase the value or lower the costs of vermont s existing power supply arrangements  and  if such opportunities exist  to consider the best processes for attracting the highest value proposals 
topics included vermont s current power supply situation  case studies in reforming power supply  and opportunities in vermont to reform the power supply 
in september  the vpsb issued an order docket no 
opening an investigation into the reform of vermont s electric power supply and ordered all vermont electric utilities to participate 
that order also requested participants to file with the vpsb position papers to address the scope of the investigation and present substantive proposals for reform 
the company  together with central vermont public service corporation cvps  citizens utilities company and associated industries of vermont aiv  an industrial trade association  filed a position paper responding to the order 
we participated in the vpsb s technical conference in october at which the scope of the investigation was discussed 
we filed our response to that conference indicating the priorities and action steps we believe should be taken in order to provide the greatest assistance in the effort to mitigate vermont s power supply costs 
on july   governor howard b 
dean announced the appointment of the working group on vermont s electricity future working group to examine the structure of the utility industry in vermont 
the working group was comprised of five citizens who were charged with evaluating and devising sound public policy relating to the future of the vermont electric industry 
the working group issued its report on december  the fundamental conclusions of the report are bankruptcy is not a solution to vermont restructuring efforts and is not an appropriate means to resolve the above market costs associated with vermont s power supply portfolio 
financing mechanisms  including asset securitization  that have been implemented in other states that have restructured their electric industries should be made available in vermont 
such mechanisms would enable the utilities to provide an up front lump sum payment to suppliers of power to vermont utilities in exchange for terminating or substantially reducing the pricing in their contracts 
the legislature or regulators could authorize such financing mechanisms 
the utilities in vermont should exit the power generation and supply business as part of the restructuring of the electric industry in vermont 
the working group believes that vermont should move rapidly into a restructured competitive environment in which the incumbent utilities would serve as distribution providers 
as a component of a restructuring plan  serious consideration should be given to consolidation of the utilities in vermont  beginning with the amalgamation of citizens utilities vermont operations with green mountain power corporation and central vermont public service corporation 
on january   the company  cvps  aiv and citizen utilities filed consolidated comments and procedural recommendations with the vpsb regarding the working group s report 
we have recommended to the vpsb that it give priority to considering the working group s principal recommendations  as discussed above  and approve the procedures necessary for their implementation 
the idea of consolidation of vermont s utilities needs further exploration and the company  cvps and citizens utilities have signed confidentiality agreements so that such exploration may proceed 
consistent with the company s charter  we will consider the benefits of any merger or consolidation for our shareholders as well as the social  legal and economic effects upon our customers  employees  suppliers and others in similar relationships with us  and upon the communities in which we do business 
risk factors the major risk factors for the company arising from electric industry restructuring  including risks pertaining to the recovery of stranded costs  are regulatory and legal decisions  the market price of power  and the amount of market share retained by the company 
there can be no assurance that any final restructuring plan ordered by the vpsb  the courts  or through legislation will include a mechanism that would allow for full recovery of our stranded costs and include a fair return on those costs as they are being recovered 
if laws are enacted or regulatory decisions are made that do not offer an adequate opportunity to recover stranded costs  we believe we have compelling legal arguments to challenge such laws or decisions 
the largest category of our potential stranded costs is future costs under long term power purchase contracts  which  based on current forecasts  are above market 
we intend to pursue aggressively mitigation efforts in order to maximize the recovery of these costs 
the magnitude of our stranded costs is largely dependent upon the future market price of power 
we have discussed various market price scenarios with interested parties for the purpose of identifying stranded costs 
preliminary market price assumptions  which are likely to change  have resulted in estimates of the company s stranded costs of between million and million 
if retail competition is implemented in vermont  there will be an impact on the company s revenues from electricity sales 
however  we are unable to predict at this time the extent of this impact 
the company  itself or through another marketing affiliate  may elect to endeavor to retain and attract larger commercial customers in a competitive retail environment  but neither its relative prospects nor the margins it will realize on any such sales can be estimated at this time 
historically  electric utility rates have been based on a utility s cost of service 
as a result  electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that are not applicable to other business enterprises in general 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas allows regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
the company has established regulatory assets and liabilities under sfas as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company complies with the provisions of sfas in the event the company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for following sfas  the accounting impact would be an extraordinary  non cash charge to operations of an amount that could be material 
factors that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include deregulation  a change in the regulators approach to setting rates from cost based regulation to another form of regulation  increasing competition that limits our ability to sell utility services or product at rates that will recover costs  and regulatory actions that result from resistance to rate increases that limit our ability to sell utility services or products at rates that will recover costs if we are unable to obtain relief from prior regulatory actions through appeals to the vpsb or the courts 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources 
under sfas  accounting for contingencies  the enactment of restructuring legislation or issuance of a regulatory order containing provisions that do not allow for stranded cost recovery  consisting principally of above market power costs  would require the company to estimate and record losses immediately  on an undiscounted basis  for any above market power purchase contracts and other costs which are probable of not being recoverable from customers  to the extent that those costs are estimable 
we are unable to predict what form enacted legislation or such an order will take  and we cannot predict if or to what extent sfas will continue to be applicable in the future 
members of the staff of the securities and exchange commission have raised questions concerning the continued applicability of sfas to certain other electric utilities facing restructuring 
on july   the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board indicated that utilities should immediately discontinue application of sfas for those business segments which will become unregulated  if the utility has a final plan in place for transition to competition 
to the extent that the discontinued segment has stranded costs that are recoverable through rates  those costs would continue to be accounted for under sfas sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  requires that any assets  including regulatory assets  that are no longer probable of recovery through future revenues be revalued based upon future cash flows 
sfas requires that a rate regulated enterprise recognize an impairment loss for regulatory assets that are no longer probable of recovery 
as of december   based upon the regulatory environment within which we currently operate  no impairment loss was recorded 
competitive influences or regulatory developments may impact this status in the future 
we cannot predict whether restructuring legislation enacted by the vermont general assembly or any subsequent report or actions of  or proceedings before  the vpsb or the vermont general assembly would have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition or credit ratings 
the failure to recover a significant portion of our purchased power costs  or to retain and attract customers in a competitive environment  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  including our operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at current levels

unregulated businesses the following is a discussion of the company s unregulated enterprises 
our unregulated businesses lost cents per share of common stock in as compared to a loss of cents per share of common stock in mountain energy  inc mei  which invests in energy generation  energy efficiency and waste water treatment projects  lost million in  compared to earnings of million in the decrease in earnings was due primarily to continued start up operating losses incurred by micronair  llc and a write off related to a wind facility in california 
since its formation in  mei has invested more than million in operating energy projects  including two california wind projects  hydroelectric projects in california and new hampshire  a gas co generation facility in illinois and energy efficiency installations in maine  new york  new jersey  massachusetts and hawaii 
in  mei broadened its investment portfolio by acquiring an initial percent ownership interest in micronair  llc  which owns certain patent rights to a wastewater treatment system that provides an innovative and efficient solution to the bio solids disposal issues facing the united states 
the micronairr system enhances both the processing and energy efficiency at wastewater facilities  virtually eliminating bio solids as a byproduct 
in  mei acquired the remaining interest in micronair 
in  mei acquired a percent equity interest in castion corporation  an industrial wastewater treatment company 
castion s controlled atmospheric separation technology cast separates clean water from industrial process waste streams  in some cases recapturing valuable minerals and chemicals for reuse 
the potential market continues to grow as public and regulatory tolerance for wastewater discharges wanes 
castion has fourteen systems in commercial operation 
green mountain propane gas  limited gmpg  which sold propane gas at retail in vermont and new hampshire  experienced a  loss in as compared to a  loss in on february   gmpg and the company entered into a sales agreement with vgs propane  llc for the sale of all gmpg assets 
the sale was completed on march  the company s unregulated rental water heater business earned  in  a slight increase from s net income of  the and results contributed cents and cents of earnings  respectively  per share to the company s consolidated results 
green mountain resources  inc gmri was formed in april to explore opportunities in the emerging competitive retail energy market 
in  gmri lost million compared to a loss of million in gmri s loss in was primarily due to development costs associated with its investment in green mountain energy resources llc gmer 
on august   gmri entered into an agreement with green funding i  llc gfi  whereby gmri and gfi would jointly own gmer  a delaware limited liability company of which gmri was previously the sole owner 
gmer is a company that has created retail brands of electricity that are sold to consumers in competitive markets 
gmri received a payment of million from gmer at the closing in as reimbursement for certain development expenses gmri had incurred 
under the terms of the original agreement through which gfi acquired its interest in gmer  gmri s ownership percentage of gmer would be diluted if gfi and or third parties proposed to contribute additional capital to gmer  and gmri did not make pro rata additional capital contributions at such time 
during  gfi made additional  substantial investments in gmer and it was anticipated that gfi or other parties would make additional  substantial investments in gmri elected not to provide additional capital contributions  which reduced its ownership percentage in gmer 
in view of the likely need for future investment in gmer s business  we considered it to be in the best interest of our shareholders to sell gmri s remaining interest in gmer 
in december  gmri and gfi replaced the agreement with a new agreement  which among other things  provided for the sale of gmri s remaining interest in gmer in return for million to be paid and recorded as income in the first quarter of the funds were received and will be used for the company s general operating expenses 
the new agreement provides us substantial relief from a non compete clause in the agreement that would have restricted our activities in the retail energy business for seven years

 in  total electricity sales decreased percent due principally to a decrease in wholesale sales caused by a reduction in low margin  off system sales 
total operating revenues increased percent in total retail revenues increased percent in primarily due to a percent increase in sales of electricity to our commercial and industrial customers resulting from increased use of air conditioning during the spring and summer months  and a percent retail rate increase for service rendered march  the increase was partially offset by a percent reduction in sales to residential customers caused by warmer than normal winter months 
wholesale revenues decreased percent in primarily due to a reduction in low margin  off system sales 
total operating revenues were virtually unchanged in total retail revenues increased percent in primarily due to an increase in sales of electricity to our small commercial and industrial customers resulting from modest customer growth and an increase in sales to ibm 
the increase in retail revenues was nearly offset by a percent decrease in wholesale revenues caused by a reduction in low margin  off system sales  which had a minimal impact on earnings and a percent decrease in other operating revenues caused by a one time adjustment in to account for higher charges under a transmission and interconnection agreement between cvps and the company 
ibm  the company s single largest customer  operates manufacturing facilities in essex junction  vermont 
ibm s electricity requirements for its main plant and an adjacent plant accounted for   and percent of our operating revenues in  and  respectively 
no other retail customer accounted for more than one percent of our revenue in any such year 
in february  the company and ibm entered into an economic development agreement eda i that governed the prices to be paid by ibm at its essex junction facility for incremental electric usage during  and the contract  intended to promote growth in ibm s operations and create jobs in our service area  applied only to that portion of ibm s load that exceeded its consumption level 
most of ibm s electric usage is billed under our tariff rate 
the eda i price  although lower than our tariff rate  exceeded our marginal costs of providing this incremental electric service to ibm 
the vpsb approved the eda i in june prior to the expiration of the eda i on december   the company and ibm negotiated a new  similar eda eda ii 
the agreement has most of the features of the eda i  including use of the base to determine incremental load and pricing above our marginal costs 
a separate pricing provision applies to load above levels 
the agreement is for one year  subject to extension for another year at ibm s option 
the vpsb approved the eda ii on may we believe that the eda i and eda ii benefit us because the agreements encourage the incremental purchase of electricity by ibm at a price above our marginal cost of providing such incremental service 
power supply expenses power supply expenses constituted percent  percent and percent of total operating expenses for the years  and  respectively 
these expenses increased by million percent in and  percent in total power supply expenses increased percent in primarily due to the absence in of the million reduction of hydro quebec power costs resulting from the rate treatment of a payment received from hydro quebec in  a million loss accrued in resulting from the continued disallowance of hydro quebec power costs during  and a million increase in scheduled hydro quebec contract capacity costs in company owned generation increased percent in due to an increase in the use of high cost generating facilities that replaced power that was unavailable from hydro quebec during a severe ice storm that affected much of vermont  the northeast united states and quebec in january total power supply expenses were slightly higher in  although the cost of several individual sources were significantly different from their costs in power supply expenses from vermont yankee increased percent in primarily due to the deferral in and the amortization in of costs associated with a scheduled refueling outage 
company owned generation expenses increased percent in primarily due to the increased usage of company owned plants necessitated by the outage of certain nuclear power plants in the region 
these increases were nearly offset by a percent decrease in power supply expenses from other resources primarily due to the recognition of million received from hydro quebec under a memorandum of understanding entered into in as described below consistent with a vpsb accounting order dated december  during  we negotiated an arrangement with hydro quebec that reduces the cost impacts associated with the purchase of schedules b and c under the contract over the november through october period the july agreement 
under the july agreement  we will  in essence  take delivery of the amounts of energy as specified in the contract  but the associated fixed costs will be significantly reduced from those specified in the contract 
as part of the july agreement  we are obligated to purchase million in dollars worth of research and development work from hydro quebec over the four year period  and made a million in dollars cash payment to hydro quebec in hydro quebec retains the right to curtail annual energy deliveries by percent up to five times  over the to period  if documented drought conditions exist in quebec 
under an arrangement negotiated in january  we received cash payments from hydro quebec of million in and million in consistent with allowed ratemaking treatment  the million payment reduced purchase power expense by million in  the balance of the payment reduced power costs in the million payment reduced purchase power expense ratably over the period beginning june and ending may we received vpsb approval of this accounting treatment in an accounting order dated december  under the arrangement we are required to shift up to megawatts of our schedule c deliveries to an alternate transmission path  and use the associated portion of the nepool hydro quebec interconnection facilities to purchase power for the period from september through june at prices that vary based upon conditions in effect when the purchases are made 
the arrangement also provides for minimum payments by the company to hydro quebec for periods in which power is not purchased under the arrangement 
although our level of benefits will depend on various factors  we estimate that the arrangement will provide a minimum benefit of million on a net present value basis 
during  we purchased or sold to others percent of the minimum purchase obligation for that year 
we recorded a liability of million for our remaining minimum purchase obligation 
under a separate agreement executed on december   hydro quebec provided a cash payment of million to the company in in return for this payment  we provided hydro quebec an option for the purchase of power 
commencing april  and effective through the term of the contract  hydro quebec can exercise an option to purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis  at energy prices established in accordance with the contract  for an amount of energy equivalent to the company s firm capacity entitlements in the contract 
the cumulative amount of energy purchased over the remaining term of the contract shall not exceed  mwh 
hydro quebec s option to curtail energy deliveries pursuant to the july agreement can be exercised in addition to this purchase option 
over the same period  hydro quebec can exercise an option on an annual basis to purchase up to  mwh at the contract energy price 
hydro quebec can purchase no more than  mwh in any given year 
in  hydro quebec called on us to deliver  mwh to a third party at a net cost to us of  which was due to higher energy replacement costs 
see note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company and the other vermont joint owners vjo of the hydro quebec contract have sought arbitration to determine whether the suspension of deliveries of power to vermont during and after the january ice storm constitutes a default by hydro quebec under the terms of the contract  or if there are other possible claims against hydro quebec arising from the suspension of deliveries 
hydro quebec appears to maintain that the force majeure superior or irreversible force provision in the contract applies  which could excuse its non delivery of power under certain circumstances 
arbitration of the dispute may lead to one or more remedies having an impact on our obligation under the contract

ms will sell to us  at a predefined price  power sufficient to serve pre established load requirements 
ms has the right but not the obligation  upon a request from us  to supply additional power at prices negotiated by both parties 
the power sold to us may be  but is not required to be  power that ms has purchased from us under the transaction described above 
the parties have agreed to the protocols that will be used to schedule power sales and purchases between the parties and to secure necessary transmission with respect to the two transactions described above 
the ppsa provides us with a means of managing price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
we remain responsible for balancing supply resources when actual loads vary from the pre established load requirements that ms is obligated to satisfy  and for resource performance and availability 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased percent in primarily due to higher overhead costs resulting from less overhead charged to gmri  whose earnings are accounted for on the equity basis  losses associated with the expected termination of the lease for our corporate headquarters building  and charges associated with a workforce reduction in other operating expenses decreased percent in primarily due to an increase in work performed on behalf of gmri  effectively reducing payroll and overhead expenses for the company 
additionally  the organizational changes attributable to the creation of gmer resulted in fewer company employees  causing a reduction in payroll expense 
transmission expenses transmission expenses decreased percent in primarily due to a refund received from cvps in as a result of reduced levels of demand on the cvps transmission system in we also received a refund in for charges that were incorrectly assessed to us during by new england power company 
transmission expenses increased percent in primarily due to higher tariffs under a new operating agreement with new england power company 
maintenance expenses maintenance expenses increased percent in primarily due to scheduled plant maintenance activities at the stony brook plant and the repair of damage caused by lightning at our wind facility 
maintenance expenses increased percent in due to scheduled increases in plant maintenance 
depreciation and amortization in  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased percent primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of expenditures related to the pine street barge canal site as a result of the vpsb order of february   which suspended the amortization charges 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expenses associated with additional investment in our utility plant 
depreciation and amortization expenses were virtually unchanged in income taxes the effective federal income tax rates for the years  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
income taxes decreased in due to a decrease in taxable income 
the increase in income taxes is primarily due to an increase in taxable income  an increase in the combined federal and state income tax rate and an increase in the reserve for unaudited income tax years 
other income other income decreased million in  as compared to  primarily due to a million afer tax loss experienced by mountain energy  inc resulting from a million net write off of a wind power investment and start up operating losses incurred by micronair llc  and a  disallowance in costs associated with the wind facility ordered by the vpsb in its february  order 
in addition  the allowance for funds used during construction decreased in resulting from lower construction work in progress balances during the period 
these decreases were partially offset by million reduction in losses experienced by gmri due to the absence of start up expenses in as compared to other income decreased percent in primarily due to diminished results by two of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
mountain energy  inc  the company s subsidiary that invests in energy generation and energy and waste water efficiency projects  earned million less in primarily due to start up operating losses incurred by micronair llc  a company in which mountain energy bought a percent interest in  and a decline in rates paid for power generated by one of the california wind facilities in which it has invested 
gmri s loss in was million greater than the loss in due primarily to the development costs of its investment in gmer  the retail energy company in which the company sold a controlling interest during the third quarter of interest charges interest charges increased percent in primarily due to an increase in short term interest expense related to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding during the year and a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction resulting from lower construction work in progress balances in the increases were partially offset by a decrease in long term interest charges related to a lower amount of long term debt outstanding in interest charges increased percent in primarily due to an increase in long term interest related to the sale of million and million of our first mortgage bonds in november and december  respectively 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest charges related to a lower amount of short term debt outstanding during the year 
dividends on preferred stock dividends on preferred stock decreased by percent in primarily due to the repurchase in of the following preferred stock shares of the percent  class b   shares of the percent  class d  series  and  shares of the percent  class d  series dividends on preferred stock increased percent in and percent in primarily due to the issuance of  shares of the company s percent  class e  series preferred stock in october transmission issues federal open access tariff orders on april   the ferc issued orders and which  among other things  required the filing of open access transmission tariffs by electric utilities  and the functional separation by utilities of their transmission operations from power marketing operations 
order also supports the full recovery of legitimate and verifiable wholesale power costs previously incurred under federal or state regulation 
on july   we filed with the ferc the non discriminatory open access tariffs required by order and subsequent modifications to the tariff 
the tariff defined our transmission system to include sub transmission facilities that we own including phase i and phase ii facilities and our entitlement to facilities owned by velco 
our tariffs included charges related to the use of the velco transmission system by customers 
other vermont utilities required to make filings with the ferc under order followed the same course of action 
on july   the ferc approved our open access transmission tariff  and on august   we filed our compliance refund report 
in accordance with order  we have also functionally separated our transmission operations and filed with the ferc a code of conduct for our transmission operations 
we are currently revising the code of conduct in response to a ferc order issued on november  we do not anticipate any material adverse effects or loss of wholesale customers due to the ferc orders mentioned above 
nepool transmission tariff under an allocation agreement among velco  northeast utilities and new england power corporation the three party agreement  velco currently has percent of the capacity of transmission facilities between new england  new york and canada 
velco s capacity for such transmission facilities is allocated among vermont electric utilities  including the company 
our ability to use these delivery paths has been adversely impacted by a proposed nepool open access tariff nepool fourth supplement to amendment on file with the ferc 
under the tariff  transmission capability or transfer capacity between new york and new england will no longer be allocated in a manner consistent with the three party agreement 
instead  rights to the transfer capacity will be made more generally available to the market subject to certain contingencies related to nepool generation availability and accounting for the delivery of various grand fathered contracts 
efforts by us and other velco members to negotiate with nepool participants for the preservation of rights to deliver long term firm contracts necessary to serve native load on these delivery routes were unsuccessful 
consequently  on november  velco filed with the ferc on behalf of the vermont utilities including the company a motion to intervene and seeking summary judgment with respect to the nepool filing of the fourth supplement to amendment the company and other vermont utilities have argued that the fourth supplement was a proposal to terminate the vermont utilities existing and future rights under the three party agreement allocating the new york and new england transmission ties and  specifically  the pv tie with the new york power authority nypa 
the ferc  in an order dated april   took no action on velco s motion other than to recommend that velco seek resolution of the issue pursuant to the dispute resolution process under the proposed nepool open access tariff 
the vermont utilities continue to deliberate on the appropriate approach to the nepool open access tariff dispute resolution process  which includes an assessment of economic consequences of the tariff as currently implied 
environmental matters the electric industry typically uses or generates a range of potentially hazardous products in its operations 
we must meet various land  water  air and aesthetic requirements as administered by local  state and federal regulatory agencies 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements  and that there are no outstanding material complaints about our compliance with present environmental protection regulations  except for developments related to the pine street barge canal site 
we maintain a program to ensure that we are in compliance with environmental regulations 
this includes employee training  regular inspection of our facilities  research and development projects  waste handling and spill prevention procedures  program monitoring and other activities 
pine street barge canal site the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  commonly known as the superfund law  generally imposes strict  joint and several liability  regardless of fault  for remediation of property contaminated with hazardous substances 
we have been notified by the environmental protection agency epa that we are one of several potentially responsible parties prps for cleanup of the pine street barge canal site in burlington  vermont  where coal tar and other industrial materials were deposited 
from the late th century until  gas was manufactured at the pine street barge canal site by a number of enterprises  including the company 
in  we were one of the parties that agreed to pay a total of  of the epa s past response costs under a consent decree 
we remain a prp for other past  ongoing and future response costs 
in november  the epa proposed a cleanup plan estimated by the epa to cost million 
in june  the epa withdrew this cleanup plan in response to public concern about the plan and its cost 
in  the epa established a coordinating council  with representatives of the prps  environmental and community groups  the city of burlington and the state of vermont  presided over by a neutral facilitator 
in june  the coordinating council reached a consensus agreement on a recommended plan for remediation of the pine street barge canal site 
as part of the council s process of reaching a consensus recommendation  the company and certain other parties conditionally agreed to fund environmentally beneficial projects in the greater burlington area  the cost of which may reach million 
in june  the epa formally proposed the council s recommended plan and received public comments 
on september   the epa issued its final record of decision  announcing selection of the proposed remedy 
the proposed remedy includes construction of an underwater cover over canal sediments that present the highest risk to the environment  placement of a soil cap over certain contaminated wetland areas and restoration of those areas  improvements that will better distribute storm water entering the site  and monitoring of the site to ensure that the cap is effective over the long term and that harmful contamination does not migrate offsite 
the epa estimates that the present value cost of the remedy would be million  although actual costs may be higher 
as of december   our total expenditures related to the pine street barge canal site since were approximately million 
this includes those amounts not recovered in rates  amounts recovered in rates  and amounts for which rate recovery has been sought but which are presently awaiting further vpsb action 
the bulk of these expenditures consisted of transaction costs 
transaction costs include legal and consulting costs associated with the company s opposition to the epa s earlier proposals for the site  as well as litigation and related costs necessary to obtain settlements with insurers and other prps to provide amounts required to fund the clean up remediation costs and to address liability claims at the site 
a smaller amount of past expenditures was for site related response costs  including costs incurred pursuant to the epa and state orders that resulted in funding response activities at the site  and to reimbursing the epa and the state for oversight and related response costs 
the epa and the state have asserted and affirmed that all costs related to these orders are appropriate costs of response under cercla for which the company and other prps were legally responsible 
the epa has made claims against us for additional past costs associated with the pine street barge canal site in an amount exceeding million 
the epa also has advised us that we may be responsible for implementation of further response activities at the site 
in early  the united states and the state asked us to begin fast track negotiation of tentative terms of settlement of all cost reimbursement and natural resource damages claims of the united states and the state 
those negotiations began immediately  and included discussion of our potential contribution claims against the united states 
in may  a confidential tentative agreement was reached on issues under discussion 
we expect to complete negotiation soon of a final settlement with the united states and the state over terms of a consent decree that will cover claims addressed in the earlier negotiations and implementation of the selected remedy 
the consent decree must be submitted to a federal court for approval and adoption as its order 
we have entered into various confidential settlement agreements with other prps that provide for sharing of past response costs  future cleanup costs and related future federal and state monetary claims 
we estimate that we have recovered or secured  or will recover  through past settlements of litigation claims against insurers and other parties  amounts that exceed estimated future remediation costs  future federal and state government oversight costs and past epa response costs 
we have concluded that our unrecovered transaction costs mentioned above  which were necessary to recover settlements sufficient to remediate the site  to oppose much more costly solutions proposed by the epa  to resolve monetary claims of the epa and the state and to remediate the site  are likely to be in the range of to million 
in  we recorded a liability of million to recognize the low end of this range of costs 
the estimated liability is not discounted  and it is possible that our estimate of future costs could change by a material amount 
we also have recorded an offsetting regulatory asset and we believe it is probable that we will receive future revenues to recover these costs 
through rate cases filed in    and  we sought and received recovery for ongoing expenses associated with the pine street barge canal site 
specifically  we proposed rate recognition of our non recovered expenditures incurred between january  and june  in the total of approximately million for technical consultants and legal assistance in connection with the epa s enforcement action at the site and insurance litigation 
while reserving the right to argue in the future about the appropriateness of full rate recovery of the pine street barge canal costs  the department  and as applicable  other intervenors  reached agreements with the company in these cases that the full amount of the pine street barge canal costs reflected in those rate cases should be recovered in rates 
our rates  as approved by the vpsb in those proceedings  reflected the pine street barge canal related expenditures referred to above 
we proposed in our rate filing made on june   recovery of an additional million in such expenditures 
in an order in that case released march   the vpsb suspended the amortization of expenditures associated with the pine street barge canal site pending further proceedings 
although it did not eliminate the rate base deferral of these expenditures  or make any specific order in this regard  the vpsb indicated that it was inclined to agree with other parties in the case that the ultimate costs associated with the pine street barge canal site  taking into account recoveries from insurance carriers and other prps  should be shared between customers and shareholders of the company 
in response to our motion for reconsideration  the vpsb on june   stated our intent  and we believe the fair reading of our order  was to reserve for a future docket issues pertaining to the sharing of remediation releated costs between the company and its customers 
see retail rate case below 
an authoritative accounting standard  statement of position sop  has been issued by the accounting profession addressing environmental remediation obligations 
this sop is effective for years beginning in  and addresses  among other things  regulatory benchmarks that are likely triggers of the accrual of estimated losses  the costs included in the measurement  including incremental costs of remediation efforts such as post remediation monitoring and long term operation and maintenance costs and costs of compensation and related benefits of employees devoting time to the remediation 
this sop  adopted by the company in january as required  did not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in clean air act because we purchase most of our power supply from other utilities  we do not anticipate that we will incur any material direct cost increases as a result of the federal clean air act or proposals to make more stringent regulations under that act 
furthermore  only one of our power supply purchase contracts  which expired in early  related to a generating plant that was affected by phase i of the acid rain provisions of this legislation  which went into effect january  liquidity and capital resources construction our capital requirements result from the need to construct facilities or to invest in programs to meet anticipated customer demand for electric service 
if restructuring does occur  we will reassess our capital expenditures for generation and other projects and the terms of financing thereof 
capital expenditures over the past three years and forecasted for are as follows dollars in thousands and net of afudc and customer advances for construction total net generation transmission distribution conservation other expenditures actual forecasted includes and million for wind project in and  respectively 
includes million related to pine street barge canal site 
retail rate case on june   the company filed a request with the vpsb to increase retail rates by percent million in additional annual revenues and to increase the target return on common equity from percent to percent 
in our final submissions to the vpsb we asked for an increase of percent million in additional annual revenues due to changed estimates of costs to be incurred in the rate year 
on march   the vpsb released its order dated february   in the then pending rate case 
the vpsb authorized us to increase our rates by percent  which gave us increased annual revenues of million 
the difference between the million we asked for and the million the vpsb authorized was due to the following disallowance of the cost of power associated with the hydro quebec contract discussed below  the vpsb s modification of our calculation of rate base  the exclusion of future capital projects from rate base  suspension of recovery of pine street barge canal site expenditures  various cost of service reductions in payroll and operations and maintenance  and a reduction in our requested allowed return on equity from percent to percent 
the vpsb order denied us the right to charge customers million of the annual costs for power purchased under our contract with hydro quebec 
the vpsb denied recovery of these costs for the following reasons the vpsb claimed that we had acted imprudently by committing to the power contract with hydro quebec in august the imprudence disallowance  and to the extent that the costs of power to be purchased from hydro quebec are now higher than current estimates of market prices for power during the contract term  after accounting for the imprudence disallowance  the contract power is not used and useful 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap required that we record in the first quarter of the losses resulting from the disallowed recovery of a portion of the hydro quebec power contract costs 
the amount charged to first quarter income of million pre tax was less than the full disallowance because we expected that new rates would become effective in january as the result of our may  rate filing 
the agreement to suspend our rate case  as described below  delays the date of a final decision on the rate case to december   and we recognized an additional loss of million in the last quarter of representing the effect of the presumed continued disallowance of hydro quebec power costs through december  in its february  order  the vpsb described its policies that do not allow a utility to recover imprudent expenditures and the costs of power supply contract purchases that the vpsb decides are not used and useful 
the vpsb also stated in its order that the methods and measures used in this rate case were provisional and applied to this rate case only 
if the vpsb were to apply the same  or similar  methods and measures that they used in the rate case order to future power contract costs in our retail rate case  we would likely be required to take a charge to income of approximately million pre tax 
this million estimate represents primarily the percent disallowance for hydro quebec power costs that the vpsb considered imprudent in its order 
we will not be able to estimate the loss to be recorded for power purchased after december   if any  until the pending rate case is completed 
if the vpsb does not modify in future regulatory proceedings its ruling that the costs of power purchased from hydro quebec are above estimated market rates and are not used and useful and  therefore  a portion of such costs is not recoverable  we would likely conclude that the vpsb has changed its approach to setting rates from cost based rate making to another form of regulation 
we would then be required to discontinue application of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  described below  and eliminate all regulatory assets and liabilities that arose from prior actions of the vpsb 
the write off of these regulatory assets and liabilities  net of any tax effects  would be charged to income as an extraordinary item for the financial reporting period in which the discontinuation of sfas occurs 
sfas provides guidance in preparing financial statements for public utilities that meet certain criteria of sfas the three criteria that we must meet in order to follow the accounting guidance under sfas are our rates for regulated services and products provided to our customers must be established by or be subject to approval by an independent  third party regulator  the regulated rates are designed to recover our specific costs of providing the regulated services or products  and depending on demand for regulated services and products  and the level of competition  direct and indirect  it is reasonable to assume that our rates are set at levels that will recover our costs and that these rates can be charged to and collected from our customers 
this criterion must also take into account anticipated changes in levels of demand or competition during the recovery period for any capitalized costs 
we meet these criteria at present and  therefore the provisions of sfas apply to us 
under sfas we are required to defer certain costs that would typically be expensed under gaap  these costs are referred to as deferred charges or regulatory assets 
our ability to defer a cost is subject to our ability to provide evidence that the following additional criteria are met it is probable that the inclusion of the capitalized deferred cost in allowed costs for ratemaking purposes will provide future revenue in an amount at least equal to the capitalized deferred cost  and the future revenue will be provided to permit recovery of the previously incurred cost rather than to provide for expected levels of similar future costs 
based on the december  balance sheet  if we were required to discontinue the application of sfas  we would be required to take an after tax charge to earnings of approximately million attributable to net regulatory assets 
on march   we filed with the vpsb a motion for reconsideration of and to alter or amend the vpsb s order released on march  the principal areas in which we requested that the vpsb change its ruling included the following a correction to the vpsb s calculation of the million hydro quebec contract power cost disallowance  reversal of the accounting treatment specified by the vpsb for cash payments made by hydro quebec under arrangements that we had previously negotiated in order to avoid rate increases in prior years for customers  restoration of  of costs associated with the construction of the searsburg wind generation facility  restoration of various other compensation and payroll costs  reversal of the suspension of amortization of costs associated with the pine street barge canal site  and reconsideration of our request to increase the allowed rate of return from percent to percent 
immediately following the issuance of the june  vpsb order on our motion for reconsideration  which largely reaffirmed the earlier order  duff phelps and standard poor s lowered our securities credit ratings 
moody s also subsequently lowered our securities credit ratings 
in june  we appealed the vpsb s february  order and the june  reconsideration order to the vermont supreme court 
the briefing of the case by all parties was completed in january a hearing before the vermont supreme court is scheduled for march  a number of other vermont utilities have submitted briefs in support of the company 
we believe that the decisions in the vpsb s february  order and june  reconsideration order are factually inaccurate and legally incorrect 
specifically  we are appealing the vpsb s determination that we were imprudent in committing to the hydro quebec contract in august  and vpsb ruling that because the contract power is priced over market under current forecasts of market prices  it is therefore considered not used and useful 
the company asserts  among other arguments  that the vpsb s order deprives the company s shareholders of their property in an unconstitutional manner 
the vpsb s decision  if not changed  could have a significant negative impact on our reported financial condition  and could impact our credit ratings  dividend policy and financial viability 
retail rate case on may   we filed a request with the vpsb to increase our retail rates by percent due to the following increases in our cost of service the higher cost of power  the cost of the january ice storm  and investments in new plant and equipment 
the vpsb suspended the tariff filings on june  we submitted testimony in the case that included analysis of viable alternatives to the hydro quebec contract at various times in and the vpsb had taken the viewpoint in our rate case that we would have been able to terminate the hydro quebec contract without penalty during that time period  and would have been able to access the market for power at that time 
our analysis showed that  based on price only  the hydro quebec contract was less expensive than virtually all other long term power resources available at that time 
the analysis also showed that when other non price benefits  like environmental benefits and the reliability of a system power resource  are taken into account  the hydro quebec contract was still less costly than alternatives 
we have testified that even today  when costs and benefits for society are accounted for  as vermont regulators and statutes require  the hydro quebec power is not more costly than market power 
in testimony submitted on september   the vermont department of public service department argued for the following a million disallowance of hydro quebec contract costs  a rate decrease of percent  the elimination of our common stock dividend  and various other restrictions 
additionally  the department s recommendation was that approximately million of the disallowance of hydro quebec contract costs be suspended for one year  which would provide us with a percent rate increase only for that year  followed by automatic reinstatement of the larger power cost disallowance with a resulting decrease in from our rate levels today  absent further vpsb order 
the department recommended this one year delay in the hydro quebec contract cost disallowance in order to allow us time to negotiate lower costs of power under the hydro quebec contract 
ibm  our largest customer  argued for a rate decrease of percent  a disallowance of hydro quebec power costs in the amount of million  and the elimination of the common stock dividend 
in our rebuttal case  we intended to present the vpsb with testimony that the department s and ibm s recommendations amount to improper rate making that will have adverse economic and accounting impacts under applicable accounting rules  the only cogent evidence of alternative portfolios of power resources available in presented to the vpsb is from our witnesses and the only conclusion that can be drawn from that evidence justifies a determination that there should be no hydro quebec power contract cost disallowance  and we require substantial rate relief in order to ensure our financial stability  access to capital markets and the continuation of adequate  reliable and safe service to our customers 
we also intended to present to the vpsb considerable evidence that we have made  and continue to make  efforts to achieve a negotiated reformulation of the arrangement with hydro quebec  placing us at risk of bankruptcy will not improve our prospects of achieving success in such a negotiation  bankruptcy reorganization is not an appropriate public policy solution to high power cost obligations  and our default of obligations to hydro quebec and other creditors would cause substantial risks of default in the same contractual relationships by many other vermont utilities under step up or similar provisions contained in such arrangements 
on november   by memorandum of understanding mou  the company  the department and ibm agreed to stay  effective november   rate proceedings in the rate case until or after september   or such earlier date as the parties may later agree to or the vpsb may order 
the mou provides for a percent temporary retail rate increase  to produce million in annualized additional revenue  effective with service rendered december  an additional surcharge in will be permitted  without further vpsb order  in order to produce additional revenues necessary to provide the company with the capacity to finance estimated pine street barge canal site expenditures of million 
the stay and suspension of this pending rate case and the temporary rate levels agreed to in the mou are designed to allow us to continue to provide adequate and efficient service to our customers while we seek mitigation of power supply costs 
following the stay  which expires on september  or such earlier date as agreed to by the parties or ordered by the vpsb  the remaining proceedings in the case would commence and  as noted above  a final vpsb decision would be issued by december  in the event that the vpsb issues a final order that allows a retail rate increase that is less than the temporary rates  all sums collected in excess of such final rates would be refunded by adjusting rates on a prospective basis  by customer class  to reflect the appropriate refund amounts 
the mou does not provide for any specific disallowance of power costs under our purchase power contract with hydro quebec 
issues respecting recovery of such power costs are preserved for future proceedings 
we agreed not to file with the vpsb a petition requesting any further increase in retail electric rates prior to september   except that this mou does not preclude us from filing a request for additional temporary rate increases pursuant to vsa section a 
the temporary rates include million that is to be used for enhanced right of way maintenance and pole testing and treatment 
regulatory asset account balances of million  which are subject to recovery in this docket  are to be amortized over seven years  beginning january these balances reflect only the amount filed in the may rate case  and are related to regulatory commission expense  tree trimming  storm damage and the costs associated with the ice storm of this amortization period will be subject to review by the vpsb after the expiration of the stay 
in the event that the vermont supreme court issues an order reversing the vpsb s orders in our rate case prior to issuance of a final order in the rate case  any resulting adjustments in rates will not become effective until the vpsb issues a final order in the rate case 
the mou provides that nothing in it will reduce or limit our entitlement to full recovery of any amounts due us if we should prevail on the appeal 
the mou was approved by the vpsb on december  the temporary rates  as adjusted by any surcharge related to the pine street barge canal site described above  will remain in effect until the vpsb issues a final order in the rate case docket  expected by december  notwithstanding the interim rate settlement  we are unable to predict whether the mou or other future events  singularly or in combination  could cause our lending banks to refuse to allow further borrowings under our revolving loan agreement  to seek to enter into a new credit agreement with us and or to immediately call in all outstanding loans 
if we are unable to borrow on a short term basis  we will evaluate all potential alternatives available at the time  including  but not limited to  the filing of a petition for reorganization under the united states bankruptcy code 
dividend policy on november   the board of directors of the company announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend on the company s common stock from per share to per share 
the new indicated annual dividend rate is per share 
our dividend policy reflects changes affecting the electric utility industry  which is moving away from the traditional cost of service regulatory model to a competition based market for power supply  as well as earnings projections associated with the rate case developments referred to above 
our current environment has prompted us to reassess the appropriateness of our dividend 
the board of directors will continue to assess and adjust the dividend when appropriate  as the vermont electricity industry evolves towards competition 
in addition  if other events beyond our control cause our financial situation to deteriorate further  the board of directors will also consider whether the current dividend level is appropriate or if the dividend should be reduced or eliminated 
financing and capitalization for the period through  internally generated funds  after payment of dividends  provided approximately percent of total capital requirements for construction  sinking funds and other requirements 
internally generated funds provided percent of such requirements for we anticipate that for  internally generated funds will provide approximately percent of total capital requirements for regulated operations 
at december   our capitalization consisted of percent common equity  percent long term debt and percent preferred equity 
we have a revolving credit agreement in the amount of million with three banks  with borrowings outstanding of million on december  we also have an uncommitted line of credit in the amount of  under which no amounts were outstanding at december  the revolving credit agreement requires us to certify on a quarterly basis that we have not suffered a material adverse change 
similarly  as a condition to further borrowings  we must certify that nothing has happened that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on us since the date that we last borrowed under this agreement 
when the vpsb issued its order dated february   disallowing certain costs associated with our contract to purchase power from hydro quebec  the three banks required modification of the terms of the revolving credit agreement that had been made originally on august   which was unsecured and had a three year term 
the modified agreement allows us to continue to borrow until such time that a material adverse effect has occurred  we are no longer in compliance with all other provisions of the agreement  in which case further borrowing will not be permitted  or there has been a material adverse change  in which case the banks may declare us in default 
the modified terms also call in part for the following a reduction in the term of the agreement from three years to one year  expiring june  a second priority mortgage  lien and security interest in the collateral pledged under our first mortgage bond indenture granted to the banks  and an increase in the interest rates  facility fees and other fees required to be paid by us under the agreement 
required regulatory approval was obtained on june  the restated credit agreement and related loan documents were effective on august  there are a number of future events that  singularly or in combination  could lead the banks to refuse to allow further borrowings under the existing credit agreement  to seek to enter into a new credit agreement with us and or to immediately call in all outstanding loans 
some of those events are the vpsb issues an order in our pending rate case that triggers a material adverse change for us  or hydro quebec is unwilling to make new arrangements regarding the cost of power that we purchase under our contract with them 
due to the negative outcome of the rate case  which was decided by the vpsb s orders dated february and june   see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the credit ratings of our securities by the three rating agencies that rate us were lowered as follows duff phelps moody s standard poor s from to from to from to first mortgage bonds bbb bbb baa baa a bbb unsecured medium term bbb bbb bbb bb preferred stock bbb bb baa ba bbb bb standard poor s also lowered our corporate credit rating from bbb to bbb 
duff phelps and standard poor s credit ratings for us were placed and remain on rating watch down and credit watch negative  respectively  due to the high level of regulatory and public policy uncertainty in vermont and certain positions argued by the department in our rate cases 
moody s also lowered our ratings due to a difficult regulatory environment in vermont and the resulting high degree of financial uncertainty for gmp and placed all of our ratings on review for possible further downgrade 
see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the bank credit facilities available to the company 
standard poor s announced the generic implementation of a single credit rating scale for both debt and preferred stock 
as a result  on february   they re rated all preferred stock issues  including the company s  which resulted in the company s preferred stock being rated bb 
corporate headquarters lease as part of our efforts to reduce operating costs  we evaluated options to our corporate headquarters lease  which runs through june we are in the process of negotiating the termination of our operating lease for our corporate headquarters and two of our service centers 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is probable that we will purchase the lease and sell our corporate headquarters in we have recorded a loss of approximately million pre tax in to reflect the probable loss of completing these transactions 
we would retain ownership of our two service centers 
year computer compliance we use computer software  hardware  and other equipment in our business that could be affected by the date transition to the next century 
our primary year concern is the possibility of interruptions in delivery of electricity to our customers 
we are not able to predict the impact of any interruption on our operations or earnings  but the impact could be material 
in the past several years  we purchased and have nearly completed installing new customer service and financial management systems 
these systems have greatly reduced our exposure to date related problems 
we will implement and test further upgrades to these systems during to ensure that they are year compliant 
we have also replaced equipment that would have been affected by the date change 
management has established a project team to address year issues 
the team is focused on three elements that are integral to the project business continuity  project management and risk management 
business continuity involves the continuation of reliable electric supply and service in a safe and cost effective manner 
project management involves defining and meeting the project scope schedule and budget 
risk management involves customer management  contingency planning and legal issues 
in addition to these internal efforts  we are working with various industry groups to coordinate electric utility industry year efforts 
the approach to identifying and addressing non compliant software applications and embedded systems consists of the following stages inventory and awareness  assessment  renovation  testing and implementation 
the first stage is to inventory all applications and systems 
the assessment stage involves determining whether software applications and embedded systems are year compliant and prioritizing remediation needs based on risk management 
the renovation stage involves remediating or upgrading applications and systems to make them year ready 
the testing stage determines whether the renovated applications and systems are year ready 
the implementation stage occurs when the tested applications and systems are deployed 
we have also developed contingency plans for major outages and are adapting these to the special problems posed by the date change to the next century 
if an unexpected outage does occur we can operate equipment manually and will have personnel at important locations on new years eve and into our year project focuses on those facets of our business that are required to deliver reliable electric service 
the project encompasses the computer systems that support our core business functions such as customer information and billing  finance  procurement  supply and personnel as well as the components of metering  transmission  distribution and generation support 
the project also focuses on embedded systems  instrumentation and control systems in facilities 
the following table summarizes the status of our progress toward achieving year readiness 
the figures set forth in the table represent the estimated extent to which each phase of the year project for software applications and embedded systems have been completed

our current schedule is subject to change  depending on developments that may arise through unforeseen business circumstances  and through remediation and testing phases of our compliance effort 
our ability to deliver electricity to our customers could also be impacted if one of our major power suppliers or vendors of telecommunication service experienced a date related system failure 
an interruption in power supplied by other delivery systems  such as the independent system operator iso for new england  could also cause power delivery problems for us 
we are participating in the efforts of the iso s new england joint oversight committee to ensure that the systems and delivery of electricity in new england are in compliance 
we have asked these companies to send written reports on their status in eliminating year issues that could negatively affect their ability to serve us 
all other major vendors or businesses that we depend on for services or supplies have also been asked to report on their status 
the total cost of remediating or upgrading software that would not otherwise be replaced in accordance with our business plans is approximately  approximately  has been expended as of december  for external labor  hardware and software costs  and for the costs of employees who are dedicated to the year project 
the foregoing amounts do not include the cost of new software applications installed as a result of strategic replacement projects described earlier 
such replacement projects have not been accelerated because of year issues 
the cost of the project and the dates on which we plan to complete our year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third parties year readiness and other factors 
further  we expect to incur additional costs after to remediate and replace less critical software applications and embedded systems 
we have also begun the process of developing contingency plans to address the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios that could occur in the event that various year issues are not resolved in a timely manner 
contingency planning is an ongoing process and will continue through the fourth quarter of the phases of our contingency planning process include business impact analysis  contingency planning and testing 
business impact analysis requires business unit personnel to evaluate the impact of mission critical systems failure on our core business operations  focusing on specific failure scenarios and how they can be mitigated 
the necessary conditions for enacting the plans will be documented along with the appropriate personnel responsible in each of the business units should a year failure occur 
additionally we have participated in system readiness drills to simulate major outages and restart capability and will continue to participate in scheduled drills in based on our current schedule for completion of year tasks  we believe that our planning is adequate to secure year readiness of our critical systems 
nevertheless  achieving year readiness is subject to various risks and uncertainties  many of which are described above 
we are not able to predict all the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations as to our year readiness 
however  if we  or third parties with whom we have significant business relationships  fail to achieve year readiness with respect to critical systems  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
effects of inflation financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic costs 
this accounting provides reasonable financial statements but does not always take inflation into consideration 
as rate recovery is based on these historical costs and known and measurable changes  the company is able to receive some rate relief for inflation 
it does not receive immediate rate recovery relating to fixed costs associated with company assets 
such fixed costs are recovered based on historic figures 
any effects of inflation on plant costs are generally offset by the fact that these assets are financed through long term debt 
management and organizational changes in  in response to changes in the electric utility industry  we initiated work to reduce our non power supply costs and position the company as a distribution company with potential to grow 
through an early retirement incentive option and voluntary severance packages offered in  we reduced the core workforce by percent 
the cost associated with this workforce change was approximately million pretax in  but is expected to result in significant future cost savings 
we expensed million of these costs  and received an accounting order from the vpsb allowing us to defer the remaining million expended in  which we plan to seek and expect to receive recovery of in our current or future rate proceedings 
concurrently  three of the senior management team left the company on december   thereby reducing the executive ranks by percent 
the officers were richard b 
hieber  senior vice president and chief operating officer  edwin m 
norse  vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer  and robert c 
young  assistant vice president  customer operations 
on november   nancy r
