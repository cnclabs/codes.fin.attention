the results reflect continued significant portfolio growth  lower commercial credit losses and further improvements in operating efficiency 
the improvements in over resulted from stronger revenues from a higher level of financing and leasing assets and the special items described below

net finance income we earn finance income on the loans and leases we provide to our borrowers and equipment users 
the interest expense is the cost to us of borrowing funds used to make loans and purchase equipment to lease to customers 
the excess of finance income over interest expense is net margin or net finance income 
growing net finance income is a key to increasing our earnings and profitability

years ended december  dollars in millions factoring commissions fees and other income gains on sales of leasing equipment gains on securitizations gains on sales of venture capital investments the increase reflects higher fees from servicing and commercial businesses and improved gains on the sale of equipment coming off lease 
we realized in excess of of equipment residual book value in  and these increases were offset by sharply lower gains on reduced securitization activity 
our fees and other income increased in from primarily due to higher factoring commissions and gains from higher levels of securitization activity  offset by lower gains on the sale of equipment coming off lease 
gain on sale of equity interest acquired in loan workout we originated a loan in the s to a telecommunications company that subsequently went into default

ama is comprised of average earning assets plus the average of consumer finance receivables previously securitized and currently managed by us 
these ratios  excluding the non recurring pretax gain and expenses previously described  are set forth in the following table 
years ended december  efficiency ratio salaries and general operating expenses as a percentage of ama the improvement in the ratios reflects our continuing focus on cost containment and ability to leverage our existing operating structure and investments in technology 
we manage expenditures using a comprehensive budgetary process

to ensure overall project cost control  an approval and review procedure is in place for major capital expenditures  such as purchases of computer equipment  including post implementation evaluations 
reserve and provision for credit losses credit quality our consolidated reserve for credit losses increased to million of finance receivables at december   from million of finance receivables at december   and from million of finance receivables at december  these increases primarily reflect growth in finance receivables in each year 
the relationship of the consolidated reserve for credit losses to nonaccrual finance receivables was for  for  and for another measure of reserve adequacy and strength used by us and in our industry is the ratio of the balance sheet reserve for credit losses to trailing twelve month net credit losses recent credit loss experience 
this ratio improved to times at december   from times at december  and times at december  our consolidated reserve for credit losses is periodically reviewed for adequacy considering economic conditions  collateral values and credit quality indicators  including charge off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets 
it is management s judgment that the consolidated reserve for credit losses is adequate to provide for potential credit losses 
we review finance receivables periodically to determine the probability of loss  and take charge offs after considering such factors as the obligor s financial condition and the value of underlying collateral and guarantees 
automatic charge offs are recorded on consumer finance receivables at intervals beginning at days of contractual delinquency  based upon historical loss severity  with charge offs finalized upon disposition of the foreclosed property 
the consolidated reserve for credit losses is intended to provide for future events  which by their nature are uncertain 
therefore  changes in economic conditions or other events affecting specific obligors or industries may necessitate additions or deductions to the consolidated reserve for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses was million for  million for  and million for net credit losses were million for  million for  and million for our net credit loss experience is provided in the following table

risk management our business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of risk to be credit risk including credit  collateral and equipment risk and asset liability risk including interest rate and liquidity risk 
we consider the management of risk essential to conducting our commercial and consumer businesses and to maintaining profitability 
accordingly  our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
credit risk management we have developed systems specifically designed to manage credit risk in our commercial and consumer business segments 
we evaluate financing and leasing assets for credit and collateral risk during the credit granting process and periodically after the advancement of funds 
our executive credit committee ecc delegates credit authority to each of our strategic business units 
the ecc is comprised of members of senior management  including the chief executive officer  vice chairman  executive vice president credit administration  senior executive vice president and executive vice president multi national marketing group 
generally  members of the ecc must approve all transactions above the strategic business units credit authority and all transactions outside of certain established target market definitions and risk acceptance criteria 
each of our strategic business units has developed and implemented a formal credit management process in accordance with formal uniform guidelines established by the ecc 
these ecc guidelines set forth risk acceptance criteria for o acceptable maximum credit line  o selected target markets and products  o creditworthiness of borrowers  including credit history  financial condition  adequacy of cash flow and quality of management  and o the type and value of underlying collateral and guarantees including recourse from dealers and manufacturers 
we also employ a risk adjusted pricing process where the perceived credit risk is a factor in determining the interest rate and or fees charged for our financing and leasing products 
as economic and market conditions change  credit risk management practices are reviewed and modified  if necessary  to seek to minimize the risk of credit loss 
compliance with established corporate policies and procedures and the credit management processes at each strategic business unit are reviewed by the credit audit group of our internal audit department 
the credit audit group examines adherence with established credit policies and procedures and tests for inappropriate credit practices  including whether potential problem accounts are being detected and reported on a timely basis 
the general auditor  who oversees the credit audit group  reports to the chief executive officer of cit and to the audit committee 
commercial 
we have developed systems specifically designed to effectively manage credit risk in our two commercial segments 
the process starts with the initial evaluation of credit risk and underlying collateral at the time of origination and continues over the life of the finance receivable or operating lease  including collecting past due balances and liquidating underlying collateral 
credit personnel of the applicable strategic business unit review each potential borrower s financial condition  results of operations  management  industry  customer base  operations  collateral and other data  such as third party credit reports  to thoroughly evaluate the customer s borrowing and repayment ability 
borrowers are graded according to credit quality based upon our uniform credit grading system  which grades both the borrower s financial condition and the underlying collateral 
credit facilities are subject to approval within our overall credit approval and underwriting guidelines and are issued commensurate with the credit evaluation performed on each borrower 
we review and monitor credit exposures on an ongoing basis to identify  as early as possible  those customers that may be experiencing declining creditworthiness or financial difficulty 
we periodically evaluate our commercial segments finance receivables based upon credit criteria developed under our uniform credit grading system 
we monitor concentrations by borrower  industry  geographic region and equipment type and management adjusts limits as conditions warrant to seek to minimize the risk of credit loss 
our asset quality review committee is comprised of members of senior management  including the vice chairman  the executive vice president credit administration and the chief financial officer 
periodically  the committee will meet with the president and ceo of cit to review  among other topics  levels of geographic  industry and customer concentrations 
in addition  the committee periodically meets with senior executives of our strategic business units  and reviews the status of financing and leasing assets greater than  to obligors with higher risk profiles 
consumer 
for consumer loans  our management has developed and implemented proprietary automated credit scoring models for each loan type eg  recreation vehicles  manufactured housing  recreational boat and home equity that include both customer demographics and credit bureau characteristics 
the profiles emphasize  among other things  occupancy status  length of residence  length of employment  debt to income ratio ratio of total installment debt and housing expenses to gross monthly income  bank account references  credit bureau information and combined loan to value ratio 
the models are used to assess a potential borrower s credit standing and repayment ability considering the value or adequacy of property offered as collateral 
our credit criteria includes reliance on credit scores  including those based upon both our proprietary internal credit scoring model and external credit bureau scoring  combined with judgment 
the credit scoring models are regularly reviewed for effectiveness utilizing statistical tools 
we regularly evaluate the consumer loan portfolio using past due  vintage curve and other statistical tools to analyze trends and credit performance by loan type  including analysis of specific credit characteristics and other selected subsets of the portfolios 
adjustments to credit scorecards and lending programs are made when deemed appropriate 
individual underwriters are assigned credit authority based upon their experience  performance and understanding of the underwriting policies and procedures of our consumer operations and a credit approval hierarchy exists to ensure that all applications are reviewed by an underwriter with the appropriate level of authority

asset liability management management strives to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and optimize net finance income under formal policies established and monitored by the capital committee 
the capital committee is comprised of members of senior management  including the chief executive officer  the vice chairman  and the chief financial officer 
three members of the capital committee are also members of our board of directors 
the capital committee establishes and regularly reviews interest rate sensitivity  funding needs  liquidity  and asset pricing to determine short term and long term funding strategies  including the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
we use off balance sheet derivatives for hedging purposes only  and do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to ensure both appropriate use as a hedge and hedge accounting treatment  all derivatives entered into are designated  according to the applicable hedge objective  against commercial paper  a specifically underwritten debt issue  or a specific pool of assets 
our primary hedge objectives include the conversion of variable rate liabilities to fixed rates  the conversion of fixed rate liabilities to variable rates  the fixing of spreads on variable rate liabilities to various market indices and the elimination of interest rate risk on finance receivables classified as held for sale prior to securitization 
we manage our derivative positions so that the exposure to interest rate  credit or foreign exchange risk is in accordance with the overall operating goals established by our capital committee 
there is an approved  diversified list of creditworthy counterparties used for derivative financial instruments  each of whom has specific credit exposure limits  which are based on market value 
the executive credit committee approves each counterparty and its related market value and credit exposure limit annually  or more frequently if any changes are recommended 
credit exposures for each counterparty are measured based upon market value of the outstanding derivative instruments 
market values are calculated periodically for each swap contract  summarized by counterparty and reported to the capital committee
