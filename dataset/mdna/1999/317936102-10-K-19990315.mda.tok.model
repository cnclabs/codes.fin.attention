item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the company is a financial services organization principally engaged in mortgage loan origination  purchases  sales and servicing 
loans originated by the company primarily consist of fixed and adjustable rate loans secured by first mortgages on single family residences 
the company originates loans through its retail branch network which is currently comprised of offices in the united states eight of which are located in california  four of which are located in new york  three of which are located in ohio  two of which are located in each of illinois  maryland  new jersey and pennsylvania  and one of which is located in each of arizona  colorado  florida  georgia  minnesota  oregon  utah  virginia and washington 
in addition  the company purchases loans from qualified mortgage originators 
the company either securitizes the loans in a trust or sells the loans to wholesale purchasers 
a significant portion of the company s loan production is securitized with the company retaining the right to service the loans 
in october  the board of directors authorized a three for two split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock dividend was distributed on october  all share and per share information have been restated to reflect the stock dividend 
during the third quarter of  faco completed an initial public offering the ipo whereby  shares of its class a common stock were sold to the public 
concurrently   shares of the class b common stock of faco were issued in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of famco as part of a reorganization whereby famco became a wholly owned subsidiary of faco 
by july  all issued and outstanding class b common stock of faco was converted on a one for one basis to class a common stock 
the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for periods prior to the date of the reorganization and ipo substantially consist of those of famco 
prior to  the company sold its loans to private investors on a servicing retained basis 
since that time  the company has sold the majority of its loans in the secondary market primarily through securitization and  to a lesser extent  through whole loan sales in which the company does not retain the right to service the loans 
the company s underwriting guidelines require threshold credit criteria and combined ltv limits for loans sold through securitizations 
accordingly  the company sells on a servicing released basis those loans which do not meet its risk criteria for securitization 
the company retains the right to service loans which it has securitized 
the company s strategy of originating  as compared to purchasing  the majority of its loan volume results in the generation of a significant amount of loan origination fees 
this income has allowed the company to generate positive operating cash flow 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s operating cash flow will continue to be positive in the future 
certain accounting considerations as a fundamental part of its business and financing strategy  the company securitizes the majority of its loans in trusts whereby the loans are exchanged for regular and residual interests in the trusts 
a significant portion of the company s income is associated with securitization activity 
gains on servicing released whole loan sales equal the difference between the net proceeds to the company from such sales and the loans acquisition cost for purchased loans or net carrying value for originated loans 
the net carrying value of originated loans is equal to their principal balance less net deferred origination fees 
gains on servicing retained sales of loans through securitization represent the difference between the net proceeds to the company in the securitization and the allocated cost of loans securitized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the allocated cost of the loans securitized is determined by allocating their acquisition cost for purchased loans or net carrying value for originated loans between the loans securitized  the residual interests and the mortgage servicing rights retained by the company based upon their relative fair values 
at origination  the company classifies the residual interests as trading securities  which are recorded at fair value 
the difference between the fair value of residual interest certificates and their allocated cost is recorded as gain on securitization and is included in loan origination and sale revenue 
in a securitization  the company exchanges loans for regular interest certificates and a residual interest certificates in a trust 
the regular interest certificates are immediately sold by the company to the public for cash 
as the holder of the residual interest certificates  the company is entitled to receive certain excess cash flows 
these excess cash flows are the difference between a principal and interest paid by borrowers and b the sum of i scheduled principal and interest paid to holders of the regular interest certificates  ii trustee fees  iii third party credit enhancement fees  iv servicing fees  and v loan losses 
the company begins receiving these excess cash flows after certain overcollateralization requirements  which are specific to each securitization and are used as a means of credit enhancement  have been met 
the company records residual interest certificates at fair value 
as such  the carrying value of these securities is impacted by changes in market interest rates and prepayment and loss experiences of these and similar securities 
the company determines the fair value of the residual interest certificates utilizing prepayment  credit loss and other assumptions appropriate for each particular securitization consistent with those an unrelated third party would utilize to value such securities 
to the company s knowledge  there is no active market for the sale of these residual interest certificates 
the range of values attributable to the factors used in determining fair value is broad 
accordingly  the company s estimate of fair value is inherently subjective 
prepayments are expressed through a market convention known as an annual constant prepayment rate cpr 
see note of the audited financial statements for the residual interest assumptions utilized by the company during and as of december   the company s investments in residual interests totaled million 
to determine the fair value of mortgage servicing rights  the company computes the present value of projected net cash flows expected to be received over the life of the loans 
such projections incorporate assumptions  including servicing costs  prepayment rates and discount rates  consistent with those an unrelated third party would utilize to value such mortgage servicing rights 
these assumptions are similar to those used by the company to value residual interests 
the company periodically evaluates capitalized mortgage servicing rights for impairment  which is measured as the excess of unamortized cost over fair value 
this review is performed on a disaggregated basis by loan type 
the company has generally found that non conforming borrowers are payment sensitive rather than interest rate sensitive 
therefore  the company does not consider interest rates a predominant risk characteristic for purposes of evaluating impairment 
as of december   mortgage servicing rights totaled million 
the three primary components of the company s revenue are loan origination and sale  loan servicing and other fees and interest and other income 
loan origination and sale revenue consists of gain on sale of loans and the recognition of net deferred origination fees 
a significant portion of loan origination and sale revenue is the recognition upon sale of net deferred origination fees  which equaled million  or of loan origination and sale revenue  during loan servicing and other fees represent management servicing fees and other ancillary fees  including prepayment penalties  received from servicing loans 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized against loan servicing and other fee revenue over the period of estimated net future servicing fee income 
interest and other income is primarily comprised of three components i interest on loans held for sale during the warehousing period and loans receivable held for investment  ii interest on residual interests  and iii income derived from the company s credit card operations

total revenues decreased or million in and increased or million in the decrease in was primarily due to lower loan origination and sale revenue and loan servicing and other fees  which was offset by increased interest and other income 
the increase in  however  was primarily due to higher loan origination and sales revenue and interest income 
loan origination and sale revenue decreased or million in and increased or million in gain on sale of loans decreased million or in as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a million write down of residual interest  and a reduction of gain on sale related to whole loan sales and securitizations of approximately million 
additionally  during the company recognized as gain approximately million related to an increase in the fair value of residual interest 
the write down during was the result of an increase in the company s prepayment rates primarily related to its adjustable rate loans 
in addition  gain on sale as a percent of loans sold decreased to in from in gain on sale related to whole loan sales decreased by million during as compared to gain on sale as a percent of whole loan sales decreased to during from in resulting from a reduction in premiums available in the secondary market for the company s loans 
gain on sale related to securitizations decreased million during as compared to gain on sale as a percent of securitized loans decreased to during from during such was primarily the result of increased prepayment rates experienced by the company during consequently  the company increased the weighted average constant prepayment rate assumption for its adjustable rate loans from during to during gain on sale of loans increased million in as compared to due to a increase in the volume of loans sold  an increase in gain on sale as a percent of loans sold and million recognized in as an increase in the fair value of residual interest certificates 
gain on sale as a percentage of loans sold increased to in from in gain on sale as a percent of loans securitized increased to in from in this increase is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average initial interest rate spread and a decrease in the discount rate used in computing the fair value of the residual interest certificates and mortgage servicing rights 
the weighted average initial interest rate spread the difference between the initial weighted average loan interest rates for the loans included in the securitization and the initial weighted average pass through rate paid to the holders of the regular interest certificates in the securitization in residual interest certificates originated increased to in from in a discount rate of was used to value residual interest certificates and mortgage servicing rights in as compared to a rate of used in in addition  the weighted average gain on whole loan sales increased to of loans sold in as compared to in  due primarily to increased premiums available in the secondary market 
despite a increase in retail loan sales during  net loan origination and other fees remained consistent with the levels 
net loan origination and other fees did not increase in the same proportion as the increase in retail loan sales primarily due to a decrease in the average gross fees recognized from during to during the increase of million in net loan origination and other fees in as compared to is the direct result of a increase in retail loan sales during loan servicing and other fees decreased million or in and million or in the decrease in both years was primarily attributable to an increase in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased by million and million in and  respectively 
the increase during and was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of mortgage servicing rights outstanding as compared to the prior years 
additionally  during  the company accelerated the amortization of mortgage servicing rights by approximately million as a result of higher than expected prepayments 
excluding amortization of mortgage servicing rights  loan servicing and other fees during and remained consistent with the prior year despite an increase in the average servicing portfolio 
this can primarily be attributed to the composition of the company s servicing portfolio when compared to the prior years 
the company earns higher management servicing fees on loans serviced for private investors and for securitizations consummated prior to as the proportion of loans serviced for this group of loans decreases in relation to the portfolio balance  so does the related servicing income 
interest and other income increased million or in as compared to this increase was primarily related to a million increase in interest derived from loans held for sale and loans receivable held for investment and a million increase in other income from the company s credit card operations  which commenced operation in the fourth quarter of such increases were offset by a million decrease in interest income from residual interest certificates 
the increase in interest from loans held for sale was a direct result of an increase in the average balance of loans held for sale when compared to the prior year  primarily due to a growing united kingdom portfolio 
interest income increased million  or  in as compared to the increase in interest income was due to a million increase in interest income from loans held for sale  a million increase in interest income from residual interest certificates  and a million increase in interest income from short term investments 
the increases in interest income from loans held for sale and residual interest certificates were primarily due to increases in the average balances of loans held for sale and residual interest certificates during as compared to the increases in interest income from short term investments were primarily attributable in increases in the balance of available cash as a result of the ipo and cash generated from operations

interest expense increased or million in as compared to primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the company s warehouse financing facility 
this increase was the result of a increase in the average balance of loans warehoused in as compared to additionally  the weighted average interest rate on the warehouse financing facility increased in the increase in the weighted average interest rate is due to an increase in the proportion of united kingdom loans  which carry a higher cost of funds  warehoused during as compared to interest expense increased million in as compared to due primarily to an increase in interest expense on the warehouse financing facility of million 
the increase in interest expense on the warehouse financing facility is the result of a increase in the average balance outstanding on the warehouse line when compared to the prior year 
in addition  during  the company paid interest on s distribution notes of million 
no such notes were outstanding during legal expense increased or million in as compared to as a result of increased litigation and costs related to the discontinuation of the united kingdom origination operations 
legal expense increased million in as compared to primarily due to legal costs incurred in resolving outstanding corporate litigation matters 
income taxes from may  until the close of the ipo  the company had elected to be treated for federal income and certain state tax purposes as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and comparable state laws 
as a result  the company s provisions for income taxes during that period reflected modest corporate level state income taxes for those states in which the company operates 
the taxable income of the company during such periods has been included in the individual taxable income of its stockholders for federal and state income tax purposes 
the company s s corporation status was terminated in july and the company became subject to full corporate federal income and certain state income taxes 
in conjunction with the termination of the company s s corporation status  the company recorded million of net deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities measured by applying enacted tax rates and law to taxable years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
since the ipo  the company s effective income tax rate has approximated the federal and composite state income tax rates net of federal benefit 
if the company had been fully subject to federal and state income taxes  net income on a pro forma basis would have been million in the company s actual tax rates for and were and  respectively 
during the first two quarters of  the company began securitizing its loans in the form of owners trusts 
by utilizing this securitization structure  the company s securitization of loans were treated as a borrowing for state and federal tax purposes rather than as a sale 
in the third and fourth quarters of  however  the company decided to securitize its loans in the form of a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic  under which the securitization of loans will be treated as a sale for state and federal tax purposes

average servicing portfolio balance equals the quarterly average of the servicing portfolio computed as the average of the balance at the beginning and end of each quarter 
net losses represent losses realized with respect to disposition of reo 
the increase in loan losses in was principally due to disposition of properties acquired through foreclosures of wholesale loans purchased in and from certain originators from which the company no longer purchases loans 
liquidity and capital resources as a fundamental part of its business and financial strategy  the company securitizes the majority of its loans  whereby the company deposits into a trust certain loans originated or acquired by the company in exchange for i debt instruments backed by the loans in the trust  and ii a residual interest in the trust 
the company then sells the debt instruments to the public 
a significant portion of the company s revenues  income and cash flow is generated through these securitizations 
conditions in the securitization market have deteriorated in recent months as lenders in the sub prime sector have suffered a significant loss of liquidity 
as a result  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to continue to access the securitization market on the same terms as previously experienced 
any substantial reduction in the availability of the securitization market for the company s loans or any substantial deterioration in the terms to the company of any securitization  would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial conditions 
the company s ability to continue to originate and purchase loans is dependent upon adequate credit facilities and upon its ability to sell loans in the secondary market in order to generate cash proceeds for new originations and purchases 
the value of and market for the company s loans are dependent upon a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates and governmental regulations 
the current market environment described above has adversely affected the company s ability to maintain its current sources of financing or to obtain new sources of financing at favorable terms 
these factors have also adversely affected the company s ability to complete securitizations on the same terms as previously experienced in recent periods 
the company s inability to complete a securitization in a calendar quarter will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
a prolonged duration of the current market environment is likely to adversely affect the company s ability to make or purchase loans and its ability to sell loans in the secondary market  with a consequent adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
during the fourth quarter of  the company s million  million and pound million warehouse financing facilities expired  and were not renewed 
in december  the company entered into a million warehouse financing facility and a secured term loan facility of approximately million 
the million warehouse financing facility is secured by loans originated or purchased by the company  expires in december  and bears interest at a rate ranging between to over one month united states dollar denominated london interbank offered rate libor 
as partial consideration for the million warehouse financing facility  the company agreed to grant the warehouse lender stock warrants that may be exercised by the lender to purchase one percent of the company s common stock on a diluted basis  with an effective date in february the million secured term loan facility  which was entered into with a company owned by the majority stockholders of faco  brian and sarah chisick  and is secured by united kingdom mortgages held for investment  bears a fixed interest rate of  and matures as the underlying pledged mortgages are liquidated 
these facilities contain certain affirmative and negative covenants with which the company was in compliance at december  although management expects that the company will be able to maintain these warehouse financing facilities  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
the company is therefore continuing to pursue other warehouse financing facility arrangements 
to the extent that the company is not successful in maintaining or replacing the existing financing arrangements  the company may be forced to curtail its loan production activity  which may lead to significantly reduced loan sales  thereby having a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
historically  the company has generated positive cash flow 
the company s sources of cash include loan sales  sales of regular interests  borrowings under its warehouse financing facilities  distributions received from residual interests  interest income and loan servicing income 
the company s usage of cash includes the funding of loan originations and purchases  payments of interest  repayment of its warehouse financing facilities  capital expenditures  operating and administrative expenses and payment of income taxes 
the loan origination and processing fees charged to the borrower are included in the principal balance of the loan originated 
the company funds such loans out of available cash or through its warehouse financing facilities 
for loans financed through available cash  the company receives its loan origination and processing fees in cash upon sale of the loan 
for loans financed through the warehouse financing facilities  the company generally receives substantially all of the loan origination and processing fees in cash at the time of the warehouse financing facility borrowing 
during the third quarter of  the company completed the ipo whereby  shares of class a common stock were sold resulting in gross proceeds of million 
after deducting underwriting discounts and costs of the ipo  the net proceeds of million were used to pay million of s distribution notes  to pay down million of the company s warehouse financing facilities and to fund current operations 
prior to the ipo  the company paid dividends  including amounts to be used by the stockholders for the payment of personal income tax on the earnings of the s corporation 
in this regard  the company paid dividends of million in in addition  in  the company distributed s distribution notes to the stockholders of the company totaling million 
proceeds from the ipo were used to pay the s distribution notes in since the completion of the ipo in july the company has been taxed as a c corporation and no cash dividends have been declared 
in february  the company entered into master repurchase agreements to provide warehouse financing facilities to two mortgage banking companies borrowers that are controlled by related parties 
during  subsequent to receiving full repayment on the outstanding warehouse financing facilities  the company terminated the arrangement with the borrowers 
in april  the board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which the company was authorized to purchase up to million shares of its class a common stock 
in january and july  the board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional million shares and million shares of class a common stock  respectively 
of the million shares authorized  the company had repurchased approximately million shares as of december  as of december   the company had commitments to fund loans of million 
historically  approximately of such commitments have ultimately been funded 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  the company purchased an office building for million to house the company s telemarketing operations 
the company is currently negotiating to refinance its  square foot office building in irvine  california  and expects to receive proceeds of approximately million in the first quarter of in connection with this refinancing 
there can be no assurance  however  that this refinancing will be achieved 
the company believes that cash flows from operations  net proceeds from securitizations and whole loan sales and the availability of funds under the warehouse financing facilities will be sufficient to fund operating needs and capital expenditures for the ensuing months 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s internal use computer programs and hardware  as well as its software  that are date sensitive may recognize a date using the two digits as the year rather than the year failure to correct the year problem could result in miscalculation of data  causing a disruption of operations including  among other things  an inability to process loan transactions  service its loan portfolio or engage in other normal business activities 
such failure could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company has implemented a formal five step plan in order to address the year issue awareness  inventory  assessment  renovation  and testing and implementation 
the plan addresses hardware and software purchased or leased from outside vendors  in house developed software  telecommunication equipment and facilities 
the first four steps of the plan have been completed and  thus far  the company has been required to replace or renovate only a small amount of older computer equipment to comply with the year issue 
the company expects to complete the last step of the plan by the second quarter of because the majority of the company s computer software and hardware has been purchased or developed recently and was designed to be year compliant  the company does not expect its costs to be material in addressing the year issue 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant outside vendors to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable in the event that those parties fail to properly address their own year issue 
while the company is not presently aware of any significant exposure  there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties on which the company relies will be converted in a timely manner 
a contingency plan for outside vendors has not yet been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  and such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
the company expects to complete its analysis and contingency plan by june  effects of recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
