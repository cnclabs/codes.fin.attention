item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company the following discussion and analysis encompasses energysouth  inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries collectively referred to as the company 
energysouth became the holding company for mobile gas service corporation mobile gas on february   and at that time mobile gas became a wholly owned subsidiary 
the company  primarily through mobile gas  is engaged principally in the distribution of natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers in southwest alabama 
other company subsidiaries are engaged in providing gas pipeline transportation  gas storage  gas marketing and other energy related services 
the alabama public service commission apsc regulates the company s gas distribution and storage operations 
mobile gas rate tariffs for gas distribution allow a pass through to customers of the cost of gas supplies  certain taxes  and incremental costs associated with the replacement of cast iron mains 
these costs  therefore  have little impact on the company s earnings 
other costs  including a return on investment  are recovered through rates approved in traditional rate proceedings 
interstate gas storage contracts of bay gas storage company  ltd 
bay gas do not require apsc approval since the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  which has jurisdiction over such contracts  allows them to have market based rates 
market based rates minimize regulatory involvement in the setting of rates for storage services and allow bay gas to respond to market conditions 
the ferc issued an order on april  granting authority to bay gas to provide transportation only services to interstate and intrastate shippers and approved rates for such service 
the company s distribution business is highly seasonal and temperature sensitive since residential and commercial customers use more gas during colder weather for heating 
as a result  the company s operating results in any given period historically have reflected  in addition to other matters  the impact of weather  through either increased or decreased sales volumes 
the company utilizes a temperature rate adjustment rider to mitigate the impact that unusually cold or warm weather has on customer billings and operating margins by reducing high gas bills in colder than normal weather and increasing gas revenues in warmer than normal weather 
normal weather for the company s service territory is defined as the year average temperature as determined by the national weather service 
in the gas utility industry  heating degree days are the benchmark for measuring coldness and represent the number of degrees that the daily average temperature falls below degrees fahrenheit 
results of operations net income net income before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the fiscal years ended september   and was  or per share   or per share and  or per share  respectively 
all references to earnings per share amounts are computed on a diluted basis 
during fiscal the company changed its accounting for unbilled revenues to be consistent with prevailing industry practice and changed its accounting for start up costs to comply with new accounting standards 
in accordance with accounting rules  the amounts presented for and have not been adjusted 
both accounting changes are discussed in further detail within note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cumulative effect on prior years of the accounting changes  reported as a separate component of net income  decreased net income  per share 
certain operating income components of current year net income were impacted as a result of the accounting changes increasing net income  per share 
assuming retroactive application of the accounting changes  earnings per share amounts for fiscal  and would have been  and  respectively 
the increase in pro forma earnings for compared to is due primarily to increased revenues from gas storage operations  decreased operations expenses and decreased interest expense 
the increase in earnings for compared to is due primarily to increased margin on gas transportation revenues and decreased operations expenses 
operating revenues gas revenues decreased  in compared to included within gas revenues for is the effect of accruing for unbilled gas revenues at month end while no such accrual is included within and since this new accounting method was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal the effect on gas revenues of the accounting change assuming retroactive application is not materially different from amounts presented within the consolidated statements of income 
gas sales revenues to residential and commercial customers decreased  due primarily to decreased gas sales volumes of resulting from weather in mobile gas service area during the heating season which was warmer than prior year and warmer than normal 
the temperature adjustment rider in rates mitigated the effect on earnings of weather to a large degree  however  margins from customers whose usage is sensitive to weather were down slightly from prior year 
margin is a term used to describe gas revenues less related cost of gas 
revenues from temperature sensitive customers were also lower in compared to due to lower purchased gas costs passed through to customers 
large commercial and industrial gas sales revenues decreased  primarily due to warm weather  reduced rates related to the pass through of gas costs  and several customers changing from sales to transportation agreements 
gas transportation revenues  excluding bay gas  remained flat in compared to revenues from natural gas storage and transportation operations at bay gas increased  in compared to due primarily to transporting gas to a new electric co generation plant that began operations in and providing new storage services to a major electric utility s new gas fired electric generating facilities in the southeast 
bay gas has also contracted to transport gas beginning in to new gas fired electric generators located near the bay gas pipeline 
gas revenues increased  in compared to gas sales revenues to residential and commercial customers increased  due to a increase in volumes resulting from weather which was colder than prior year and colder than normal 
gas sales revenues in from residential and commercial customers did not increase as much as expected considering the cold weather since gas revenues were impacted negatively by a decrease in the customer consumption per heating degree day as compared to the historical average 
the decline in customer usage appears to be attributed to the consistent moderate temperatures experienced throughout the fiscal heating season even though temperatures were colder than normal in terms of degree days 
additional margins from increased sales volumes attributed to colder weather were more than offset by the operation of mobile gas temperature adjustment rider 
large commercial and industrial gas sales revenues decreased  primarily due to several customers changing from sales to transportation agreements while gas transportation revenues increased  as a result of this switch in addition to new transportation customers added to the distribution system 
merchandise sales revenues decreased  in compared to and increased  in compared to the fluctuation for both years is due primarily to record level of appliances sold in other operating revenues is comprised primarily of interest income from the financing of merchandise sales and installations that occur at the company and through trade programs and also includes revenues from non utility jobbing work  engineering consulting  operations training and gas marketing services 
other operating revenues increased  in due primarily to increased gas marketing revenues and increased  in due primarily to increased financing income and gas marketing revenues 
operating expenses cost of gas decreased  in compared to due to decreased gas sales volumes of resulting from weather warmer than the prior year and decreased average cost of gas per therm sold of 
cost of gas increased  in compared to due to increased gas sales volumes of and increased average cost of gas per therm sold of 
the company passes the actual cost of gas on to customers under the purchased gas adjustment provision of rate tariffs 
the difference between actual gas costs and the amount collected from its customers is included as a current asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets and excluded from the consolidated statements of income 
because cost of gas is completely recovered from the company s customers  fluctuations in the cost of gas have no effect on gas margins 
cost of merchandise decreased  in and increased  in due primarily to higher merchandise sales volumes in operations and maintenance expenses decreased  in compared to primarily due to cost control efforts  decreased advertising and sales promotion expenses  and a lower provision for uncollectible gas receivables resulting from decreased outstanding receivables due to the warm weather in operations and maintenance expenses decreased  in compared to primarily due to decreased retirement expenses resulting from a higher return on plan assets  decreased provision for uncollectible financed receivables  and decreased other utility expenses 
increases in depreciation expense in and were due to increased depreciable plant in service 
taxes  other than income taxes other taxes  primarily consist of property taxes and business license taxes that are based on gross revenues and fluctuate accordingly 
other taxes decreased  in compared to due primarily to decreased license taxes resulting from lower revenues 
this impact was offset partially by increased property taxes resulting from the growth of plant in service 
other taxes increased  in compared to during  the alabama department of revenue approved the company s claim for refund of a business license tax that resulted in a reduction in other tax expense of  other income and expenses interest expense decreased  in compared to primarily as a result of decreased outstanding long term debt caused partly by the early redemption of  of first mortgage bonds in october this impact was offset partially by an increase in interest expense on short term debt due to increased average short term debt outstanding during periods of interim financing in interest expense decreased  in compared to as a result of decreased outstanding long term debt 
allowance for borrowed funds used during construction represents the capitalization of interest costs to construction work in progress 
capitalized interest costs decreased slightly in compared to due to lower short term interest rates applied in the computations and lower balances on significant construction projects 
capitalized interest costs decreased  in compared to due to completion in august of a significant construction project to service a large industrial customer 
interest income decreased  in compared to interest income of  associated with income tax refunds was recorded in while there is no such miscellaneous interest income in this impact in was offset partially by increased interest income from short term investments resulting from higher average short term investment balances 
interest income increased  in compared to due to the interest income associated with income tax refunds and increased income from short term investments 
minority interest reflects the minority partners share of pre tax earnings of the bay gas and southern gas transmission company partnerships  of which energysouth  inc subsidiaries hold controlling interests 
income tax expense fluctuates with the changes in income before income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in  and was  and  respectively 
the components of income tax expense are reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation inflation impacts the prices the company must pay for labor and other goods and services required for operation  maintenance and capital improvements 
changes in purchased gas costs are passed through to customers in accordance with the purchased gas adjustment provision of the company s rate schedules 
increases in other utility costs must be recovered through timely filings for rate relief 
gas supply a primary goal of the company is to provide gas at the lowest possible cost while maintaining a reliable long term supply 
to accomplish this goal the company has diversified its gas supply by constructing and purchasing pipelines to access the vast gas reserves in our area  both offshore and onshore 
the company has also contracted with certain of these sources for firm supply 
future minimum payments under third party contracts for firm gas supply  which expire at various dates through the year  are as follows   and  a portion of firm supply requirements is met through the withdrawal of gas from the storage facility owned by bay gas  energysouth s owned partnership 
mobile gas has a gas storage agreement with bay gas to receive storage services for an initial period of years  which began in september with the commencement of commercial operations of the storage facility 
the company s purchased gas adjustment provision in rate schedules filed with the apsc allows the recovery of demand and commodity costs of purchased gas from customers 
should the company s customer base decline due to deregulation or other reasons  resulting in costs related to firm gas supply in excess of requirements  management believes it would be able to take one or more of the following actions as part of the regulatory decision allowing other suppliers to serve current customers  secure the right to allocate firm gas supply costs to the new company supplying gas  reduce some excess gas supply costs through a negotiated settlement with suppliers  flow excess gas supply costs to existing customers through the purchased gas component of customers rates 
environmental the company is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  which have not had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain environmental issues 
liquidity and capital resources the company generally relies on cash generated from operations and on a temporary basis  short term borrowings  to meet working capital requirements and to finance normal capital expenditures 
the company issues debt and equity for longer term financing as needed 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flow from operating activities in is due to an increase in net income  adjusted for non cash components  and the change in operating assets and liabilities which generally reflects the timing differences between years of cash receipts and payments on receivables and payables 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily due to a decrease in deferred tax expense 
financing activities used cash of million and million in and  respectively  and provided cash of million in in october  the company redeemed early  of first mortgage bonds 
changes in short term borrowings represent interim financing 
as of september   and  the company had borrowings on its revolving credit agreement of million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  was related to the purchase of short term federal obligations for shares tax planning purposes 
these investments matured in early october of each year and the proceeds were used to repay the short term debt 
additional funding for working capital and capital requirements was obtained in from issuance of million of first mortgage bonds 
a majority of the funding was used to finance the construction of gas distribution facilities in order to serve a large industrial customer with whom the company has a long term contract to transport gas 
cash used in investing activities reflects the capital intensive nature of the company s business 
during  and  the company used cash for construction of distribution and storage facilities  purchases of equipment and other general improvements of million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures related to the gas storage facility were   and  in  and  respectively  while the remaining portion of capital expenditures for each year primarily reflects gas distribution system improvements and expansion 
the company expects fiscal capital expenditures relating to regular construction activity  equipment purchases and other general improvements to be approximately million 
bay gas is planning to construct an additional salt dome cavern for storing bcf of natural gas with expanded injection and withdrawal facilities 
bay gas expects fiscal costs relating to the additional cavern and facilities to be approximately million 
the expansion of storage facilities is expected to be complete by september and to be funded through the debt and or equity markets 
funds for the company s short term cash needs are expected to come from cash provided by operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
at september   excluding the borrowings under the credit agreement related to the purchase of short term investments for shares tax planning purposes  the company had million available for borrowing on its revolving credit agreement 
management believes it has adequate financial flexibility to meet its expected cash needs in the foreseeable future 
year the company has substantially completed its work to resolve the potential impact of the year on the ability of its computerized information systems to accurately process information that may be date sensitive 
programs that recognize a date using as the year rather than could result in errors or system failures that could ultimately cause the company to interrupt service or become unable to process transactions and could thereby require the company to cease operations pending resolution of the problem 
such an eventuality would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  management has devoted significant attention to identifying year issues and testing its systems for year compliance 
the identification  assessment  remediation and testing of the company s computer systems have been completed 
as a result  the company has made changes to its computer application programs and tested them accordingly 
personal computers which are not year ready have been identified and will be replaced or removed from critical functions before the end of calendar the state of year readiness of hardware and software already evaluated will continue to be monitored throughout to maintain this readiness and to determine that there have been no subsequent changes  exclusions or disclaimers by manufacturers resulting in a loss of year readiness 
mission critical processes have been identified and contingency plans have been developed in an effort to ensure the uninterrupted continuation of customer service 
an inventory and assessment of the company s embedded systems has been completed 
the two systems for which failure of embedded systems would be critical are responsible for monitoring and controlling the distribution of gas through the company s pipeline system and the underground storage facility 
both systems have been replaced with systems that are certified by the vendors to be year compliant 
in addition to the remediation and testing efforts of the company s internal systems  the company has contacted each of its significant vendors to obtain a commitment that they are or will be year compliant 
if such assurances are not forthcoming  or if management believes for any reason that any of its significant vendors will not be year compliant when required  management plans to either contract with other vendors that would be able to provide similar services at similar costs or have plans in place so operations will not be materially affected 
during march  the company s year project was subjected to a third party readiness review for completeness 
the company has responded to the recommendations made by the third party review which includes a limited amount of on going testing of third party software  continued assessment and inquiry of significant vendors and finalizing contingency plans for mission critical processes 
each department within the company has completed a written contingency plan which has been compiled into a comprehensive plan for the company 
a steering committee of the company s executive management has reviewed and will continue to review the year project progress on a regular basis 
as of september   the company had incurred approximately  of remediation costs related to year which was expensed and expects to incur an additional  the company has been utilizing working capital to fund its year compliance program and anticipates that it will continue to do so 
the company s internal costs with respect to the year project have not been separately identified  but management believes that they are immaterial 
through our year project analysis  the system responsible for monitoring and controlling the underground storage facilities was determined not to be year compliant 
the company incurred and capitalized approximately  in fiscal for the replacement system 
the system responsible for monitoring and controlling the distribution of gas through the company s pipeline system was planned and scheduled for replacement as part of the company s normal systems upgrade before the year project was initiated 
the primary reason for replacing this system was to achieve increased efficiency and functionality 
the cost of this replacement has been appropriately capitalized and is excluded from the above year costs 
the company has identified what it believes are the most significant worst case year scenarios which would have a material  adverse impact on the company 
these include the ability to receive gas into our system and deliver gas to customers  the ability to communicate with customers  and the ability to bill and process payment collections on a timely basis 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario associated with the year issues would be the company s inability to continue to receive and distribute gas to its customers without interruption 
in order to address this worst case scenario  the company has developed contingency plans to continue to deliver gas primarily through manual intervention and other procedures should it become necessary to do so 
such procedures include back up power supply for its critical distribution and storage operations  and if necessary  curtailment of supply 
the company s storage capacity would be used to supplement system supply in the event its suppliers are unable to make deliveries 
the company s contingency plans also include measures for communicating with emergency services and alternative methods of communicating with employees stationed at critical locations within the service territory and with employees scheduled to handle potential service calls 
contingency planning  risk mitigation  and testing activities will continue through the year rollover by the company 
the company s goal is that year issues will be addressed in a manner that will prevent such issues from having a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations 
while the company has and will continue to pursue year compliance  there can be no assurance that the company and its vendors will be successful in identifying and addressing all material year issues
