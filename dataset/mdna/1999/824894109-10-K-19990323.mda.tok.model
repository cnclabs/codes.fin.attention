overview shoe pavilion  founded in  is the largest independent off price footwear retailer on the west coast that offers a broad selection of women s and men s designer label and name brand merchandise 
the company was among the first footwear retailers on the west coast to expand the off price concept into the designer and name brand footwear market 
as of january   the company operated retail stores in california  washington and oregon under the trade name shoe pavilion 
the company opened  net of closures  stores in  stores in and three stores in in early  the company entered the los angeles market by assuming the leasehold interests of standard shoes  a los angeles based footwear retailer 
in connection therewith  the company purchased the inventory of standard shoes at of standard shoes cost 
the company subsequently converted nine standard shoes locations to shoe pavilion stores 
the company intends to open approximately to new stores  primarily in its existing markets  close four to five stores and relocate two to three stores in the company s growth in net sales historically has resulted primarily from new store openings  and the company expects that the primary source of future sales growth  if any  will continue to be new store openings 
the company s comparable store sales have fluctuated widely  and the company does not expect that comparable store sales will contribute significantly  if at all  to future growth in net sales 
the company defines comparable stores as those stores that have been open for at least consecutive months 
stores open less than consecutive months are treated as new stores  and stores closed during the period are excluded from comparable store sales 
the company s comparable store sales increased in  in and in and decreased in and in in  the company changed its year end to a week year ending on the saturday nearest to december due to this change  sales for the fourth quarter and year ended january  include two additional days  had these days not been included comparable store sales would have increased for the year ended january  the company believes that the decreases in comparable store sales in and were due  in part  to temporary store closures and business disruptions resulting from the reconfiguration of the company s stores from a traditional retail format to the current self service format 
the company believes that the increase in comparable store sales in was due  in part  to the completion of the reconfiguration of the company s comparable stores 
the company does not anticipate realizing similar increases in subsequent periods  and no assurance can be given as to the company s ability to maintain recent comparable store sales growth 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors affecting financial performance uncertainty of future operating results  fluctuations in comparable store sales 
between late and  the company reconfigured substantially all of its stores from a traditional retail format to the current self service format 
this reconfiguration resulted in increased expenses associated with the conversion and decreased net sales due to the temporary closure of the stores 
the majority of the reconfigurations occurred during and contributed to a loss before income taxes of  in the company acquires merchandise opportunistically to obtain favorable terms and in quantities large enough to support future growth  which results in increased inventory levels at various times throughout the year 
as a result  similar to other off price retailers  the company s inventory turnover rates are typically less than full price retailers 
the company s inventory levels have increased from million at december  to million at january  this increase is due in part to the substantial increase in the number of the company s stores 
to the extent that the company s current or future inventory is comprised of older or obsolescent shoes  the company will be required to mark down the sale price of those shoes  which could have a material adverse effect on operating margins in affected periods 
see factors affecting financial performance inventory and sourcing risk 
prior to its initial public offering in february  shoe pavilion was treated as an s corporation for federal and certain state income tax purposes since august as a result  the company s earnings from august through february  were taxed  with certain exceptions  directly to the company s stockholder rather than to the company 
the company s s corporation status terminated on february   and the company is now subject to state and federal income taxes as a c corporation 
in connection with its conversion to c corporation status  the company recorded a nonrecurring tax benefit of  the pro forma adjustments reflect federal and state income taxes as if the company had not elected s corporation status for income tax purposes

pro forma taxes 
the pro forma taxes on income for were million compared to  for the pro forma effective tax rate for was compared to for inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have such an effect in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources the company had million in working capital as of january   compared to million as of december  the company s capital requirements relate primarily to merchandise inventory and leasehold improvements 
the company s working capital needs are typically higher in the second and third quarters as a result of increased inventory purchases for spring and fall selling seasons 
historically  the company has funded its cash requirements primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit facility  and beginning in february  proceeds from its initial public offering 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and  for   and  respectively 
net cash provided by used in operating activities historically has been driven primarily by net income and fluctuations in inventory and accounts payable 
inventory levels have increased throughout these periods due to a net increase in the number of stores 
during  the company experienced delays in the timing of opening certain new stores 
while these delays were largely caused by factors outside the company s control  they shifted the timing of the revenue contribution of certain new stores to a later quarter from the one that was planned 
during  the company anticipates that cash will be used primarily for merchandise inventory and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million  million and  in  and  respectively 
expenditures for were primarily for the build out of new stores  plus work in progress of the company s new management information systems 
expenditures for were primarily for the build out of new stores and the relocation of the company s corporate office and distribution center

during and  the company made distributions to its then sole stockholder of  and  respectively 
upon completion of its initial public offering  the company made an s corporation distribution in the amount of million to its previous sole stockholder  which approximately equaled the estimated earned and previously undistributed taxable s corporation income of the company through the day preceding the termination date of its s corporation status 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during most of  the company had a credit facility agreement  which included a revolving line of credit for million along with a  term line available for the purchase or lease of equipment 
the company paid interest on outstanding amounts at a rate of over the bank s prime rate or libor plus basis points  at the company s option 
during the quarter ended march   million of this line of credit was repaid with the proceeds from the initial public offering 
the balance of this credit facility was paid off in december from borrowings under the company s new credit facility described below 
in december  the company entered into a new a credit facility agreement  which includes a revolving line of credit for million expiring on december  this line of credit is also available for the issuance of commercial and standby letters of credit up to million 
the company pays interest on outstanding amounts at the bank s prime rate or libor plus basis points  at the company s option 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by the company s accounts receivable  general intangibles  inventory and other rights to payment 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants that require  among other things  that a total liabilities may not exceed times tangible net worth  b quarterly net income after taxes and pre tax profit must each not be less than one dollar  c ebitda must not be less than million on a rolling four quarter basis and d the outstanding balance on the line of credit may not exceed times inventory plus the amount available under outstanding letters of credit  and prohibits the declaration and payment of cash or stock dividends 
as of january   the company was in compliance with all covenants and the unused and available portion of the credit facility was approximately million 
as part of its growth strategy  the company plans to pursue opportunities to acquire complementary businesses  although no such transactions are being considered as of the date of this form k 
to the extent that cash resources are insufficient to fund the purchase price of future acquisitions  if any  or the operations of any acquired business  additional external capital may be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
the company expects that anticipated cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the company s new credit facility will satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next months 
the company s capital requirements program may vary significantly from those anticipated depending upon such factors as operating results  the number and timing of new store openings  and the number and size of any future acquisitions 
impact of year the company is currently in the process of addressing a problem that is facing all users of automated information systems 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this situation could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions to operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send payments  or engage in similar normal business activities 
state of readiness 
beginning in early  the company began an overall assessment of its computer systems  including year readiness 
the company determined that certain of its software was not year compliant 
in mid  the company  with the guidance of outside consultants  implemented a plan to replace its existing information systems primarily in response to business demand and growth 
the new systems are designed to replace the company s information systems for order processing  warehousing  finance and point of sale on a fully integrated enterprise wide basis 
these systems will replace existing software that is not year compliant 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to replace and test its information systems software for year compliance 
an executive oversight steering committee  consisting of internal executive management  the company s information systems officer and various outside third parties  has been formed to supervise the replacement  implementation and testing process 
installation of the new systems began in june  and company personnel are currently being trained on the new systems 
the company estimates that the installation of the new systems will be completed by the end of the second quarter of  and testing will be completed thereafter 
the company expects to fully convert to the new  year compliant information systems no later than september  the company has begun communicating with significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to a failure by any of these third parties to remediate their own year issues 
the company s exposure to supplier year business disruptions is reduced because it does not currently communicate electronically with its suppliers 
in addition to suppliers  the company also relies upon governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunication service companies and other service providers outside of the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the company s suppliers  governmental agencies or other third parties will not suffer a year business disruption that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company has not been informed by any supplier of inability to comply with year issues 
costs to address the year issue 
the company has incurred  through january   approximately million relating to the implementation of the new systems and addressing year issues 
the company currently estimates that the total costs for implementing the new systems will approximate million 
included in the costs of implementing the new systems is the cost of equipment which the company presently plans to lease over to months 
the company will capitalize and depreciate the new systems technology over its estimated useful life and to the extent that year costs do not qualify as capital investments  the company will expense such costs as incurred 
the costs of year compliance and the date on which the company believes it will complete the project are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain third party resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  supplier compliance and contingency actions  and similar uncertainties 
the company s total year project costs do not include the estimated costs and time associated with anticipated third party year issues based on presently available information 
risks presented by the year issue 
the company presently believes that with the implementation of new systems and conversion to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
in addition  if any third parties which provide goods or services essential to the company s business activities fail to address appropriately their year issues  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
for example  a year related disruption on the part of the financial institutions which process the company s credit card sales would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
contingency plans 
the company s executive oversight steering committee intends to develop contingency plans in the event that the company has not completed all of its remediation plans in a timely manner or any third parties who provide goods or services essential to the company s business fail to appropriately address their year issues 
the committee expects to conclude the development of these contingency plans by the end of the second quarter of weather and seasonality the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and net income 
historically  net sales and net income have been weakest during the first quarter 
because the company s operations are geographically concentrated  it is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in the regions in which it operates stores  including the san francisco bay area  seattle and los angeles 
if one of these regions were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including timing of new store openings  the level of net sales contributed by new stores  merchandise mix  the timing and level of price markdowns  availability of inventory  store closures  advertising costs  competitive pressures and changes in the demand for off price footwear 
any such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
factors affecting financial performance in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in the shares of common stock of the company 
the statements contained in this form k which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this form k 
risks associated with expansion the company has experienced rapid and substantial growth in net sales as well as in its employee base 
the company s continued growth will depend to a significant degree on its ability to expand its operations through the opening of new stores  to operate these stores on a profitable basis and to increase comparable store sales 
the success of the company s planned expansion will be significantly dependent upon the company s ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms 
in addition  several other factors could affect the company s ability to expand  including the adequacy of the company s capital resources  the ability to hire  train and integrate employees and the ability to adapt the company s distribution and other operational systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that any such expansion will be profitable 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s expansion within its existing markets will not adversely affect the individual financial performance of the company s existing stores or its overall operating results  or that new stores will achieve net sales and profitability levels consistent with existing stores  or at all 
to manage its planned expansion  the company regularly evaluates the adequacy of its existing systems and procedures  including product distribution facilities  store management  financial controls and management information systems 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will anticipate all of the changing demands that expanded operations may impose on such systems 
failure to adapt its distribution capabilities or other internal systems or procedures as required could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company actively monitors individual store performance and has closed underperforming stores in the past  including two each in and  six in and four in the company intends to continue to close underperforming stores in the future  and if it were to close a number of stores  it could incur significant closure costs and reductions in net sales 
in addition  the company may be unable to close certain underperforming stores on a timely basis because of lease terms 
a significant increase in closure costs or the inability to close one or more underperforming stores on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory and sourcing risk the company s future success will be significantly dependent on its ability to obtain merchandise that consumers want to buy  particularly name brand merchandise with long term retail appeal  and to acquire such merchandise under favorable terms and conditions 
in  the company s top ten suppliers accounted for of inventory purchases  of which purchases from intershoe  inc and global sports  inc 
accounted for and of total inventory purchases  respectively 
the deterioration of the company s relationship with any key vendor could result in delivery delays  merchandise shortages or less favorable terms than the company currently enjoys 
the company deals with its suppliers on an order by order basis and has no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing 
as the company s operations expand  its demand for off price inventory will continue to increase 
the company s products typically are manufacturing over runs  over orders  mid or late season deliveries or last season s stock 
the inability of the company to obtain a sufficient supply of readily salable  high margin inventory  to negotiate favorable discount and payment agreements with its suppliers or to sell large inventory purchases without markdowns could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business sourcing and purchasing 
reliance on key personnel the company s future success will be dependent  to a significant extent  on the efforts and abilities of its executive officers  particularly dmitry beinus  the company s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
the company has obtained key man life insurance in the amount of million on mr 
beinus 
the loss of the services of any one of the company s executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s continued growth will depend  in part  on its ability to attract  motivate and retain additional skilled managerial and merchandising personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing personnel or attract additional qualified personnel in the future 
uncertainty of future operating results  fluctuations in comparable store sales although the company recently has been profitable  there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable in the future 
future operating results will depend upon many factors  including general economic conditions  the level of competition and the ability of the company to acquire sufficient inventory  achieve its expansion plans and effectively monitor and control costs 
there can be no assurance that the company s recent gross margin levels will be sustainable in the future 
historically  the company s growth in net sales has resulted primarily from new store openings  and the company expects that the primary source of future sales growth  if any  will continue to be new store openings 
the company s comparable store sales have fluctuated widely  and the company does not expect that comparable store sales will contribute significantly  if at all  to future growth in net sales 
the company defines comparable stores as those stores that have been open for at least consecutive months 
stores open less than consecutive months are treated as new stores  and stores closed during the period are excluded from comparable store sales 
the company s comparable store sales increased in  in and in and decreased in and in the company believes that the decreases in comparable store sales in and were due  in part  to temporary store closures and business disruptions resulting from the reconfiguration of the company s stores from a traditional retail format to the current self service format 
the company believes that the increase in comparable store sales in was due  in part  to the completion of the reconfiguration of the company s comparable stores 
the company does not anticipate realizing similar increases in subsequent periods  and no assurance can be given as to the company s ability to maintain recent comparable store sales growth 
risks associated with possible acquisitions the company may pursue the acquisition of companies and assets that complement its existing business 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  potential adverse short term effects on the company s operating results and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
the company has limited experience in identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
the company does not have any current plans to acquire any other companies  and there can be no assurance that the company will identify attractive acquisition candidates  that acquisitions will be consummated on acceptable terms or that any acquired companies will be integrated successfully into the company s operations 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and net income 
historically  net sales and net income have been weakest during the first quarter 
because the company s operations are geographically concentrated  it is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in the regions in which it operates stores  including the san francisco bay area  seattle and los angeles 
if one of these regions were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including timing of new store openings  the level of net sales contributed by new stores  merchandise mix the timing and level of price markdowns  availability of inventory  store closures  advertising costs  competitive pressures and changes in the demand for off price footwear 
any such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
dependence on consumer spending and preferences the success of the company s operations depends upon a number of factors relating to consumer spending  including employment levels  business conditions  interest rates  inflation and taxation 
there can be no assurance that consumer spending will not decline in response to economic conditions  thereby adversely affecting the company s operating results 
all of the company s products are subject to changing consumer preferences 
consumer preferences could shift to types of footwear other than those that the company currently offers 
any such shift could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s future success will depend  in part  on its ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate effectively or respond to such changes on a timely basis or at all 
failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences could lead to  among other things  lower net sales  excess inventory and lower gross margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
international purchasing the company purchases in season name brand and branded design merchandise directly from factories in italy  brazil and china 
directly sourced goods accounted for approximately and of net sales in and  respectively 
the company has no long term contracts with direct manufacturing sources and competes with other companies for production facilities 
all of the manufacturers with which the company conducts business are located outside of the united states  and the company is subject to the risks generally associated with an import business  including foreign currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements  disruptions or delays in shipments and the risks associated with united states import laws and regulations  including quotas  duties  taxes  tariffs and other restrictions 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not disrupt the company s supply of directly sourced goods or otherwise adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the future 
see item business sourcing and purchasing 
inventory shrinkage the retail industry is subject to theft by customers and employees 
by converting to a self service format  where shoppers have access to both shoes of a pair  the company substantially increased the need for store security 
although the company has implemented enhanced security procedures  there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer from significant inventory shrinkage in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the retail footwear market is highly competitive  and the company expects the level of competition to increase 
the company competes with off price and discount retailers eg  nordstrom rack  payless shoesource  ross dress for less and famous footwear  branded retail outlets eg  nine west  national retail stores eg  nordstrom  marshalls  macy s  sears  eg penney  loehmann s  robinsons may and mervyn s  traditional shoe stores and mass merchants 
many of these competitors have stores in the markets in which the company now operates and in which it plans to expand 
many of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future participants will not enter the off price segment of the footwear market 
competitive pressures resulting from competitors pricing policies could materially adversely affect the company s gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will not face greater competition from other national  regional or local retailers or that the company will be able to compete successfully with existing and new competitors 
the inability of the company to respond to such competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future capital needs the company expects that anticipated cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the company s credit facility will satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  the company may incur significant working capital requirements and capital expenditures in connection with its growth strategy and otherwise 
to the extent that the foregoing cash resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  including new store openings planned for  additional funds will be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to obtain such financing could delay or prevent the company s planned expansion  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible securities  dilution to the company s stockholders could occur 
substantial control by single stockholder dmitry beinus  the company s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
as a result  mr 
beinus is able to decide all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
concentration of stock ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
possible volatility of stock price the common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  which has experienced and is likely to experience in the future significant price and volume fluctuations  either of which could adversely affect the market price of the common stock without regard to the operating performance of the company 
in addition  the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  fluctuations in the company s comparable store sales  announcements by other footwear retailers  the failure of the company s earnings to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  as well as other events or factors 
anti takeover effect of certain charter provisions the board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  and to determine the rights  preferences and restrictions of such shares  without further stockholder approval 
the rights of holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
in addition  certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
such provisions could diminish the opportunities for a stockholder to participate in tender offers  including tender offers at a price above the then current market value of the common stock 
among other things  these provisions i provide that only the board of directors or certain members thereof or officers of the company may call special meetings of the stockholders  ii eliminate the ability of the stockholders to take action without a meeting  and iii authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock having such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board of directors
