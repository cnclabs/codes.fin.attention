while income from operations before special items increased over  it fell short of expectations due primarily to poor refining margins 
special items for were a pre tax million write down to reduce the value of lifo inventories to market  and a million restructuring charge primarily related to the san francisco area refining system 
tosco s marketing division continued to operate well in highly competitive markets 
significant progress was made in integrating the acquired unocal operations 
in february  standard poor s raised tosco s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings 
on february   a fire occurred at a crude unit at the san francisco area refinery  avon facility 
the fire was quickly isolated and extinguished with no offsite impacts or health risks to the community 
on march   tosco announced that the avon refinery would be shutdown for at least days  while a thorough safety review is conducted

compared to tosco earned net income of million per share in compared to million per share in results of operations for include a million million after tax  per share non cash inventory writedown and a million million after tax  per share restructuring charge 
results of operations for include a million million after tax  per share non cash inventory writedown 
sales in were billion compared to billion in this decrease of billion was attributable to lower product prices partially offset by higher refinery throughput and retail fuel sales volumes 
the higher throughput and sales volumes resulted from the products acquisition twelve months in versus nine months in and the full year operation of the previously shutdown trainer refinery  which was reopened on may  operating contribution  as restated to exclude depreciation and amortization  of billion for increased by million over the increase was from refining million partially offset by a decrease from marketing million 
refining operating contribution for increased by million to million due primarily to increased throughput  barrels per day b d in compared to  b d in partially offset by lower operating margin per charge barrel in compared to in 
the increase in throughput volumes was primarily due to the acquisition of the product refineries and the start up of the trainer refinery  and to a lesser degree to increases at the avon and bayway refineries  both of which experienced no unscheduled shutdowns in the decrease in operating margin per charge barrel was primarily due to lower product prices experienced throughout refining operating contribution includes insurance recoveries related to the unscheduled shutdowns in of the bayway refinery cat cracker and avon refinery hydrocracker 
marketing operating contribution for was million compared to million in the decrease of million was due to lower blended fuel margins cents per gallon in versus in partially offset by higher fuel sales volumes from the products acquisition and higher merchandise sales volumes and profit margins 
tosco recorded a million charge for the write down of raw material and product inventories to their fair value at december  the inventory writedown was the result of the steep market decline in crude oil and product prices in lowering the value of inventories acquired in connection with tosco s acquisitions since during  tosco recorded a million inventory write down also as a result of declining prices 
during  tosco recorded a million charge primarily related to the restructuring of its san francisco area refinery system 
the restructuring will result in an increase in the production of clean burning carb phase gasoline and is being made to improve efficiency  reliability  and profitability of the system  without compromising safety or environmental compliance 
the key component of the restructuring plan revolves around the continued integration of the avon refinery and the rodeo santa maria complex acquired in the improved operation will involve the shutdown of several of the less efficient processing units at the avon refinery with resulting staff reductions 
at december   the million charge includes the write down  shutdown  and dismantling costs of certain processing units and facilities that will no longer be used  contract termination costs  and employee severance 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses for include the recognition of a million gain on the sale of the revere distribution terminal in massachusetts  and approximately million of non recurring costs related to the consolidation of tosco s offices 
sg a expenses for include non recurring transition expenses of million related to the integration of the products assets into tosco s operations 
excluding these and non recurring items  sg a expenses increased by million in  due primarily to the products acquisition 
net interest expense  as restated  for was million less than due to lower levels of borrowings and interest rates under the revolving credit facility 
income taxes  including the benefit associated with the distributions on company obligated  mandatorily redeemable  convertible preferred securities trust preferred securities  were million for compared to million in the decrease was due to lower taxable income in compared to tosco earned net income of million per share in compared to million per share in results of operations for include a million million after tax  per share non cash inventory writedown as a result of higher levels of inventories from the products acquisition and the start up of the trainer refinery combined with declining raw material and product prices in late results of operations for include a pre tax charge of million million after tax  per share for the consolidation of the retail marketing division following the acquisition of circle k 
operating contribution sales less cost of sales was billion in compared to billion in  an increase of million million for refining and million for marketing 
operating contribution for and have been restated to exclude depreciation and amortization previously included in cost of sales 
refining operating contribution for increased by million to million due primarily to increased throughput  barrels per day b d in compared to  b d in 
this increase was due to the acquisition of the product refineries and the start up of the trainer refinery  partially offset by reduced throughput at the avon refinery during the first and second quarters and an unscheduled shutdown of the bayway refinery cat cracker in the first quarter 
lower throughput at the avon refinery was due to the scheduled turnaround of the coker unit and the unscheduled hydrocracker shutdown 
the refining operating margin per charge barrel  which fluctuated significantly during the year  averaged  consistent with the average 
refinery operating contribution for includes insurance recovery accruals related to the avon hydrocracker and the bayway cat cracker 
marketing operating contribution for increased by million to million primarily due to the products and circle k acquisitions and higher blended fuel margins 
the volume of fuel sales approximately doubled to billion gallons and the blended fuel margin increased by cents per gallon  despite a higher proportion of dealer jobber sales resulting from the products acquisition 
fuel margins at dealer jobber sites are typically lower than company operated sites 
the increase in blended fuel margins occurred in the fourth quarter due to declining wholesale product prices without a corresponding decline in retail prices 
the retail operating contribution also increased in due to increased merchandise sales billion in compared to billion in with reasonably consistent margins 
depreciation and amortization for was million  a million increase compared to the balance of million 
this increase was primarily due to the products acquisition and the trainer refinery reopening 
sg a expenses were million in compared to million in the increase of million was primarily attributable to the products and circle k acquisitions  including nonrecurring transition expenses of million related to the integration of products into tosco s operations 
incentive compensation also increased in due to higher levels of operating income 
net interest expense for increased by million compared to this increase is primarily due to higher debt levels incurred to finance tosco s expanded operations and acquisitions 
income taxes  including the benefit associated with the distributions on trust preferred securities  were million for compared to million in the increase was due to higher taxable income in the effective income tax rate also reflects the effect of the nondeductibility of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the circle k acquisition 
outlook results of operations are primarily determined by the operating efficiency of the refineries and by refining and retail fuel margins 
on february   a fire occurred at a crude unit at tosco s avon refinery and resulted in four fatalities 
on march   tosco announced that the avon refinery will be shutdown for at least days while a thorough safety review is conducted 
the refinery  including the crude unit  which was not severely damaged  will be brought back up only when safety issues and concerns have been addressed 
the negative impact on the first and second quarter results can not currently be estimated  given the uncertainty of the shut down period 
tosco also accelerated the start of the previously scheduled third quarter turnaround of its fluid catalytic cracking unit at the bayway refinery 
the turnaround should be completed in april except for the avon refinery  whose date of return to service is uncertain  tosco expects  given reasonable margins  to operate its refineries at high levels through the balance of refining margins in early were weak  especially on the east coast 
retail fuel margins in were satisfactory through february but have deteriorated in march 
while refining margins may improve during the balance of  tosco is not able to predict the level or timing of operating margins for the year because of the uncertainties associated with oil markets 
in view of uncertain operating margins and highly competitive markets  tosco is committed to improving its results by lowering costs in all areas of operation without compromising safety  reliability  or environmental compliance 
in february  tosco signed a memorandum of understanding to create a joint venture with union carbide corporation union carbide for the marketing of polypropylene 
a million pounds per year polypropylene plant is planned to be constructed at the bayway refinery over the next two years 
when completed  the joint venture is expected to be one of the top five suppliers of polypropylene in north america 
the production from this new plant and union carbide s plants in seadrift  texas and norco  louisiana  estimated to be billion pounds per year  will be committed to the joint venture and marketed by union carbide 
completion of the joint venture is subject to execution of definitive documents and satisfactory compliance with various conditions 
effective january   tosco will prospectively extend the useful lives of certain refinery and distribution assets in order to better represent the remaining useful lives of the assets  as determined by a third party appraisal 
management estimates that this change in accounting estimate will decrease depreciation and amortization by approximately million 
through march   tosco closed sales for convenience stores for million  plus the cost of inventories 
additionally  tosco expects to divest approximately additional convenience stores during the balance of these stores are located in areas of the united states in which tosco does not have a significant market share 
the sale of these convenience stores is not expected to impact results of operations 
crude oil and finished product prices have significantly fluctuated in recent years and tosco believes this pattern will continue throughout tosco estimates that a per barrel change in raw materials and finished products will have an approximate million impact on its net realizable value reserve of million at december  however  because raw material and finished product prices do not move in unison  the impact on the reserve will vary depending on actual price changes and the mix and level of inventories 
tosco continues to review acquisition opportunities 
however  future acquisitions will occur only at reasonable prices  which are based on realistic earnings in a normalized refining and marketing environment as determined by management 
cash flows as summarized in the consolidated statement of cash flows  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during cash used in investing activities of million and financing activities of million exceeded cash provided by operating activities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities of million was from cash earnings net income plus depreciation and amortization  and other non cash charges and provisions of million  less net increases in operating assets and liabilities primarily working capital and other items of million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million due to net capital additions of million and spending for turnarounds of million less reduction of other long term assets of million 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million due to scheduled and early principal payments on long term debt of million  common stock repurchases of million  dividend payments of million  and other uses of million which exceeded net borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity as measured by cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  deposits  and availability under the revolving credit facility was million at december   which is equal to the december  amount 
an increase in marketable securities and deposits of million was offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents of million and availability under the revolving credit facility of million 
at december   total shareholders equity was billion  a million decrease from december  this decrease was due to the common stock repurchases of million and dividend payments of million exceeding net income of million and other items of million 
debt  including current maturities and the revolving credit facility  decreased by million to billion at december  this decrease was due to scheduled and early payments during partially offset by a million increase in cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the ratio of debt revolving credit facility and non current portion of long term debt to total capitalization revolving credit facility  non current portion of long term debt  trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity was at december   consistent with the december  ratio 
during  tosco adopted a shareholders rights plan 
under the terms of the shareholders rights plan  shareholders received rights to purchase shares of a new preferred stock 
the rights expire on december  and are exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of common stock  a person commenced a tender or exchange offer for more than of common stock  or if an adverse person as defined by the company s board of directors acquires beneficial ownership of or more of common stock 
in january  tosco filed a shelf registration statement providing for the issuance of up to billion aggregate principal amount of debt and equity securities 
such securities may be offered  separately or together  in amounts and at prices and terms to be set forth in one or more supplements to the shelf registration statement 
at december   tosco may issue up to million of securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement 
in order to reduce financing costs  tosco elected to not renew its million facility b under the revolving credit facility which expired on january  the million facility a under the revolving credit facility continues until january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  standard poor s raised tosco s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt rating to triple b from triple b minus 
the upgrade reflects the significant progress tosco has made in integrating its acquisitions into its operations and the announced joint venture with union carbide for the marketing of polypropylene 
the revolving credit facility  as well as funds potentially available from the issuance of securities  provides tosco with adequate resources to meet its expected liquidity demands for at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures during  tosco spent million on budgeted capital and turnaround projects 
refining capital spending totaled million million for property  plant  and equipment and million for turnarounds 
the property  plant  and equipment spending consisted primarily of supporting business growth  improving safety and reliability of operations  and environmental compliance 
retail capital spending of million was primarily focused on enhancing existing sites  integrating operations  and completion of underground storage tank upgrades and replacements 
during january  tosco completed the purchase of approximately convenience stores by paying off the outstanding balance on a real estate installment purchase note  including the settlement of contingent payments  for million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
tosco expects to fund its refinery and retail capital expenditures from cash provided by operations  available credit  and other resources 
refinery capital spending during will continue to consist primarily of supporting business growth  improving safety and reliability of operations  and environmental compliance 
the polypropylene plant is expected to be constructed and financed by a special purpose entity that will lease the plant to tosco under a long term operating lease upon completion 
capital spending for retail operations in will be primarily focused on enhancing existing retail sites 
risk management tosco uses a variety of strategies to reduce commodity price  interest  and operational risks 
tosco  at times and when able  uses futures and forward contracts to lock in what it believes to be favorable margins on a varying portion of refinery production by taking offsetting long obligation to buy at a fixed price positions in crude oil and short obligation to deliver at a fixed price positions in gasoline and heating oil 
this strategy hedges tosco s exposure to fluctuations in refining margins and therefore tends to reduce the volatility of operating results 
in addition  tosco enters into swap contracts with counterparties to hedge sales prices of residual fuels production 
futures and forward contracts are also used to a lesser extent to hedge inventories stored for future sale and to hedge against adverse price movements between the cost of domestic and foreign crude oil 
tosco uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of its derivative instruments 
var represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
tosco estimates var across its derivative instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated using a one day interval 
tosco s measured var  using a var model with a confidence level and assuming normal market conditions at december   was not material 
tosco s calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
the calculated var does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in tosco s holdings of derivative instruments during the year 
tosco manages its interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt 
floating rate debt  primarily borrowings under the revolving credit facility that currently provides up to million of uncollateralized revolving credit availability  is used to finance tosco s working capital requirements 
tosco elected not to renew its million facility b under the revolving credit facility when it expired on january  fixed rate debt consists of million of notes and debentures issued in connection with the products acquisition  million uncollateralized noncallable notes issued in july to repay indebtedness under the previously outstanding collateralized revolving credit facility  million of mortgage bonds issued in and to refinance previously outstanding floating rate bank debt and to finance the acquisition of capital assets including the acquisition of the bayway refinery  and million uncollateralized noncallable notes issued in may to finance a portion of the circle k purchase price 
tosco carries insurance policies on insurable risks  which it believes to be appropriate at commercially reasonable rates 
while tosco believes that it is adequately insured  future losses could exceed insurance policy limits or  under adverse interpretations  be excluded from coverage 
future costs  if any  incurred under such circumstances would have to be paid out of general corporate funds  if available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of tosco s strategy to reduce credit risk 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation has been less significant during the recent years because of the relatively low rates experienced in the united states 
indeed  raw material and petroleum product prices have declined during the last two years 
the deflation in raw material and product prices resulted in write downs of tosco s inventories and reduced profitability during significant periods over the last two years  when product prices fell faster than raw material costs 
the historically low prices for crude oil and products  and low inflation rates generally  are presently forecasted to continue through accordingly  tosco does not expect that inflation will have a significant impact on its operating results 
however  as raw material  energy  and labor are important components of tosco s costs  inflationary increases could have adverse effects on profitability  especially during high inflation periods when raw material and energy cost increases generally lead finished product prices 
impact of the year issue historically  certain computer programs have used two rather than four digits to define a given calendar year 
computer programs that use two digits to define the year may recognize a date using as the year rather than this could result in business and field system failures or miscalculations that could cause serious disruptions of operations 
this is generally referred to as the year issue 
for several years  tosco has been proactively upgrading and replacing its information systems 
during early  tosco formed a year program office to specifically coordinate the efforts of tosco s operating units and administrative departments 
three primary areas related to the year issue are being addressed business systems  field systems  and third parties 
each of these areas is being addressed in five overlapping phases i identifying and assessing critical systems  equipment  and business relationships requiring modification or replacement prior to  ii formulating compliance action plans  iii upgrading  replacing  and or remediating noncompliant systems and equipment  iv testing  and v contingency and business continuation planning 
business systems these include computer systems and applications relating to financial reporting  human resources  purchasing  commercial  supply  pricing  and marketing activities 
tosco has completed the assessment and planning phases related to its critical business systems and substantially completed these phases for its other business systems 
tosco is currently addressing its year issues  primarily through software upgrades and replacements  and remediation of existing systems 
business system testing is also being done on an ongoing and prioritized basis 
we believe these systems will be substantially year ready by june  field systems these include embedded computer chips and computer systems relating to tosco s refining  distribution  and marketing operating assets 
tosco has completed an assessment of the year compliance status of substantially all of its field systems and is currently developing and implementing plans related to the replacement and remediation of noncompliant systems 
tosco expects these plans to be substantially implemented by september  the balance of field system replacements and remediation are expected to be performed during scheduled turnarounds of refinery processing units in the fourth quarter 
field system remediation progress is dependent upon the timely delivery of year compliant third party software and devices 
internal and vendor assisted testing is being done on an ongoing basis as the systems are replaced or remediated 
third party relationships these include tosco s critical suppliers  vendors  customers  financial institutions  utilities  telecommunication providers  governmental entities  and others with whom tosco does significant business collectively third parties 
tosco has initiated two way communications with third parties about their plans and progress in addressing the year issue 
tosco will continue to communicate with and monitor the progress its third parties are making in addressing their year issues 
tosco s ability to accurately assess its third parties year readiness is dependent in large part upon the completeness and reliability of the third parties representations 
contingency plans tosco has formed a year contingency task force the task force which includes representatives from all business segments and other functional responsibilities 
the task force is currently evaluating various business disruption scenarios 
as business disruption scenarios are identified  the task force will evaluate existing contingency plans  formulate new contingency plans as appropriate  and develop preemptive strategies 
additionally  tosco will formulate contingency plans based on the progress its third parties are making in addressing their year issues 
by june   the task force will organize management response teams and formalize these year plans and strategies in conjunction with tosco s existing contingency plans for equipment failures  emergencies  and other business disruptions 
throughout the balance of  the year contingency plans and strategies will be modified as facts and circumstances change 
costs tosco s year compliance costs include external consultants and contractors  compensation costs of internal employees working directly on year issues  purchases of software and hardware  and system upgrades and modifications which were accelerated to address the year issue 
year compliance costs did not have a material effect on tosco s operating results or financial position 
year compliance costs are not expected to have a material effect on tosco s operating results or financial position 
risks tosco believes its business and field systems will be substantially year compliant prior to september  tosco further believes that its critical third party vendors and suppliers are making good progress on their own year remediation efforts 
in the event that tosco is unable to make the necessary system changes on a timely basis  fails to identify all critical year issues  or is unable to implement appropriate contingency plans  such inability could cause significant business disruptions 
additionally  tosco could incur significant business disruptions if one or more of its critical third parties over whom tosco does not have control are not year compliant by december  business disruptions such as production and or distribution shutdowns  out of stock conditions  communication and or energy outages  or billing and or collecting problems could negatively effect tosco s results of operations 
the foregoing year disclosure is based on tosco s current expectations  estimates  and projections  which could ultimately prove to be inaccurate 
because of uncertainties  the actual effect of the year issue on tosco may be different from our current assessment 
new accounting standard during june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
on january  tosco is currently evaluating the effect sfas no 
will have on its financial position and results of operations
