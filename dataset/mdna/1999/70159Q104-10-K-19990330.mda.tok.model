to achieve its objectives  the company borrows at fixed rates but also has a three year million unsecured revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks with chase bank of texas  national association serving as the lead agent the million line and a three year million unsecured line of credit with first american bank  operating as deposit guaranty national bank the million line

in the routine management of its portfolio of office properties  the company evaluates changes in market conditions that indicate an opportunity or need to sell properties within that market in order to maximize shareholder value 
the company also evaluates other factors  including its ability to purchase sufficient property in a market to justify the implementation of self management  the speculative development of new office properties within the market and the demand for office space within the market as evidenced by job growth and office space absorption in deciding whether or not a property should be sold 
as a result of this evaluation  the company is considering selling its property located in birmingham  alabama

funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in march  nareit issued a clarification of the definition of ffo 
the clarification provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets are not to be added back to net income to arrive at ffo 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents the company s ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income   adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization   minority interest depreciation equity in earnings distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries preferred dividends  gain on real estate and mortgage loans   amortization of discounts  deferred gains and other funds from operations   nareit has recommended supplemental disclosure concerning certain capital expenditures  leasing costs and straight line rents as shown below in thousands year ended december straight line rents building improvements  tenant improvements new leases  lease renewals   leasing commissions new leases lease renewals   non core asset improvements leasing commissions amortized upgrades on acquisitions anticipated at the date of purchase   inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to five year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base rent if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
impact of year in august  the company adopted a comprehensive uniform plan to address the issue of year compliance 
the plan addresses problems that might arise in information technology systems  building systems that rely upon date sensitive microprocessors  and third party tenants  manufacturers  vendors and suppliers 
the company s plan is a multi phase process whereby the following steps are taken inventory all company and building systems which could possibly be affected by the year issue  contact the manufacturer of each inventoried system and determine the year compliance status of each  assign priorities based upon the relative importance of each system  anticipate contingencies and develop a comprehensive plan to address issues that arise under various scenarios  identify solutions to identified problems  and test all systems and solutions 
as of december   the inventory of all systems was complete 
additionally  all inventoried systems were prioritized and a significant number of manufacturer  vendor and supplier responses to inquiries had been received 
the testing of all systems is scheduled for the second quarter of  and contingency planning will take place throughout the second  third and fourth quarters of parkway has completed the upgrade of all critical business application services to full year compliance standards 
we have received the necessary updates on all core business applications and are in the process of installing these updates 
we will begin the testing phase of our plan on these servers and their applications during the second quarter of all system workstations have been tested and those that were not compliant will be phased out before the end of the year 
building systems that rely upon date sensitive microprocessors include the hardware  software and associated embedded microprocessors used in the operation of all buildings owned by the company 
testing of these systems is currently in process  and repair  retrofitting or replacement  is being performed as necessary 
internal evaluations and correspondence with equipment manufacturers have revealed that a vast majority of this equipment is not dependent upon the date sensitive microprocessors and will not require alteration to function properly before  during and after the year third party influences on the company s year compliance status include tenants  suppliers and vendors 
all have been contacted regarding their compliance status and their possible impact on the company s operations as a result of the interoperability of applicable systems 
all tenants have been contacted and informed of the company s plan to be compliant 
additionally  inquiries have been forwarded to vendors with whom the company conducts business namely financial institutions and utility firms 
responses to these inquiries are still being received and evaluated to determine appropriate courses of action 
company contingency plans will address these responses  as well as the questions and needs of all tenants 
the cost of the company s year compliance effort is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
estimated total expenditures required to be year compliant are expected to between  and  some portion of which would have been expended irrespective of the year issue 
the company s plan is expected to reduce the level of uncertainty regarding the year issue  however  uncertainty surrounding the issue still exists as a result of the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and vendors 
as a result of this uncertainty  the company is unable to determine  at this time  whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on operations or financial condition
