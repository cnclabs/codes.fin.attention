for the twelve months ended june   net sales for the company totaled million as compared to sales of million in the prior year 
the company reported a net loss of million for fiscal year as compared to a net income of million in fiscal the current loss trend began in the third quarter of fiscal and has continued for each quarter of fiscal the company s operating losses generally have been due to the significant decline in the sales volume in its optical storage business  which historically has accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  the company failed to timely and adequately develop its integrated cd rom controller product and second generation cd rw product 
consequently  for fiscal  the company was dependent on mature cd rom products and its first generation cd rw product for its revenue 
these mature products have continued to decline in both unit sales volumes and average sales price in each successive quarter throughout fiscal although the company is currently sampling its next generation cd rw product  it does not expect to be in mass production with this product until the second half of fiscal on february   the company announced the appointment of young k 
sohn to the office of president and chief executive officer 
mr 
sohn has initiated a comprehensive review of all aspects of the company and has put in place a new management team whose charter is to architect and execute a turnaround plan for the company 
the company is expected to formally announce its turnaround plan in the second half of fiscal the company was originally incorporated in california in and was reincorporated in delaware in its executive offices and principal marketing  sales and product development operations are located at kifer court  sunnyvale  california  telephone number in addition  the company has facilities in andover  massachusetts  taipei  taiwan  tokyo  japan  bristol  england  munich  germany  and shezhen  china 
target markets and products currently  the company s three target markets include optical storage  consumer electronics and digital imaging equipment  which correspond to the company s optical storage group  consumer group and imaging group  respectively 
the company s business strategy and product offerings current and planned for fiscal for each of the target market segments are described below 
optical storage business overview strategy multimedia computer applications have driven the demand for low cost  high density storage mechanisms in recent years 
the adoption of cd rom technology as the mainstream optical storage medium on the desktop was fueled in large measure by data intensive  graphics audio video rich applications that required a universal  high density storage medium 
the company s optical storage group is a leading provider of controllers to the optical storage market and has shipped more than million controllers to date 
more than of the drives shipped to date contain controllers from the company s optical storage group 
a pioneer in this field with the first ide at pi cd rom controller  the company has focused its recent product development efforts on emerging segments of this industry  namely cd rw and dvd drives 
the company s optical storage group currently has solutions for cd rom  cd rw and dvd drives  and its core competencies include ide and alternative interfaces  error correction code ecc  dsp servo control  disc write encoding  wobble servo  write strategy  system design  and system software and firmware 
the company s oem customers for its optical storage products in fiscal included philips  yamaha and mitsumi 
the company s optical storage business faced major challenges during fiscal including rapidly declining average selling prices asps and gross margins  increased competition from both taiwan and japan based competitors  and delays in its integrated cd rom controller product and next generation cd rw product 
currently  the optical storage market is experiencing a myriad of transition as numerous types of new drive mechanisms emerge 
the growth of the sub pc and initial lack of dvd rom has extended the life of cd rom drives on the desktop and has temporarily slowed down the penetration of the dvd rom drives into the pc market 
the dvd rom steep growth is expected to resume over the next year as dvd rom drive costs are further reduced and a wider selection of dvd rom titles becomes available 
however  the optical storage market is currently witnessing an accelerated adoption of cd rw drives  driven by the increased popularity of customized audio cd recordings and the widespread availability of mp audio titles on the internet 
another interesting development is the recent appearance of the combo drive  a cd rw drive with dvd read capability 
this drive offers a wide functionality to the end user and could become a mainstream product if the cost challenges are successfully addressed by the drive manufacturers 
the dvd writable market is off to a slow start  with high prices and multiple competing standards limiting the adoption rate by pc oems 
the dvd writable market is not expected to experience significant growth until the calendar year timeframe as the competing standards consolidate and prices become more competitive 
the company has prepared for these market transitions by focusing its development efforts on the cd rw and dvd technologies  which provide the company the opportunity to offer valuable innovation to its customers in a growing market with technological challenges 
the company s strategy in increasing its market penetration includes technology innovation  protection of intellectual property  and aggressive marketing pricing programs including strategic alliances with drive manufacturers and technology partners 
the cd rw market has picked up considerable momentum as more consumers discover the advantages of this writable and removable medium 
rewritable cd drives are quickly emerging as a strong contender to cd rom drives and though primarily offered today in the retail after market  these optical storage devices are beginning to emerge as the preferred device on the desktop for audio cd generation  archival and data interchange applications 
increased consumer demand and the widespread adoption of cd rw drives by the pc oem manufacturers over the next year are expected to contribute to significant growth in the cd rw market 
the company expects that functional integration will play an important role in cost reduction of the cd rw drives  thereby fueling its mass adoption by pc oems 
to this end  the company has recently announced the oti  offering the most highly integrated and cost effective solution for high performance cd rw drives 
the oti offers a three in one level of integration  combining on one chip the encoder decoder functions  dsp  a full servo sub system  as well as the write strategy and atip demodulator

consumer electronics business overview strategy the emergence of digital video in recent years has created several market opportunities to enable the delivery of digital content to the home by means of entertainment systems such as dvd players  digital television dtv systems and set top boxes stbs 
the rapid migration away from analog to digital technology in the entertainment system market is creating a need for cost effective  complete solutions  including integrated digital circuits and system software  in the consumer electronics market 
this trend is presenting significant opportunities for companies with combined expertise in the development of integrated digital circuits and system software 
in the second half of fiscal  as part of its business redirection efforts  the company established its consumer group to target the emerging digital entertainment system market  with focus on complete silicon based solutions for videodisk player systems dvd and vcd and digital broadcast applications 
the company s consumer group targets opportunities in the emerging digital consumer entertainment market by developing value added integrated circuits and reference design solutions for dvd players and terrestrial set top boxes 
core competencies of the consumer group include mpeg decoding  graphics processing  analog integration  and software expertise at each of the microcode  systems and applications levels 
during the course of fiscal  the consumer group executed on its strategy to withdraw from the low margin  declining vcd market  to focus on the growing dvd player market 
the company expects to have completed its withdrawal from this market in the first half of fiscal since the end of calendar  dvd technology has experienced a strong growth rate  particularly in the us  europe and japan 
the company expects that this trend will continue  and develop in china where dvd has a significant opportunity to become the replacement technology for vcd and s vcd 
during fiscal  the company introduced a robust  cost effective dvd player reference design based on its oti integrated dvd decoder  to provide target oems in japan  china  southeast asia and the us with a ready to manufacture system solution  thereby accelerating their time to market 
the company s strategy  going forward  is to focus on developing cost effective  silicon based  system solutions for this market  which leverages its intellectual property in mpeg  graphics  audio processing and dvd servo technology 
the company is currently in development with its next generation solution for the dvd player market 
the digital broadcast market presents several opportunities for the company to leverage its existing technology investment in mpeg video and audio  graphics processing  digital demodulation  error correction and analog cores 
in fiscal  the company initiated several measures to begin building a position in this market  including establishing a research and development center in bristol  uk oak technology  ltd 
a sales office in munich  germany oak technology gmbh and acquiring key assets of odeum microsystems  inc  including an mpeg audio video decoder and transport demultiplexor and a dvb s compliant qpsk demodulator 
in its product development efforts for fiscal  the company has primarily focused on the digital terrestrial market 
the digital terrestrial market has experienced strong growth during in the uk with both digital terrestrial set top box and integrated digital tv idtv 
the company expects strong adoption to continue for this technology in europe and asia 
the transition of the large installed base of tv sets from analog to digital will create significant opportunity for cost effective silicon based  system solutions 
during fiscal the company delivered two products aimed at this market oti the world s first single chip front end solution for digital terrestrial receivers

manufacturing and design methodology manufacturing the company contracts with independent foundries to manufacture all of its products  enabling the company to focus on its design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
the company is dependent on its foundries to allocate to the company a portion of their foundry capacity sufficient to meet the company s needs to produce products of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver products to the company in a timely manner 
these foundries fabricate products for other companies and some manufacture products of their own design 
the loss of any of these foundries as a supplier  the inability of the company in a period of increased demand for its products to expand the foundry capacity of its current suppliers or qualify other wafer manufacturers for additional foundry capacity  any inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from the company s current or future suppliers or any other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply could delay shipments of the company s products 
delays in shipments could damage relationships with its current and prospective customers  provide an advantage to the company s competitors and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of the company s devices are currently fabricated using complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos process technology with micron and micron feature sizes 
the company is currently designing products for 
micron feature sizes 
all of the company s semiconductor products are assembled and tested by independent subcontractors 
the company s primary suppliers during fiscal year were tsmc and sony 
the company also uses wafer fabrication facilities at chartered  and nec 
the foundries generally are not obligated to supply products to the company for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at a specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
however  in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process techniques  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including various take or pay contracts  such as those with tsmc and chartered as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
the company s reliance on independent manufacturers and third party assembly and testing vendors involves a number of additional risks  including the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
in addition  as a result of the company s dependence on foreign subcontractors  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including foreign government regulation and general political risks  such as political and economic instability  potential hostilities  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions  and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
substantially all of the company s agreements with its offshore wafer fabrication and assembly facilities provide for pricing and payment in us dollars 
the manufacture of semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process 
additionally  the company s products are particularly complex and difficult to manufacture 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose  time consuming and expensive to remedy  all of which can affect the company s time to market with a particular product 
there can be no assurance that the company s foundries will not experience irregularities or adverse yield fluctuations in their manufacturing processes 
any yield or other production problems or shortages of supply experienced by the company or its foundries could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results risks of supply constraints and manufacturing process below 
design methodology the company s products compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly developing technology and evolving industry standards 
the company addresses these issues with a design environment based on workstations  dedicated product simulators  system simulation with hardware and software modeling  and use of a high level design description language in order to define  develop and deliver new and enhanced products more rapidly 
the company s engineering and design capabilities are significant to its future performance  and the company has invested regularly in new advanced equipment and software tools in an effort to keep these tools updated with the latest technology 
the company s library of core cells is key to its ability to reduce the time needed to design new products 
examples of core cells include a cd rom decoder core  cd r w encoder decoder core  cd dsp cd servo core  a parallel  multi pipelined microprocessor core  mpeg core  dvd dsp core  a 
and 
micron memory compiler and a 
and 
micron i o library 
design methodology  including equipment and software tools  is a critical factor with respect to the company s ability to successfully develop technology and products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the equipment  software tools and other resources needed to develop technically advanced products in a timely manner 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results new product introduction below 
marketing and customers from its inception  the company has been committed to a worldwide marketing strategy 
the company utilizes a direct sales force in the united states  germany  japan  taiwan and the peoples republic of china and a worldwide network of manufacturers representatives and distributors in north america  europe and asia 
while customers around the world have many needs in common  each region has its own requirements 
in order to support customers in key geographic markets  the company has established sales and support offices in andover  massachusetts  munich  germany  tokyo  japan  taipei  taiwan and shenzhen  china  in addition to its corporate headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
the company believes that sales and technical support personnel based in the company s regional offices understand the technical needs  business philosophy and culture of their respective customers 
on site personnel are trained to respond to customer needs efficiently and effectively 
the company believes that customer service and technical support are important competitive factors in the optical storage  consumer electronics and digital imaging markets 
the company provides technical support to its customers worldwide 
with a global presence  the company is able to provide prompt technical support to its customers 
in addition  the company s representatives travel frequently to customer sites to assist in design in activity 
the company provides several other types of technical support  including software distribution through an electronic bulletin board  evaluation boards  product demonstration software  engineering design kits and application notes 
the company works closely with its customers in qualification of its products and providing needed quality and reliability data 
in addition  the company makes the latest revision of its software available to its customers and can customize the company s software to a customer s specific requirements 
sales of the company s products are made pursuant to purchase orders and the company has no long term sales agreements with any of its customers 
purchase orders are subject to price renegotiations and to changes in quantities of products and delivery schedules in order to reflect changes in the customers requirements 
in addition  in certain circumstances  orders may be canceled at the discretion of the buyer without penalty 
the company s business  consistent with that of others in the semiconductor industry  is generally characterized by short lead time orders 
the company s actual shipments depend on the manufacturing capacity of the company s foundries 
therefore  as foundry capacity tightens  the company may not be able to meet the customer s requested delivery date or the company may have to put its customers on allocation 
due to its dependence on third party manufacturing capacity  the company believes that backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of actual net revenues for any future period 
sales of cd rom  cd r and cd rw controller products comprised  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of cd rom and cd rw controller products are expected to continue to account for a majority of the company s total revenues for the foreseeable future 
due to the maturation of the cd rom controller market  pressure from the sub pc segment for lower priced components  new competitors  uncertain demand for personal computers and the company s delay in the next generation cd rom product releases  the company has experienced for the past several quarters and is currently experiencing both a decrease in unit sales and prices of its mature cd rom and cd rw controller products  which in turn has had a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
although the company has recently introduced several new products in its attempt to diversify its product and market base  there can be no assurance that these products will be successfully designed  accepted by the company s customers  and brought to production or that the company s customer s products will be accepted in the marketplace 
a substantial majority of the company s revenues in fiscal  and were derived outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
the geographical areas accounting for the company s net revenues in fiscal   and are as follows june  japan other asia europe north america accordingly  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with its international operations  such as political  social and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely affect the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
most of the company s foreign sales are negotiated in us dollars  however  invoicing is often done in local currency 
as a result  the company may be subject to the risks of currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results or require the company to modify its current business practices 
a limited number of customers historically have accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  and  sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  yamaha corporation accounted for and mitsumi accounted for of net revenues 
in fiscal  mitsumi accounted for and lg electronics accounted for of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  mitsumi accounted for and lg electronics accounted for of the company s net revenues 
kanematsu  a japanese trading company  purchases product from the company and resells the product to japanese manufacturers 
the company expects that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company has experienced significant changes from year to year in the composition of its major customer base and believes this pattern will continue 
the company does not have long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
customers generally purchase the company s products subject to cancelable short term purchase orders 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  purchases by current major customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal and the company lost a number of its optical storage customers due to increased competition and the company s failure to timely develop its next generation cd rom and cd rw controller products 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders or that existing orders will not be canceled 
if sales to current customers cease or are reduced  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain the orders from new customers necessary to offset any such losses or reductions 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company could qualify its foundries for potential new customers or that it could do so in a timely manner 
the company currently places noncancelable orders to purchase its products from independent foundries on an approximately three month rolling basis and is currently committed with two of its foundries for certain minimum amounts of capacity for the next several years while its customers generally place purchase orders with the company less than four weeks prior to delivery that may be rescheduled or under certain circumstances may be canceled without penalty 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are rescheduled  canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for that quarter or for the year would be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results risks of supply constraints and manufacturing process below 
competition the optical storage and consumer particularly  video disk player markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining unit average selling prices asps and rapid product obsolescence 
the company is currently experiencing intense competition in both the optical storage and consumer markets and expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter the company s existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or additional features 
the company s existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than the company 
the company s competitors also include a number of emerging companies 
certain of the company s principal competitors in the optical storage market maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from certain capacity  cost  quality control and technological advantages 
in its effort to diversify its customer and market base  in fiscal the company entered the digital broadcast market  a market in which the company has not operated previously 
in general  the company believes that its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  both within and outside of its control  including the price  quality and performance of the company s and its customers products  the timing and success of new product introductions by the company  its customers and its competitors  the emergence of new industry standards  the development of technical innovations  the ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity and sources of raw materials  the efficiency of production  the rate at which the company s customers design the company s products into their products  the market acceptance of the products of the company s customers  the assertion of intellectual property rights and general market and economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
the willingness of prospective customers to design the company s products into their products depends  to a significant extent  upon the ability of the company to have product available at the appropriate market window and to price its products at a level that is cost effective for such customers 
the markets for most of the applications for the company s products  particularly the optical market and the consumer market  are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for the company s products mature and competition increases  the company anticipates that asps on its products will decline 
if the company is unable to reduce its costs sufficiently to offset declines in asps or is unable to successfully introduce new higher performance products with higher asps  the company s business  financial condition and result of operations will be materially adversely affected 
if the company experiences yield or other production problems or shortages of supply that increase its manufacturing costs  or fails to reduce its manufacturing costs  the result could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
prior to the company s entry into the optical storage market  merchant suppliers such as sanyo and captive suppliers such as panasonic  sony and toshiba supplied semiconductor solutions for proprietary and scsi drivers 
although the company was the first company to sell a single chip ide atapi cd rom controller  many competitors including cirrus logic  mediatek and sanyo now offer single chip solutions 
furthermore  companies such as toshiba  panasonic and sony have developed their own ide atapi cd rom controllers and  in addition to using them internally  sell these controllers to the merchant market in competition with the company s products 
as the company integrates more functionality into its controllers  companies that had previously supplied complementary products may also become competitors 
the company expects increased competition in the optical storage market from large  international companies that have their own manufacturing capabilities as this market transitions to cd rw and dvd 
the company s strength in competing against this increased competition in the future will be the technological leadership and customer relationships that it has developed and cultivated over the past several years 
in the videodisk player market  comprised of the company s vcd and dvd products  the company competes primarily with c cube microsystems  ess technology  toshiba  matsushita and lsi logic 
approximately one third of the total available market of the videodisk player market is comprised of captive suppliers 
these captive suppliers are japanese companies that make both chips and players and are members of the dvd forum 
as members of the dvd forum  these companies  as a dvd player manufacturer generally pay a lower patent royalty fee to the forum  and therefore  enjoy a cost advantage over the company s targeted customers making it more difficult for the company s customers and thereby the company to compete successfully 
in the cable  satellite and terrestrial markets  the company competes with sgs thompson  lsi logic  vlsi technology and broadcom 
for the most part  these companies are all large  international companies with a much larger infrastructure than the company 
the cable  satellite and terrestrial markets are all new markets for the company and although this market is still emerging  as a new entrant  the company will be competing with companies who already have a strong relationship with the company s targeted customers 
furthermore  the company expects competition to increase in the future 
for the company to compete successfully in the satellite and terrestrial market  it must develop alliances with tuner and mechanism providers 
the company recently executed a joint development agreement with one of the world s leading digital tv tuner manufacturers on its first generation demodulator chip for the terrestrial market 
however  the company must form additional alliances if the company is to compete successfully in the satellite and terrestrial market 
in the digital imaging market  the company s primary product offerings target the niche  high end market and the company s merchant competition does not offer directly competitive products 
in some cases  the merchant competition offers a subset of the company s product features 
in other cases  the merchant competition offers a software alternative to the company s hardware solution 
however  the company expects direct merchant competition in the niche  high end digital imaging equipment market to emerge in the near future 
despite this lack of direct competition in the merchant market  the company does experience competition with its dsp  compression and resolution enhancement products from internal design groups within the company s targeted customers  such as xerox  hp  canon  hitachi  nec and texas instruments 
as with the merchant market  the company s strength in competing with these internal design teams comes from the breadth of the solution the company is able to provide 
with respect to the company s embedded controller board products  the company competes with peerless  xionics  electronics for imaging and aht 
the company is currently able to provide more silicon on a controller board than its competition providing it with a cost advantage 
however  the company must continue to enhance and strengthen its software capabilities in order to compete successfully in this market 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results competitive market below 
as to the new lower end of products the company is developing for the digital imaging equipment market  the company expects greater direct competition than it currently experiences in the niche  high end market 
research and development the company currently invests substantial resources in its product development efforts 
during fiscal  and  the company spent approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
the company intends to continue to invest in the development of products in each of its core technologies and in products that integrate its core technologies 
the company s performance is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive price and performance levels 
there can be no assurance that products currently under development or any other new products will be successfully developed or will achieve market acceptance 
the failure of the company to introduce new products successfully or the failure of new products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal and most of fiscal  the company failed to timely introduce its integrated cd rom controller and next generation of cd rw controller creating a situation where the company was selling only mature optical storage products which continued to decline in unit volume sales and asps 
this  combined with other factors including increased competition  resulted in a significant decline in revenues 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including recognition of market requirements  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  quality of new products and achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields from the company s contract manufacturers 
due to the design complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays in completing development and introduction of new products  and there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter such delays in the development and introduction of future products 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  that the company s products will be selected for design into the products of its targeted customers or that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
the failure of the company s new product development efforts or the failure of the company to achieve market acceptance of its new products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
proprietary rights and licenses the company s ability to compete is affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company considers its technology to be proprietary and relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company currently has patents granted  patents pending  patents in preparation in the united states  and international patents pending 
the company intends to seek additional international patents and additional united states patents on its technology 
there can be no assurance that additional patents will issue from any of the company s pending applications or applications in preparation  or be issued in all countries where the company s products can be sold  or that any claims allowed from pending applications or applications in preparation will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
additionally  competitors of the company may be able to design around the company s patents 
there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company 
an action is currently pending in the federal district court for the northern district of california seeking to invalidate one of the company s patents relating to it s optical storage products 
moreover  while the company holds or has applied for patents relating to the design of its products  the company s products are based in part on standards  including mpeg  mpeg  jpeg and jbig and the company does not hold patents or other intellectual property rights for such standards 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which has resulted in significant  often protracted and expensive litigation 
although there is currently no pending intellectual property litigation against the company  the company or its foundries may  from time to time  be notified of claims that the company may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
if it is necessary or desirable  the company may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  there can be no assurance that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by the company could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products or the use by the company s foundries of processes requiring the technology 
furthermore  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
in fiscal and again in fiscal  the company filed a complaint with the international trade commission itc against certain asian manufacturers of optical storage controller devices based on the company s belief that such devices infringed one or more of the company s patents 
the complaint seeks a ban on the importation into the united states of any infringing cd rom controller or products containing such infringing cd rom controllers 
see legal proceedings 
litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable determination for the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such development or that such licenses would be available on reasonable terms  or at all  and any such development or license could require expenditures by the company of substantial time and other resources 
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because the company has a limited portfolio of patents  the company may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
if a successful claim is made against the company or its customers and a license is not made available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or the company is required to pay substantial damages or awards  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and confidentiality and license agreements with its customers and potential customers  and limits access to and distribution of the source and object code of its software and other proprietary information 
under some circumstances  the company grants licenses that give its customers limited access to the source code of the company s software which increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of the company s technology 
accordingly  despite precautions taken by the company  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s technology or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or to provide an adequate remedy in the event of a breach or misappropriation by others 
the company has licensed technology from third parties for use in its consumer  optical storage  and digital imaging equipment business  and pursuant thereto is required to fulfill confidentiality obligations and in certain cases pay royalties 
certain of the company s products require that certain copy protection software or other software be obtained if the products are to be marketable and exportable 
should the company lose its rights to or be unable to obtain the necessary copy protection software  the company would be unable to sell and market certain of its mpeg and optical storage products geared for the dvd market 
the company licenses the sun microsystems sparc core for use with a number of its consumer products for which it is obligated to pay a royalty based on a percentage of the net selling price of such products 
the company has also entered into a number of joint development and supply arrangements pursuant to which the company jointly develops a product with another company or contracts with another company to develop a product or component for it and then purchases the product or component from such company for resale with other company products 
in addition  the company has on occasion purchased off the shelf products to resell bundled with its own product 
in the future  it may be necessary or desirable for the company to seek additional licenses to intellectual property rights held by third parties or purchase products manufactured and or sold by third parties with respect to some or all of its product offerings 
there can be no assurance that such licenses or purchases will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the inability of the company to enter such license arrangements on acceptable terms or to maintain its current licenses on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company may be unable to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights and the company may be unable to obtain third party intellectual property rights and or may be liable for significant damages below 
employees as of june   the company had full time employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  and in finance  administration and operations 
the company believes that its future performance will depend  in part  on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel  particularly highly skilled design engineers and software programmers involved in new product development  for whom competition is intense 
the company s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit and the company has never experienced a work stoppage 
the company believes that its employee relations are good

nc 
this action alleged violations of the delaware general corporation law and breaches of fiduciary duty and was brought on behalf of all of the company s common stockholders at any time between august  and november  the plaintiffs claims are based upon the board of directors adoption on or about august  of a stockholder rights plan the rights plan that included a provision that limited the redemption or modification of the rights plan to its continuing directors or their designated successors 
the plaintiffs alleged that the rights plan with the continuing directors provision disenfranchises public stockholders by forcing them to vote for incumbent directors who enjoy full voting rights  that it restricts the ability of future directors to exercise their full statutory prerogatives  and that the particular provision at issue is an unreasonable and disproportionate response to any threatened takeover 
the plaintiffs sought an injunction and a declaratory judgment that the rights plan is invalid and unenforceable and monetary damages for the alleged violations of fiduciary duty

in its press release regarding the results of operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reported a net loss of million  its sixth consecutive quarterly loss 
the decrease in fourth quarter revenue and continued loss is primarily due to a product transition in the company s optical storage business which in fiscal accounted for over of the company s total revenue as the company moves to its next generation cd rw controller  which is not expected to reach mass production until the second half of fiscal although the company is continuing to ship its single function cd rom controllers  integrated cd rom controllers and first generation cd rw controller  unit volumes and asps of these products have declined and will continue to decline as these products mature 
on february   the company announced the appointment of young k 
sohn to the office of president and chief executive officer 
mr 
sohn has completed a comprehensive review of all aspects of the company and has hired additional members of the management team whose charter will be to architect and execute a turnaround plan for the company 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results have been  and will continue to be  affected by a wide variety of factors that could have a material adverse effect on revenues and profitability during any particular period  including competitive pressures on selling prices  availability and cost of foundry capacity and raw materials  fluctuations in yield  loss of any strategic relationships  the company s ability to introduce new products in accordance with oem design requirements and design cycles  new product introductions by the company s competitors and market acceptance of product sold by both the company and its customers 
in addition  the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations in the markets for its customers products  particularly the consumer electronics and personal computer markets  which have been extremely volatile in the past  and the terrestrial broadcast market  which is in an early stage  creating uncertainty with respect to product volume and timing 
the company has devoted a substantial portion of its research and development efforts in recent quarters to developing chips used in both digital video disk dvd systems  cd rw drivers  digital broadcast systems and inkjet multi function peripherals 
the company s dvd  cd rw  digital broadcast and digital imaging products are subject to the new product risks described in the preceding paragraph  including in particular the company s ability to timely introduce these products and the market s acceptance of them  which could have a materially adverse effect on its operating results 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated june  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses acquisition related charges restructuring charge operating income loss non operating income  net income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
net revenues decreased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year approximately two thirds of the revenue decrease was attributable to a decrease in unit sales of cd rom controllers compared to fiscal  with the remainder of the decrease due to a decline in the average selling price asp of the cd rom controllers 
the decrease in unit sales was due to a loss of cd rom and cd rw market share  the maturation of the cd rom market  development delays in the company s next generation cd rom and cd rw products  and to a lesser extent  economic downturns in the asian markets to which a large majority of the company s products are sold 
overall  sales of optical storage products  which accounted for of the company s revenues in the prior fiscal year  declined in fiscal year for fiscal years and  sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
two customers accounted for over of revenues in fiscal  compared to three customers in fiscal international sales  principally to japan  korea  singapore  and belgium accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in net revenues for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  of nonrefundable technology license fees and royalties 
the company anticipates that net revenues for at least the first two quarters of fiscal year will continue to be significantly less than the comparable periods of the previous fiscal year as the company completes its transition to its next generation cd rw controllers  which are not expected to reach mass production until the second half of fiscal see factors that may affect future results below 
gross margin 
cost of revenues includes the cost of wafer fabrication  assembly and testing performed by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with the procurement  scheduling and quality assurance functions performed by the company 
the company s gross margin decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of a decrease in asps for the company s cd rom controller products which was only partially offset by a decrease in the company s unit cost for the same products 
additionally  operations costs included in cost of goods sold  which were relatively flat on a dollar basis  became higher as a percentage of revenues due to the significant decline in sales volumes 
gross margin in fiscal includes a million provision for potential forfeiture of certain foundry deposits with chartered semiconductor 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
gross margin in fiscal included the impact of a charge to cost of revenues related to increases in inventory reserves of million recorded during the year as well as a million charge related to the discontinuation of the graphics and audio communications businesses 
excluding the impact of these inventory and foundry related charges  gross margin would have been in fiscal and in fiscal the company s overall gross margin is subject to change due to various factors  including  among others  competitive product pricing  yields  wafer costs  assembly and test costs and product mix 
the company expects that asps for its existing products will continue to decline over time and that asps for each new product will decline significantly over the life of the product 
the company continues to experience severe price pressure on its cd rom controller products and expects such price erosion to continue 
the company does not believe it can achieve cost reductions or sales of new products with higher gross margins which fully offset the expected price declines of its cd rom products and therefore  it expects gross margin percentages to decline 
in addition  given the extremely competitive nature of the optical storage and consumer market  the company believes that gross margins for new products in its optical storage market and consumer market will be lower than historical levels and that  as a result  gross margins in general will decline in the future 
research and development expenses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million and million  and expressed as a percentage of net revenues were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase in research and development spending for fiscal compared to was primarily due to the hiring of additional technical personnel  as well as increased purchased technology amortization expense related to the odeum  viewpoint and xli acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and first quarter of fiscal year research and development expenses increased significantly as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal this increase was due to the significant decrease in the company s net revenues compared to fiscal the company will continue to invest substantial resources in research and development in an effort to complete the development of its new products in the company s target markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company incurred approximately million of consulting fees and other expenses related to the evaluation of a buyout proposal from gold acquisition group 
additionally  legal expenses related to the complaint the company filed with the international trade commission itc on april  and additional litigation were higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal year see legal proceedings 
the increase from to was also due to the hiring of additional management and administrative personnel since the year ago periods  and associated expenses 
s  g a expenses increased significantly as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to the significant decrease in the company s net revenues 
acquisition related charges 
acquisition related charges include the costs associated with the acquisitions of viewpoint and xli in fiscal and the acquisition of certain assets of odeum in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired viewpoint and xli see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
of the combined purchase prices of the two companies  million was allocated to in process research and development ipr d and was charged to operations million related to viewpoint  million related to xli 
substantially all of the remainder of the purchase prices of the two companies aside from allocations to tangible assets totaling million was allocated to purchased technology and other intangible assets totaling million recorded on the company s balance sheet  and is being amortized to operations on a straight line basis over three years 
in march  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with odeum and hyundai electronics america pursuant to which the company agreed to acquire certain assets of odeum for million 
the transaction was consummated in april and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and was charged to operations in fiscal restructuring charges 
during  the company discontinued its graphics and audio communications businesses and incurred a charge to operations of approximately million related to these discontinued businesses 
the million charge consisted of million related to a write off of prepaid royalties  approximately million for severance pay and million for miscellaneous charges 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
nonoperating income 
for fiscal  non operating income  net  consisted primarily of net interest income of million 
for fiscal  non operating income  net  included net interest income of million  net foreign currency exchange losses of million and approximately million related to the settlement agreement between the company and united microelectronics corporation in connection with a complaint the company filed with the itc on july  the decrease in net interest income was due primarily to a reduction in the company s invested cash balance for most of fiscal prior to the receipt of the proceeds of the sale of the uicc investment discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a small net foreign currency exchange gain in fiscal  due to strengthening of the japanese yen as compared to the exchange loss in fiscal income taxes 
the effective tax benefit rate for fiscal year was 
the benefit rate was significantly less than statutory rates due to limitations on net operating loss carryback benefits available to the company  as well as an increase to the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax asset 
the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal  which was lower than statutory rates as a result of research and development credits earned by the company becoming a higher percentage of the company s lower taxable income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
the company s net revenues in the comparison periods were primarily derived from product sales 
net revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in revenues from the sales of cd rom controller products and video cd products partially offset by an increase in revenues from the sale of digital imaging products 
the decrease in revenues from cd rom controller products was primarily due to a decrease in the average selling prices asps of the products partially offset by an increase in unit sales 
the decrease in revenues from video cd products was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales as well as a decrease in asps 
the increase in revenues from the sales of digital imaging equipment products was primarily the result of an increase in unit sales partially offset by a decrease in asps 
net revenues from sales of the company s cd rom controller products were approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  accounting for and of net revenues  respectively 
although the company is attempting to diversify its revenue product base in the three core markets of optical storage  consumer electronics and digital imaging  it anticipates that cd rom controller sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of its revenue in the foreseeable future 
net revenues from sales to the company s top ten customers in fiscal and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
international sales  principally to japan  taiwan  korea and belgium accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease in international sales  as a percentage of total sales  is primarily attributable to a decrease in international revenues as well as an increase in domestic revenues in the comparison periods 
included in net revenues for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  of nonrefundable technology license fees 
sales of products related to the graphics and audio communications businesses which the company discontinued in the quarter ended march   accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal gross margin in fiscal included the impact of a charge to cost of revenues related to increases in inventory reserves of million recorded during the year as well as a million charge related to the discontinuation of the graphics and audio communications businesses 
excluding the impact of these inventory related charges  gross margin in fiscal would have been 
gross margin in fiscal included the impact of a charge to cost of revenues related to increases in inventory reserves of million recorded during the year 
additionally  gross margin in fiscal included the impact of favorable adjustments to cost of revenues of approximately million associated with the sale of products which had been fully reserved in a prior period as well as manufacturing cost adjustments of million related to foundry agreements 
excluding the impact of these adjustments  gross margin for fiscal would have been 
the increase in gross margin during the comparison periods  excluding the impact of the adjustments recorded in fiscal and fiscal  was primarily the result of a product mix shift to higher margin cd r w controllers and digital imaging products during the comparison periods 
gross margins related to the graphics and audio communications businesses which the company discontinued in the quarter ended march  accounted for less than and of the company s total gross margin contribution in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million  and expressed as a percentage of net revenues were and in fiscal and  respectively 
this increase in research and development expenditures in fiscal  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues was primarily the result of the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal additionally  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was principally the result of the hiring of additional management and administrative personnel and associated expenses  costs associated with the implementation of a new management information system as well as increases in legal expenses 
the increase in legal expenses relates primarily to a complaint the company filed with the international trade commission on july  itc complaint and additional litigation related to a settlement agreement with one of the parties in the itc complaint 
acquisition related charges 
acquisition related charges for fiscal included costs associated with the acquisitions of pixel magic 
in november  the company acquired pixel magic  a privately held company based in andover  massachusetts for million in cash  of which million was contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria over a three year period 
approximately million of the initial cash payment was allocated to in process research and development and was charged to operations in fiscal in june  the company waived certain of the performance criteria and agreed to pay the contingent amount of million in two installments during calendar the first payment of million was paid in january and the second payment of million is due in december as a result of this agreement and because the contingent amount was based  in part  on the continued employment of the former shareholder employees of pixel magic  inc  the company recorded a compensation charge of million in fiscal non operating income  net 
non operating income  net consisted primarily of net interest income of million  net foreign currency transaction losses of million and approximately million related to the settlement agreement between the company and united microelectronics corporation in connection with a complaint the company filed with the international trade commission on july  see legal proceedings 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in effective rate is primarily due to the company s continued decrease in taxable income along with the substantial research and development credits earned by the company offset by a partial valuation allowance recorded during see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business 
quarterly results are subject to significant fluctuation  future revenues are unpredictable and subject to seasonality 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors  including factors that generally affect everyone in its industry and factors that are more specific to its business and product lines 
the principal risk the company faces in its business and one which has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant effect on its operating results  is its dependence on the optical storage market 
other factors specific to its business and product lines include the following the company s ability to diversify its product offerings and the markets for its products  the current market for its products  the loss or gain of important customers  the timing of significant orders and order cancellations or reschedulings  pricing policy changes by oak and its competitors and suppliers  the potential for significant inventory exposure  the timing of the development and introduction of new products or enhanced versions of existing products  market acceptance of new products  increased competition in product lines  barriers to entry into new product lines  and the competitiveness of oak s customers 
in addition  the company s quarterly operating results could be materially adversely affected by any judgment or settlement in the company s ongoing stockholder legal proceedings 
the company believes that quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to continue to vary significantly in the future and period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
readers should not rely on period to period comparisons as indications of future performance 
other factors generally affecting the semiconductor industry include the following rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  availability of foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of raw materials  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  seasonal customer demand  potential for erosion of product prices  and general economic conditions 
the semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity  periods of production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
in addition  the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of product prices 
any downturns in the industry would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations the company has experienced in the past and may in the future experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to these general semiconductor industry conditions 
the downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both the semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and subsequent accelerated erosion of average selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than a year 
even if customers aggregate demand were not to decline  the availability of additional capacity can adversely impact pricing levels  which can also depress revenue levels 
any one or a combination of the above factors may adversely affect the business and financial condition of the company 
history of operating losses 
although the company experienced periods of profitability following its reincorporation in delaware in october in connection with its initial public offering the company was first incorporated in california in  the company sustained losses following the initial public offering 
further  while the company had net income of million in fiscal  the company experienced a net loss of million in fiscal its current loss trend began in calendar year  resulting in an operating loss of million for fiscal and an operating loss of million for fiscal in each case before adjustments for non operating income or loss  or income tax expense or benefit 
the company s operating losses generally have been due to the company s dependence on its optical storage business  which historically has accounted for approximately of its business 
in fiscal  the company failed to timely and or adequately develop its integrated cd rom controller product and second generation cd rw product 
consequently  for fiscal  the company was dependent on mature cd rom products and its first generation cd rw product for its revenue 
these mature products have continued to decline in both unit sales volume and average sales price in each successive quarter 
the company is currently sampling its next generation cd rw product  but the company cannot accurately predict the level of customer acceptance and the product s impact on operating results 
if the company incurs additional losses or fails to achieve profitability in the future  this will have a material adverse effect on the company s business and may affect the trading price of the company common stock 
dependence on cd rom and cd rw controller products 
sales of the company s cd rom and cd rw controller products comprised  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company s future revenue generation is highly dependent on the successful introduction of its next generation cd rw product  although the company can provide no assurance that this product will achieve customer acceptance 
although sales of cd rom controller products are expected to continue to account for a portion of the company s total revenues for the foreseeable future  the company expects that sales of its cd rom controller products will continue to decline 
the company is no longer developing any cd rom controllers  but is instead focusing its development efforts on controllers for cd rw and dvd applications 
if the company experiences delays in its product development efforts or fails to achieve market acceptance  the company will need other sources of revenue to offset the continued decline in sales of its cd rom controllers 
although the company was a leading supplier of cd rw controllers  due to product delays in its second generation cd rw product  the company lost its leadership in this market 
while the company is currently sampling its next generation cd rw product  no assurance can be given this product will be competitive in the marketplace or accepted by the company s targeted customers 
in addition  even if this product proves to be competitive and is accepted by targeted customers  there is no assurance that the company s customers will be successful 
the company also faces increased competition in the emerging cd rw and dvd markets 
see competitive market 
moreover  the current trend toward integrating increased functionality on the cd rom  cd rw or dvd controller potentially adds to the development and manufacturing costs of producing the controller 
the company s revenues and gross margins from its optical storage controller products will be dependent on the company s ability to introduce these integrated products in a commercially competitive manner 
the decrease in the overall level of sales of  and prices for  the company s cd rom and older generation cd rw controller product due to introductions of newer products by competitors  the decline in demand for cd rom controller products generally  product obsolescence and delays in the company s integrated cd rom controller product and its next generation cd rw product  have had a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  and will continue to have that effect if the company fails to successfully introduce new products to the market and have these products accepted by targeted customers 
pricing issues 
the willingness of prospective customers to design the company s products into their products depends  to a significant extent  upon the ability of the company to have product available at the appropriate market window and to price its products at a level that is cost effective for such customers 
the markets for most of the applications for the company s products  especially in the consumer electronics market and the optical storage market  are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for the company s products mature and competition increases  as has been the trend for the optical storage and digital video disk segment of the consumer electronics market  the company anticipates that asps on its products will decline 
the company continually attempts to pursue cost reductions  including process enhancements  in order to maintain acceptable gross profit margins 
gross profit margins also vary reflecting the impact of changes in the general condition of the economy  capacity utilization levels in the semiconductor industry  customer acceptance of new technologies and products  product functionality and capabilities  shifts in product mix  manufacturing yields and the effect of ongoing manufacturing cost reduction activities 
if the company is unable to reduce its costs sufficiently to offset declines in asps or is unable to successfully introduce new higher performance products with higher asps  the company s operating results will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if the company experiences yield or other production problems or shortages of supply that increase its manufacturing costs  fails to reduce its manufacturing costs  or fails to utilize its prepaid deposits with the tsmc and chartered foundries  the result would be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
new product introductions 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by evolving industry standards  rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the company s financial performance is highly dependent upon timely and successful execution of next generation and new products  particularly in light of the continued decline in sales from the company s mature cd rom and cd rw products and the company s failure to timely develop new products for the optical storage market in fiscal and specifically  the company s performance is highly dependent upon the successful development  timely introduction and customer acceptance of its next generation cd rw controller  mpeg decoder for the dvd player market  and imaging processing chip for the digital imaging equipment market 
if the company fails to introduce new products successfully or its new products fail to achieve market acceptance  its business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including recognition of market requirements  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  quality of new products  differentiation of the company s products from those of its competitors  improvements in existing technologies  and development and implementation of new process technologies to reduce semiconductor die size  improve device performance in manufacturing yield  adapt product and processes to technological changes  and adopt emerging industry standards 
in both the optical storage and consumer electronics markets  particularly dvd  a variety of standards and formats are being proposed  making it difficult to develop product to market requirements  and making it even more difficult for the market to develop 
the success of the company s efforts is also dependent upon securing sufficient foundry capacity for volume manufacturing of wafers and achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields from the company s contract manufacturers 
see the discussion of risks related to foundry capacity under the heading risks of supply constraints and manufacturing process above 
due to the design complexity of the company s products  especially with the increased levels of integration that are required  the company has experienced delays in completing development and introduction of new products  particularly in its products for the optical storage and the digital imaging equipment markets 
no assurance can be given that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or that its products will be selected for design into the products of its targeted customers 
also  there can be no assurance that the products of the company s customers will be successfully introduced into the market 
if the company fails in its new product development efforts or its products fail to achieve market acceptance  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
acquisitions 
the company has begun to pursue  and will continue to pursue  opportunities to acquire key technology to augment its technical capabilities or to achieve faster time to market as an alternative to developing such technology internally 
on july   the company announced its intention to acquire xionics document technology  inc  a leading supplier of embedded software for the digital imaging market 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  the coordination of sales  marketing and research and development  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in addition  investments in emerging technology present risks of loss of value of one or more of the investments due to failure of the technology to gain the predicted market acceptance 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions made by the company could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
in addition  with such acquisitions  there is the risk that future operating performance may be unfavorably impacted due to acquisition related costs such as  but not limited to  in process research and development charges  additional development expenses  lower gross margins generated by the sales of acquired products and restructuring costs associated with duplicate facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired odeum microsystems  inc odeum and allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development which was expensed and approximately million to purchased technology  goodwill and other intangible assets which are recorded on the company s balance sheet 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired viewpoint and allocated approximately million to in process research and development and approximately million to purchased technology and other intangible assets 
also in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired xli and allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development and approximately million to purchased technology and other intangible assets 
for the viewpoint and xli acquisitions  the valuation of the acquired in process research and development used by the company in making its determination as to the amount of in process research and development expense was supported by valuation studies prepared by an independent third party appraiser 
for the odeum acquisition  the acquired in process research and development valuation was based on oak management s best estimate based on their analysis of the progress of the odeum research and development in process at the acquisition date and the anticipated cash flows to be derived from the resulting products 
in september  a representative of the securities and exchange commission the sec provided the american institute of certified public accountants with guidance as to the factors to be considered in the valuation of in process research and development 
although the company believes that the amounts of the recorded in process research and development expense are reasonable when applying these factors  there can be no assurance that the sec will not review the company s valuations  which review could result in the company making adjustments to the reported amounts of in process research and development expense for the years ended june  and any such adjustment could result in an increase in the amount of purchased technology and other intangibles recorded with respect to the acquisitions of odeum  viewpoint  and xli  which would result in higher amortization expenses  and therefore  adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s markets experience rapid technological change 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter the company s existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or additional features 
the company s existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than the company 
the company s competitors also include a number of emerging companies as well as some of the company s own customers and suppliers 
moreover  the company is currently attempting to enter several new segments of the consumer electronics market in which the company has not previously operated 
these markets are intensely competitive  and the company will have to compete with large domestic and international companies  some of whom have long standing relationships with the company s target customers 
the company must continue to enhance its current product line and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with the technological developments of its competitors 
the company must also satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
if the company cannot successfully respond to the technological advances of others or if its new products or product enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
competitive markets 
the optical storage and consumer electronics markets in which the company competes is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  declining unit average sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
in these two markets the company s existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than the company 
the company s competitors also include a number of emerging companies as well as some of the company s own customers and suppliers 
furthermore  the company is currently attempting to enter the digital broadcast market in which it has not previously operated 
this market is intensely competitive and the company will have to compete with large domestic and international companies that have long standing relationships with target customers 
the willingness of prospective customers to design the company products into their products depends  to a significant extent  upon the company s ability to have product available at the appropriate market window and to price these products at a level that is cost effective for these customers 
the markets for most of the  applications for the company s products  especially in the consumer electronics market and the optical storage market  are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for these products mature and competition increases  as has been the trend for the optical storage and dvd segment of the consumer electronics market  the company anticipates that average sales prices on products will decline 
if the company is unable to reduce costs sufficiently to offset declines in average sales prices or is unable to successfully introduce new higher performance products with higher average sales prices  operating results will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if the company experiences yield or other production problems or shortages of supply that increase manufacturing costs  fail to reduce manufacturing costs or fail to utilize prepaid deposits with foundries  the company s business  financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 
certain of the company s principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from certain capacity  cost and technological advantages 
in addition  in the digital imaging market  the most intense competition comes from captive suppliers  and increased competition is anticipated from captive suppliers to the optical storage market as this market transitions to dvd 
also  the ability to compete successfully in the pc and consumer dvd market and digital broadcast markets depends on the ability to develop partnerships with other companies established in the industry and to gain recognition in such markets 
there can be no assurance that participation in these new markets will produce positive results 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  both within and outside of its control  including the following price  quality and performance of the company s and its customers products  the timing and success of new product introductions by the company  its customers and competitors  the development of technical innovations  the ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity and sources of raw materials  the efficiency of production  the rate at which its customers design its products into their products  the market acceptance of the products of its customers  the number and nature of its competitors in a given market  the ability to protect its proprietary information and to obtain or preserve its rights to the intellectual property of other parties necessary in its business  and general market and economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against respective current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by it and its customers will not have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of the combined company 
the company may be unable to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights 
the company s ability to compete is affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company considers its technology to be proprietary and relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect intellectual property rights 
however  these measures afford only limited protection 
competitors of the company may be able to effectively design around the company s patents 
there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted under those patents will provide competitive advantages to the company 
moreover  while the company holds or has applied for patents relating to the design of its products  some of the company s products are based in part on standards  for which the company does not hold patents or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
moreover  the company intends to seek additional international and united states patents on its technology 
there can be no assurance that additional patents will issue from any of the company s pending applications or applications in preparation  or be issued in all countries where the company s products can be sold  or that any claims allowed from pending applications or applications in preparation will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
furthermore  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
in fiscal and again in fiscal  the company filed a complaint with the international trade commission itc against certain asian manufacturers of optical storage controller devices based on the company s belief that those devices infringed one or more of the company s patents 
the complaint seeks a ban on the importation into the united states of any infringing cd rom controller or products containing infringing cd rom controllers 
the company has incurred significant legal expenses in connection with each of these lawsuits 
any litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not that litigation results in a favorable determination for the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in developing new technology or that those licenses would be available on reasonable terms  or at all  and any development or license could require expenditures by the company of substantial time and other resources 
the company also generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and consultants and confidentiality and license agreements with its customers and potential customers  and limits access to and distribution of the source and object code of its software and other proprietary information 
under some circumstances  the company grants licenses that give its customers limited access to the source code of the company s software which increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of the company s technology 
accordingly  despite precautions taken by the company  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s technology or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or to provide an adequate remedy in the event of a breach or misappropriation by others 
the company may be unable to obtain third party intellectual property rights 
certain technology used in the company s products is licensed from third parties  and in connection with these licenses  the company is required to fulfill confidentiality obligations and  in some cases  pay royalties 
some of the company s products  require various types of copy protection software that the company must license from third parties 
should the company lose its rights to  or be unable to obtain the necessary copy protection software  the company would be unable to sell and market certain of its products 
the company s agreements with third parties often have no specified term and may be terminated by either party in the event of breach by the other 
the company s business could be adversely affected by the loss for any reason of these third party agreements 
given the trend to include increasing levels of functionality on a chip  in the future it may be necessary or desirable for the company to seek additional licenses to intellectual property rights held by third parties or purchase products manufactured and or sold by third parties with respect to some or all of its product offerings 
there can be no assurance that those licenses or purchases will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the inability of the company to enter into those license arrangements on acceptable terms or to maintain its current licenses on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which has resulted in significant  often protracted and expensive litigation 
the company or its foundries may  from time to time  be notified of claims that the company may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
if it is necessary or desirable  the company may seek licenses under those patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  there can be no assurance that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by the company could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities and suspend the manufacture of products or the use by the company s foundries of processes requiring the technology 
although patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements  the company may not be able in any or every instance  to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement  especially given that the company has a limited patent portfolio 
if a successful claim is made against the company or its customers and a license is not made available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or the company is required to pay substantial damages or awards  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with the use of independent foundries and assembly and test vendors and minimum purchase supply contracts 
the company contracts with independent foundries to manufacture all of its products  and with independent vendors to assemble and test its products 
under its foundry agreements  the company is required to place non cancelable orders and purchase its products on an approximately three month rolling basis 
the company is currently committed under an agreement with two of its foundries to purchase certain minimum amounts of capacity 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million loss provision against its deposit with one of its foundries 
the company s customers  on the other hand  generally place purchase orders with the company less than four weeks prior to delivery that may be rescheduled or under certain circumstances may be cancelled  without significant penalty 
due to the company s relatively narrow customer base for certain devices and the short product life cycles of the company s products  these cancellations can leave the company with significant inventory exposure 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are rescheduled  canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  the company s expense in inventory levels could be disproportionately high  which would materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations for that quarter or for the year 
in addition  the company is dependent on its foundries to allocate to the company a portion of their foundry capacity sufficient to meet its needs to produce products of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yield and to deliver products to the company in a timely manner 
these foundries fabricate products for other companies and some manufacture products of their own design 
if there is a decrease in available foundry capacity  it is likely that the lead time required to manufacture the company s products will increase  which may materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in periods of manufacturing capacity shortages  the company may not be able to meet its customers required delivery time 
also  if the company is unable to timely respond to its customers needs  the company may lose customer orders 
insufficient orders will result in under utilization of the company manufacturing facilities and prepayments with two of the company s foundries for certain minimum amounts of capacity  which also will adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
product supply and demand fluctuations common to the semiconductor industry are historically characterized by periods of manufacturing capacity shortages immediately followed by periods of overcapacity  which are caused by the addition of manufacturing capacity in large increments 
the industry has moved from a period of capacity shortages in to what has been a period of excess capacity for approximately the last twelve months  although capacity has recently tightened 
during a period of industry overcapacity  profitability can drop sharply as factory utilization declines and high fixed costs of operating a wafer fabrication facility are spread over a lower net revenue base 
no assurance can be given that the company can or will achieve timely  cost effective access to that capacity when needed 
factors which could damage relationships with the company s current and prospective customers or provide an advantage to its competitors include the loss of any foundry as a supplier  inability in a period of increased demand for the company s products to expand foundry capacity  inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from current or future suppliers  delays in shipments of the company s products  disruption of operations at any of the company s manufacturing facilities  and product defects and the difficulty of detecting and remedying product defects 
the company s reliance on independent manufacturers and third party assembly and testing vendors involve a number of additional risks  including the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies  and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
any problems with supply could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
as the company generally does not use multiple services of supply for its products  the consequences of these factors occurring is magnified 
in addition  as a result of the company s dependence on foreign subcontractors  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including foreign government regulation and general political risks  which include the risks described under the heading risks pertaining to international business below 
risks pertaining to international business 
during fiscal  and   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues were derived from international sales 
a large portion of the company s revenues are derived from international sales 
a substantial portion of the company s international revenues are derived from manufacturers of cd rom drives in japan  taiwan  korea and singapore 
most of the company s foreign sales are negotiated in us dollars  although invoicing is often done in local currency 
as a result  the company may be subject to the risks of currency fluctuations in these and other countries 
the company is subject to the additional risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include unexpected changes in  or impositions of  foreign legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse taxes and adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  political  social and economic instability  potential hostilities  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and fluctuations in foreign currencies 
for example  the company has made a significant investment in foundry capacity in taiwan and is subject to the risk of political instability in taiwan  including the potential for conflict between taiwan and the people s republic of china 
in addition  china is the primary market for the company s consumer dvd and cable and satellite products  and  therefore  any political or economic instability in china could significantly reduce the demand for these products 
while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to forecast  any one or more of these factors could adversely affect the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
limited customer base 
the company has derived a substantial portion of its net revenues from a limited number of customers and expects this concentration to continue 
these customers were all purchasers of the company s cd rom and cd rw products 
please see the discussion above under the heading dependence on cd rom and cd rw controller product for a description of the decline in revenues the company has experienced in connection with sales of our cd rom product 
at june   one international customer accounted for approximately of accounts receivable 
in addition  the company has experienced significant changes from year to year in the composition of its major customer base  including the loss in the past year of two customers who combined were responsible for approximately of the company s sales in fiscal year the company believes this pattern will continue 
customers generally purchase the company s products pursuant to short term purchase orders  and the company has no long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
the loss of or significant reduction in purchases by  current major customers of the company would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
need for additional capital 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continue to make investments in new facilities and capital equipment  and significant amounts of capital additions could be required in subsequent years 
additionally  in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process techniques  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including various take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investment  which may require the company to seek additional financing 
the company believes that existing liquid resources and funds generated from operations  if any  combined with its ability to borrow funds will be adequate to meet its operating and capital requirements and obligations into the foreseeable future 
the company believes that the level of a company s financial resources is an important factor in its industry 
accordingly  the company may from time to time seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that those funds will be available on terms acceptable to the company when needed 
any future equity financing will also lead to dilution to existing shareholders 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future performance depends  to a significant degree  on the retention and contribution of members of the company s senior management as well as other key personnel 
in february  the company appointed a new president and chief executive officer  young k 
sohn 
it is important for the company to retain the services of mr 
sohn 
in fiscal  the company also appointed a new vice president and general manager to head its optical storage group  a new chief financial officer  a new vice president of sales  and a new vice president of human resources 
the company is in the process of recruiting additional senior management positions as well as technical personnel 
competition for these persons is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain additional senior managers and technical personnel 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company is dependent  to a significant extent  on computer technology with date sensitive functions 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing incorrect reporting and disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the issue spans both information technology and non information technology systems that use date data 
in addition to the company s own systems  the company relies  directly and indirectly  on external systems of its customers  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  utilities providers and government entities  both domestic and international 
the company s committee for the year issue has a year project plan consisting of the following five phases inventory assessment  conversion  vendor readiness  contingency planning  testing and implementation 
the inventory assessment  conversion  testing and implementation phases of the project were complete as of august   and the company is in the process of concluding the vendor readiness and developing the contingency planning phases 
the entire year project is expected to be completed in the fall of in its inventory assessment phase  the company examined well over two thousand items for year compliance 
for internal systems  the company examined all network components  pcs  unix workstations  business applications  cad systems  desktop applications  operating systems  testers  telephone system  fax  copiers  security and environmental systems 
the company purchased a yk tool and repaired all pc bios and converted all excel and access data files 
the company has also upgraded all servers  workstations and network components 
major business application systems including the oracle enterprise resource planning system and factoryworks manufacturing execution system have been fully upgraded and tested to yk compliance status 
the company s wide area network was successfully tested to be yk ready 
the security system was upgraded to be yk compliant 
the company also obtained yk compliance statements from cad systems  telephone  energy and environmental system vendors 
further upgrades are to be applied to some desktop applications before the end of year 
the company is actively responding to all customer requests for compliance  surveys and other general information related to its year programs 
the company will also request assurance from its key customers that they  and their products which incorporate the company products  are year compliant 
the company will develop a contingency plan that will address the non compliance of vendors suppliers and any worst case year issues that the company may be confronted with 
in the worst case  the company or the key customers and or suppliers on which it depends may be unable to produce reliable information or process routine transactions 
furthermore  in the worst case  the company or parties on which it depends may  for an extended period of time be incapable of conducting critical business activities  which include but are not limited to  manufacturing and shipping products  invoicing customers and paying vendors 
all product related assessments and testing were completed as of june  updates or status on products are available on the company s web site www 
oaktech 
com 
the company considers a product or system to be year compliant if the date time data is accurately processed including  but not limited to  calculating  comparing  and sequencing from  into and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  and the years and along with leap year calculations 
to date  the company has not identified any non compliant products and therefore  no material costs have been incurred with respect to remediation 
the company believes that it is unlikely to experience a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations due to product related year compliance issues 
the foregoing statements are based upon management s best estimates at the present time  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected programs  the rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs and the success of the company s external customers and suppliers in addressing the year issue 
as the year project continues  the company may discover additional year problems  may not be able to develop  implement  or test remediation or contingency plans in a timely manner  or may find that the costs of these activities exceed current expectations and become material 
in many cases  the company is relying on assurances from suppliers and customers that new and upgraded information systems and other products will be year compliant 
the company is testing certain third party products  but cannot be sure that its tests will be adequate or that  if problems are identified  they will be addressed by the supplier in a timely and satisfactory way 
because the company uses a variety of information systems and has additional systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure  the company cannot be sure that all of its systems will work together in a year compliant fashion 
furthermore  the company cannot be sure that it will not suffer business interruptions  either because of its own year problems or those of its customers or suppliers whose year problems may make it difficult or impossible for them to fulfill their commitments to the company 
if the company fails to satisfactorily resolve year issues related to its products in a timely manner  it could be exposed to liability to third parties 
if the company or the third parties with which it has relationships were to cease or not successfully complete its or their year remediation efforts  the company would encounter disruptions to its business that could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial position and results of operations 
the company could be materially and adversely impacted by widespread economic or financial market disruption or by year computer system failures at third parties with which it has relationships 
the company has not yet developed a contingency plan that addresses how it plans to handle any of the worst case year issues that may confront it  but instead has focused its resources on identifying material  remediable problems and reducing uncertainties generally  through the year project described above 
the company s evaluation is on going and it expects that new and different information will become available to it as that evaluation continues 
as a result  the company has no reasonable basis to conclude that the year problem will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its cash requirements from cash generated from operations  the sale of equity securities  bank lines of credit and long term and short term debt 
the company s principal sources of liquidity as of june  consisted of approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company also has approximately million in lines of credit with taiwanese financial institutions  all of which was available at june  additionally  approximately million in lines of credit exist with a japanese financial institution  all of which was available at june  in fiscal  operating activities used net cash of approximately million 
the company s net loss of approximately million was offset by reduction in accounts receivable and inventories of million  as well as the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization of million  in process research and development write offs of million  and deferred taxes of million 
investing activities utilized cash of approximately million primarily due to the viewpoint and xli acquisitions million  net of cash acquired and additions to property  plant and equipment of million 
the proceeds of the sale of the company s investment in the uicc foundry were used to purchase additional short term investments 
borrowings under the company s line of credit in japan were paid in full as of june  and resulted in a net million use of cash during fiscal additionally  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock in fiscal  for a total of approximately million 
in july  the company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire xionics document technologies  inc under the terms of the agreement  which is subject to approval by the shareholders of both companies  the company would issue approximately million shares of common stock and approximately million in cash to acquire all of the common stock of xionics 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and credit facilities will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital and to fund necessary purchases of property and equipment  the xionics acquisition  and any other investments it may make through at least the next twelve months 
if  however  during the next to month period the company fails to increase its revenue or is unable to reduce its expenses below its revenues  then the company may be in a position where it will need to seek additional financing 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek other financing sooner or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
the company may also utilize cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
however  the company has no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies  other than the xionics acquisition noted above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk most of the company s foreign sales are negotiated in us dollars  however  invoicing is often done in local currency 
as a result  the company may be subject to the risks of currency fluctuations 
assets and liabilities which are denominated in non functional currencies are remeasured into the functional currency on a monthly basis and the resulting gain or loss is recorded within non operating income in the statement of operations 
many of the company s non functional currency receivables and payables are hedged through managing net asset positions  product pricing and other means 
the company s strategy is to minimize its non functional currency net assets or net liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries 
the company s policy is not to speculate in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuations  trade in currencies for which there are not underlying exposures  or enter into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 
as of june  and  the company had foreign currency exchange contracts to exchange yen for approximately  and  respectively 
the company uses financial instruments  including local currency debt arrangements  to offset the gains or losses of the financial instruments against gains or losses on the underlying operations cash flows or investments 
if foreign currency rates fluctuate by from rates at june  and  the effect on the company s consolidated financial statements would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect its interest income and the fair values of its investments 
the company manages the exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluation of its investment portfolio and investing in short term investment grade corporate securities and us government and other agencies obligations which mature with the next months 
in addition  the company does not use investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
due to the short maturities of its investments  the carrying value approximates the fair value 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june  and  the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
further  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows
