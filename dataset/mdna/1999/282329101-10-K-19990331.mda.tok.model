item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included under item of this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements relating to future events or financial results  such as statements indicating that we believe  we expect  we anticipate or we intend certain events may occur or certain trends may continue  that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should not rely too heavily on these statements  although they reflect the good faith judgment of our management  we can only base such statements on facts and factors that we currently know 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
general we are an internet retailer selling retail and wholesale goods to businesses  resellers and consumers 
we sell merchandise under two formats onsale atauction  and  commencing in january  onsale atcost 
onsale atauction 
onsale atauction is an interactive online auction designed to serve as an efficient and entertaining marketing channel for products that are typically unavailable through conventional distribution channels 
through atauction  we sell excess merchandise and services  including refurbished and close out products  over the web to businesses  resellers and consumers 
merchandise and services sold on the atauction site include personal computers  consumer electronics  sports and fitness equipment and vacation packages 
standard auctions typically run for to hours 
in may  we introduced the express auction  a compressed version of our standard auction 
express auctions typically run one hour  enabling us to increase the number of auctions opened and closed during the week 
we also introduced quick buy in the second quarter of quick buy provides a specific quantity of product to purchase at a fixed price 
onsale atcost 
we introduced onsale atcost in january through atcost  we offer businesses  resellers and consumers a broad selection of new computers and computer related products for sale at prices equal to the amount invoiced by our vendors  plus charges for transaction  payment processing and shipping fees and taxes where appropriate 
for the period from our inception in july to december   our operating activities consisted primarily of recruiting personnel  purchasing operating assets  establishing vendor relationships and developing the computer infrastructure necessary to conduct auctions on the internet 
during that period  we had total revenue of  we achieved profitability in the first quarter of and increased our total revenue and net income in each quarter of however  in early we elected to expand our operations  including increasing our staffing and marketing efforts  which resulted in higher operating expenses and net losses in the final three quarters of and throughout we expect to continue to expand our operations and efforts to create brand loyalty  including advertising of both the atauction and atcost formats  and therefore  we expect to experience net losses through at least the first half of through  our revenue consisted of merchandise revenue and commission and other revenue 
merchandise revenue  also referred to as principal sales  represents sales of merchandise acquired by us on a purchase or consignment basis where we charge the customer s credit card and either we or the vendor ships the merchandise to the customer 
commission and other revenue is comprised of commissions on agent sales where the supplier charges and ships the product to the customer  commissions on the onsale exchange transactions person to person auctions included through september  and advertising revenue 
for a discussion of the operation of each model  the risks that we bear under each model and the recognition of revenue for each  see note of notes to financial statements 
gross merchandise sales represent what our total revenue would have been if all agent sales and the onsale exchange transactions had been made as principal sales 
we believe that the information on gross merchandise sales is relevant to a reader of our financial statements because it enables a comparison between historical periods and a more accurate comparison to future periods than does total revenue 
gross merchandise sales should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in september  we agreed to transfer the onsale exchange  our person to person auction site service to yahoo 
as part of this agreement  we retained the responsibility for running the auctions and processing the transactions  and in return we receive a share of the advertising revenues generated from the yahoo auction web site 
although our future revenue will not include transactions from the onsale exchange  this should not have a significant impact on our financial statements due to the low volume of sales and significantly lower commission rates associated with these transactions 
results of operations revenue the following tables reconcile total revenue to gross merchandise sales and set forth the composition of gross merchandise sales for the three years ended december   and change change over over in thousands total revenue    plus gross commission and other revenue    less net commission and other revenue    gross merchandise sales 
   of gross merchandise sales in thousands merchandise revenue principal sales purchased inventory    consigned inventory    total merchandise revenue    gross commission and other revenue    gross merchandise sales 
   sources of revenue growth 
the increases in total revenue and gross merchandise sales were due to investments in marketing programs designed to promote and maintain awareness of the onsale brand  growth in our customer base and increases in the amount and types of merchandise obtained from vendors 
additionally  we increased the number of times we open and close auctions in a week from three at the end of  to five at the end of and to seven in the first quarter of we also added quick buy and express auctions in the second quarter of we introduced the onsale exchange in the fourth quarter of  but we transferred it to yahoo at the end of the third quarter of our transfer of the onsale exchange to yahoo should not have a significant impact on our financial statements due to the low volume of sales and significantly lower commission rates associated with these transactions 
constraints on revenue growth 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced difficulties obtaining merchandise for sale through atauction due to a limited supply of inventory available from our computer products vendors 
these supply constraints resulted in fourth quarter sales growth of over the third quarter of  which was substantially lower than the growth rates in recent quarters 
we cannot assure you that product availability for the atauction site will improve in future quarters 
principal vs 
agent sales 
the portion of our gross merchandise sales represented by merchandise revenue increased from in  to in and to in  primarily due to increased sales of purchased inventory  because we believed that we had the potential to provide better customer service and to achieve higher gross margins over time by controlling the purchase of merchandise 
as we note under gross profit below  we have experienced low gross margins on purchased inventory 
we are currently working with consignment and agent suppliers to establish standard customer service terms for sale of their products through atauction 
we believe this will enable us to increase our fixed margin consignment inventory and agent sales over time 
gross profit gross profit is total revenue less cost of revenue 
cost of merchandise revenue consists primarily of the cost of the merchandise sold to customers and shipping costs net of shipping and handling revenue 
commission and other revenue have minimal related cost of revenue 
prior to  credit card fees were included as a cost of revenue 
to provide a better comparison with similar companies reporting practices  we reclassified credit card fees to selling and marketing expenses for and credit card fees represented approximately  and of total revenue for the years ended  and  respectively 
gross profit dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increases in gross profit dollars were due to the increased sales over the last three years 
gross profit in included a first quarter charge of  for certain unreconciled merchandise adjustments and additional reserves related to customer returns 
gross profit for total merchandise revenue and for gross commission and other revenue on a gross merchandise sales basis excluding the first quarter charge for unreconciled merchandise adjustments and additional reserves for customer returns for  and was in millions of dollars amount margin amount margin amount margin total merchandise revenue gross commission and other revenue gross margin on merchandise revenue decreased in from primarily due to lower margins associated with sales of our computer products purchased inventory 
gross margin on commission and other revenue increased in primarily due to increased advertising revenue  which has a very low cost  partially offset by a decrease in agent sales transactions 
additionally  in september  we transferred the onsale exchange service which we had initiated in the fourth quarter of to yahoo  therefore  we did not record any transactions from the onsale exchange in the fourth quarter of transactions from the onsale exchange during the fourth quarter of and for the first three quarters of typically generated significantly lower margins for us compared to other transactions 
gross margin on merchandise revenue was higher in as compared with due to a one time charge in of  related to our shift in contract warehouses 
the increase in gross margin on commission and other revenue from to was primarily attributable to our ability to negotiate more favorable terms with vendors as we grew in size and  to a lesser extent  to us beginning to sell advertising  which has little cost of revenue associated with it 
operating expenses our operating expenses have increased significantly since our inception as a result of our expansion 
operating expenses include recruiting of personnel  development of our infrastructure  and increased efforts to expand and market our brand and auction services 
we believe that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we expand our operations and promote our brand name 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenditures  payroll and related expenses for sales  customer service  marketing and merchandise acquisition personnel  credit card fees and promotional material 
these expenses represented  and of total revenue for  and  respectively 
these increases in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue primarily represent a full year of expenses associated with our internet advertising program initiated in the third quarter of and  to a lesser degree  these increases reflect additions to our marketing staff and other promotional and marketing expenses 
we reclassified prior years customer service expenses from general and administrative expenses to sales and marketing expenses to conform to current year s presentation 
customer service expenses represented  and of total operating expenses for the years ended  and  respectively 
we also reclassified and credit card fees from cost of revenue to sales and marketing expenses as discussed under gross profit 
credit card fees represented  and of total operating expenses for  and  respectively 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollars as we continue to enhance our brand recognition through our marketing and advertising programs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive  accounting and logistical personnel  bad debt expense  facilities expenses  recruiting and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses represented  and of total revenue  respectively  for  and the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue in was due to our leveraging relatively fixed expenses with a higher volume of sales 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in as compared with was due to increases in salaries and related costs  primarily as a result of the hiring of additional personnel  infrastructure development  additional professional fees required of a public company and expenses related to reserves established in connection with non recurring potential expenses related to suppliers 
we expect the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses to increase in  as we expand staff and facilities and reflect expenses for the entire year for the personnel added in engineering 
engineering expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for engineering personnel and consultants who develop  enhance  manage  operate and monitor our web site and related systems  as well as related equipment costs 
engineering expenses represented  and of total revenue  respectively  for  and the dollar increases in engineering expenses in each of these periods were primarily attributable to increased staffing and associated costs relating to enhancing the features and functionality of our web site and related systems 
prior to  all engineering costs were expensed as incurred 
in  we adopted the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop and  accordingly  capitalized certain engineering costs related to internally developed software 
in  we capitalized approximately million of software of which  was related to engineering costs for internally developed software 
we expect the dollar amount of engineering expenses to increase in the future as we continue to add staff to maintain  enhance and modify our web site and other systems 
equity in net loss of joint venture on may   we entered into a joint venture agreement with softbank corporation to perform on line auctions for the japanese market  resulting in the formation of onsale japan kk  which commenced operations in the third quarter of we own a interest in the joint venture and account for our interest using the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  we recognize our share of net profits or losses of the joint venture as an adjustment to our initial investment amount 
our share of the net loss of the joint venture was  during interest and other income  net our interest and other income  net  was million   and  respectively  for  and the increase in interest and other income  net  over the last three years was due to increased cash balances resulting from our initial public offering in april  which netted proceeds of approximately million  and our secondary offering in october  which netted proceeds of approximately million 
income taxes we had net losses of and million  respectively  for the years ended and and thus no provision for income taxes was recorded for or for  we generated income before income taxes of  and recorded a provision for income taxes of  representing an effective income tax rate of 
this effective tax rate was below the statutory rate primarily because we utilized our net operating loss carryforwards from the prior period 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately million  which expire beginning in see note of notes to financial statements 
fluctuations in operating results our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future  due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
see risk factors our operating results fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict 
liquidity and capital resources cash inflows and outflows financing activities 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in april  through which we netted proceeds of approximately million  the sale of our common stock in a secondary offering in october  through which we netted proceeds of approximately million  the private sale of series a preferred stock and warrants for approximately million in september  and the sale of million of series b preferred stock pursuant to the exercise of the warrants in march net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in represents the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and issuances pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in resulted almost entirely from proceeds received from our public stock offerings and from the exercise of warrants and employee stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities in  million  resulted from the sale of series a preferred stock and certain warrants to a venture capital group 
operating activities 
net cash provided by used in in operating activities was approximately  and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the net cash used in operating activities in was primarily attributable to our net loss from operations of million  an increase in merchandise inventory of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million as we improved our payment terms with vendors  an increase in accrued expenses of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
net cash used in operating activities in was primarily due to the operating loss of million  increased inventories and accounts receivable of and million  respectively  partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses of million 
net cash provided in was primarily due to increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue of and million  respectively  partially offset by a million increase in inventory 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities of million during reflects our net investment of excess cash in short term marketable securities  million at december   and investment of million in property and equipment including fixtures and equipment for our new corporate headquarters and california warehouse  continued investment in hardware required for our web site  a new financial software package and other software that we developed for internal use 
during and  our investments related solely to the purchase of property and equipment 
during  we funded our initial investment in our joint venture with softbank corporation of million through an unsecured note payable denominated in us dollars to softbank corporation 
the principal and accrued interest thereon is due the earlier of the closing date on an initial public offering of the joint venture or december  with interest accruing at a fluctuating rate equal to the short term prime rate of the dai ichi kangyo bank in tokyo  japan as of december  
this note has no right of offset against our investment in the joint venture 
cash  cash equivalents and commitments cash and cash equivalents 
as of december  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term available for sale investments 
commitments 
as of december  o our principal commitment was an obligation of approximately million under operating leases for our corporate headquarters 
o we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  but we anticipate purchasing approximately million of property and equipment during  primarily for computer and office equipment 
o we have certain sponsorship agreements which allow us to appear as the auction sponsor on specific web sites 
these agreements require future payments of up to million and under certain circumstances incremental fees based on the volume of traffic to our web site 
these agreements expire at various times from march to december as a result of our intention to offer credit to certain customers in the future and because of our rapid growth  we may require additional cash to support the anticipated growth in accounts receivable 
we expect our operating expenses to increase as we continue to expand our marketing efforts  increase our staffing  increase our software development efforts  and grow our infrastructure 
as a result  we expect to experience quarterly net losses through at least the first half of  and thus we may need to finance our increased inventory  accounts receivable  capital expenditures and some portion of our operating expenses from our current cash and cash equivalents balance 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balance will meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may consider alternative financing  such as issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities or obtaining further credit facilities  if market conditions make such alternatives financially attractive for funding our expansion 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
impact of the year issue background 
the year issue refers generally to the problems that some software may have in determining the correct century for the year 
for example  software with date sensitive functions that are not year compliant may not be able to distinguish whether means or  which may result in failures or the creation of erroneous results 
readiness 
we have completed assessment of all internal systems 
our assessment included information technology systems such as business systems  web site operations systems  infrastructure and support systems as well as non information technology systems such as our security system  building and telephone equipment  and embedded microcontrollers 
our accounting system and internally developed systems are year compliant 
we are testing all systems to ensure that they will be available and operational 
all testing and remediation efforts are expected to be completed by june  in addition  we are seeking and will continue to seek assurances from vendors and other third parties with whom we do business that they are on target for completing their own year remediation 
risks 
our most likely worst case scenario would be dispersed  intermittent telecommunications problems experienced by local internet service providers and their users throughout the country and world  preventing those customers from being able to access our web site 
this could be combined with  or result from  intermittent power problems which could cause similar problems with accessing the web site 
additionally  many customers may be using older systems which may not be year compliant  and this would prevent them from accessing our web site 
under this worst case scenario  we would continue operations  but our web site would be inaccessible to the individuals or groups affected by these problems 
if our credit card processors are not year compliant  we will not be able to process credit card sales 
if our vendors are not year compliant  we will not be able to obtain products from our vendors or our vendors may not be able to ship products sold to our customers 
in the event of this worst case scenario  we could lose significant revenues from customers unable to purchase from the site  be unable to ensure delivery of products to customers  incur expenses to repair our systems  face interruptions in the work of our employees  lose advertising revenue and suffer damage to our reputation 
estimated year costs 
we estimate our total costs for ensuring year compliance for all internal systems to be minimal 
costs incurred through december  in connection with year compliance projects have not been material 
we will incur additional amounts related to the year plan for administrative expenses associated with confirming compliance by outside parties  outside contractor assistance  product engineering and customer satisfaction 
we have funded our year plan from operating cash flows 
contingency planning 
we are developing a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if we are unable to achieve year readiness of our critical operations 
we are also subject to external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as utility or transportation company year compliance failures and related service interruptions and we make no guarantees with regards to these external forces and their impact on our operations 
new accounting pronouncements in april  the aicpa issued sop  which provides guidance for determining whether computer software is internal use software and on accounting for the proceeds of computer software originally developed or obtained for internal use and then subsequently sold to the public 
it also provides guidance on capitalization of the costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
we adopted sop in risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this form k before investing in our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks that we are aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may become important factors that affect our business 
if any of the following risks occur  or if others occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our short operating history makes our business difficult to evaluate 
we founded onsale in july and began conducting auctions on the internet in may accordingly  there is a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
in january  we initiated a new business  titled onsale atcost  to complement our existing onsale atauction business 
our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as electronic commerce 
these risks include those set forth below 
to address these risks  we must  among other things o continue to expand our vendor channels and buyer resources  o manage product obsolescence and pricing risks  o maintain our customer base and attract significant numbers of new customers  o respond to competitive developments  o implement and execute our business strategy successfully  and o continue to develop and upgrade our technologies and retailing services 
we may not successfully implement all or any of our business strategies or successfully address the risks and uncertainties that we encounter  and if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 
further  in view of our recent formation of onsale atcost  the rapidly evolving nature of our business in general and our limited operating history overall  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we expect net losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses in each of and  and we expect to experience substantial quarterly net losses through the first half of we base this expectation in part on the following o we expect the formation and operation of onsale atcost to lead to increased operating expenses 
we cannot assure you that consumers will accept the atcost format or that the volume generated from this format will cover the increased operating costs 
o we expect our operating expenses will continue to increase as we expend financial and management resources on marketing 
for instance  we launched a significant advertising campaign in the first quarter of we must continue to expand our marketing efforts to enhance our brand image  increase our visibility on other companies high traffic web sites  purchase larger volumes of merchandise  increase the size of our staff and support our growing infrastructure 
our operating expenses will also continue to increase as we increase the size of our staff  purchase larger volumes of merchandise and continue to support our growing infrastructure 
o our atauction business has relatively low operating margins  and the transaction fee pricing model on which atcost is based may produce lower gross margins than atauction 
the profitability of atcost may therefore depend on generating a higher volume of transactions compared with atauction 
because atcost is new  we are unable to predict what revenues and margins atcost will produce  and therefore whether and to what extent atcost will achieve profitability 
to the extent that increases in operating expenses are not matched by increased revenue  our business  operating results and financial condition will be harmed 
our operating results fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future  due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include o our ability to attract new atauction customers and to retain our repeat customers  o our ability to generate increased transaction volumes with our new atcost business  o the degree to which our new atcost business cuts into our existing atauction business  o our ability to manage our inventory mix and the mix of products offered for auction  meet our pricing targets and take other actions required to maintain customer satisfaction  o our ability to maximize gross margins  o the availability and pricing of merchandise from vendors  o the timing  cost and availability of advertising on web sites comparable to ours and over other media  o the amount and timing of costs relating to expansion of our operations  o the announcement or introduction of new types of merchandise  service offerings or customer services by us or our competitors  o delays in revenue recognition at the end of a fiscal period as a result of shipping or logistical problems  o delays in shipments as a result of strikes or other problems with our delivery service providers or the loss of our credit card processor  and o general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the internet and electronic commerce 
due to the foregoing factors and factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  in some future quarter our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  and in such event the trading price of our common stock may decline 
we experience seasonality in our business 
we have experienced and may continue to experience seasonality in our business 
in the fourth quarter of  our computer product revenue declined due to seasonally limited availability of excess and refurbished goods during the main holiday season 
the availability of excess and refurbished goods  which is critical to our atauction business  typically runs counter to normal selling cycles 
moreover  internet usage in general may be subject to seasonal fluctuations 
if these seasonal fluctuations occur  our operating results may fluctuate accordingly 
we are in an extremely competitive market 
existing competitors 
the electronic commerce market  particularly over the internet  is new  rapidly evolving and extremely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we currently or potentially compete with a variety of other companies who either offer the same types of merchandise and or provide the same or a similar type of sales format to customers  including those listed under business competition 
many of these current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to secure merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms than we obtain  and they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their merchandise than we can 
new competitors 
electronic commerce is characterized by low barriers to entry 
moreover  our current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or directly with vendors to obtain exclusive or semi exclusive sources of merchandise 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors and vendors may emerge and rapidly acquire marketshare 
in addition  manufacturers might elect to liquidate their products directly 
increased competition may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and a diminished brand franchise 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our revenues  web site traffic levels or click throughs relative to our current and potential competitors 
if competition increases and our branding efforts are not successful  our business will be harmed 
if we cannot continue to build strong brand loyalty  our business will be harmed 
we believe that development and awareness of the onsale brand is critical to our success in attracting consumers and advertisers 
furthermore  we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will increase as low barriers to entry encourage the proliferation of web sites 
if we are unsuccessful in continuing to build strong brand loyalty  our business will be harmed 
in order to attract and retain consumers and advertisers  and to promote and maintain the onsale brand in response to competitive pressures  we intend to increase our marketing and advertising spending  including campaigns in traditional forms of media such as television 
we believe that advertising rates  and the cost of any online advertising campaigns that we conduct in particular  could increase substantially in the future 
despite our efforts  we cannot assure you that consumers or advertisers will perceive our web site and or the onsale brand as superior to the web sites and or brands of our competitors 
we may encounter new risks associated with our new business offerings and international expansion 
risks of new offerings 
we are continually introducing new lines of business in order to diversify our business offerings  including most recently our new onsale atcost business and our international joint venture with softbank corporation 
general risks associated with diversifying our business offerings include dilution of the onsale brand  lack of customer interest and vendor dissatisfaction 
we may be exposed to additional risks associated with these new opportunities that we have not yet identified 
if we are unable to identify and address these risks  our business will be harmed 
risks of international expansion 
expansions of our business into international markets face additional risks 
electronic commerce over the internet in general  and our services in particular  may not gain broad market acceptance in international markets 
we may experience difficulty in managing international operations as a result of competition  technical problems  local laws and regulations  distance  and language and cultural differences 
there are also certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  including o the general risk that we may invest time and money into such expansion without success  o cultural and business practice differences  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o political risks and legal and economic instability  o difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  o potentially longer payment cycles  o difficulties in obtaining us export licenses o the introduction of non tariff barriers and higher duty rates  o higher costs of enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights  o seasonal reductions in business activity in certain other parts of the world  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
one or more of these factors might have a material adverse effect on our current or future international operations  and consequently on our business overall 
we face risks associated with purchasing and carrying our own inventory 
we currently purchase a large majority of our merchandise from vendors  rather than having our vendors ship merchandise as each sale occurs  and we expect our purchased inventory to continue to account for a large majority of our total gross merchandise sales in the future 
accordingly  we inherit the risks of carrying our own inventory  including o potential declines in the market value of the refurbished and excess goods that we purchase  o managing customer returns and credits associated with merchandise to be returned to vendors  o shrinkage resulting from theft  loss or misrecording of inventory  and o unpredictable sale prices due to the nature of our auction process 
we depend on third parties for fulfillment of our purchased inventory 
we use gage marketing group  our contract warehouse  to fulfill approximately of purchased inventory sales 
we also use united parcel service as our delivery service for substantially all of our products 
we have limited control over these third parties and we have no long term relationships with any of them 
if we are unable to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with such third parties on acceptable commercial terms  or if the quality of products and services by such third parties falls below a satisfactory standard  our business could be harmed 
we rely on merchandise vendors for supply  shipping and quality of products 
supply 
we are entirely dependent upon vendors to supply us with merchandise for sale through onsale atauction and onsale atcost 
in  approximately of our total sales over our online auctions were derived from merchandise acquired from the five most significant vendors for that year and one vendor accounted for of total sales 
we have no long term contracts or arrangements with our vendors that guarantee the availability of merchandise 
moreover  we must develop distributor relationships to supply the necessary volume of products for our new atcost business 
we cannot assure you that our current vendors will continue to supply merchandise for sale through atauction or that we will be able to establish new vendor relationships that will ensure that merchandise will be available for atauction or atcost 
customer service shipping and quality of products returns 
although we purchase a large majority of our inventory  we also rely on some of our vendors to ship merchandise directly to customers 
consequently  we have limited control over the goods shipped by these vendors  and at times these shipments have been subject to delays 
also  despite the fact that most merchandise that we have sold carries either a manufacturer s or vendor s warranty  and we are not obligated to accept merchandise returns  we in fact have accepted returns from customers for which we did not receive reimbursements from our manufacturers or vendors 
if the quality of service provided by such vendors falls below a satisfactory standard or if our level of returns exceeds our expectations  this could have a harmful effect on our business 
we depend on relationships with other online companies 
we currently depend  and to some extent we are increasing our dependence  on our agreements with other online companies for advertising  promotional placements and sponsorships 
these agreements are short term and none provide for guaranteed renewal 
the risks associated with this dependence include o uncertainty whether significant spending on these relationships will increase our revenues substantially  at all  or within the time periods that we expect  o the possibility that space on other web sites or the same sites may increase in price or cease to be available on reasonable terms or at all  and o the possibility that a competitor will purchase exclusive rights to attractive space on key sites 
we depend on other third parties for the operation of our business 
in addition to the merchandise vendors and online companies described above  we also depend on several third parties in conducting our operations  including the following o we do not own a gateway onto the internet  but instead rely on an internet service provider to connect our web site to the internet  o our internally developed auction software depends on operating system  database and server software that has been developed  produced by and licensed from third parties  and o wells fargo bank  through its relationship with first data corporation  is our sole processor of credit card transactions 
we have limited control over these third parties and we have no long term relationships with any of them 
if we are unable to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with such third parties on acceptable commercial terms  or if the quality of products and services by such third parties falls below a satisfactory standard  our business could be harmed 
also  our loss of or inability to maintain or obtain upgrades to certain of our technology licenses could result in delays in developing our systems until equivalent technology could be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated 
our business may face increased government regulation 
auctioneering and other laws in other states 
several states have laws that regulate auctions and auction companies within their jurisdiction 
we are currently subject to auctioneering laws in the state of california  but other states may interpret their statutes to apply to our transactions with consumers in such states 
the burdens of complying with auctioneering laws in other states could materially increase our cost of doing business 
similarly  other states may construe their existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  sales tax  libel and personal privacy to apply to internet companies servicing consumers within their boundaries 
resolution of whether or how such laws will be applied is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
tax laws 
the tax treatment of the internet and electronic commerce is currently unsettled 
a number of proposals have been made at the federal  state and local level and by certain foreign governments that could impose taxes on the sale of goods and services and certain other internet activities 
recently  the internet tax information act was signed into law  placing a three year moratorium on new state and local taxes on internet commerce 
our business may be harmed by the passage of laws in the future imposing taxes or other burdensome regulations on internet commerce 
new internet laws 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet generally  covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
similarly  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business over the internet 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of commerce over the internet  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a harmful effect on our business 
internet access fees 
certain local telephone carriers have asserted that the increasing popularity and use of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure  and that many areas with high internet use have begun to experience interruptions in telephone service 
these carriers have petitioned the federal communications commission to impose access fees on internet service providers and online service providers 
if such access fees are imposed  the costs of communicating on the internet could increase substantially  potentially slowing the increasing use of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for our services or increase our cost of doing business and thus have a harmful effect our business 
we may have to qualify to do business in other jurisdictions 
as our service is available over the internet in multiple states and foreign countries  and as we sell to numerous consumers resident in such states and foreign countries  such jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each such state and foreign country 
we are qualified to do business in only three states  and our failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties 
we could face liability or a decrease in business if a breach of security occurs 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks continues to be a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to affect secure transmission of confidential information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect customer transaction data 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
to the extent that our activities or those of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or possible liability 
moreover  any well publicized breach of security could deter use of the internet  and the web in particular  as a means to conduct commercial transactions 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our business could be harmed 
we expect to continue to expand our operations  and in order to manage this growth we face the following challenges o improving existing and implementing new operational  financial and inventory systems  procedures and controls  o integrating our new key managerial and technical employees into our existing management team  o training  motivating and managing our growing employee base  and identifying the personnel required to continue to grow our employee base  and o managing the risks associated with accounts receivable expansion and collection if and when we begin offering credit to certain customers that have been approved as having an appropriate credit rating 
we depend on our key employees 
our future performance depends upon the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key personnel 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and we maintain no key person life insurance 
competition for attracting and retaining personnel in our industry is intense  especially in our geographic location in the san francisco bay area  and we may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to succeed in the future 
if one or more of our key personnel leaves us and or joins or forms a competitor  this could have a harmful effect on our business 
the electronic commerce industry can change rapidly 
the market for internet products and services is characterized by rapid technological developments  evolving industry standards and consumer demands  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements that could render our existing web site technology and services obsolete 
these market characteristics are exacerbated by the emerging nature of the market and the fact that many companies are expected to introduce new internet products and services in the near future 
moreover  the widespread adoption of developing multimedia enabling technologies could require fundamental and costly changes in our own technology 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond to technological advances  emerging industry standards and new market demands on a timely and cost effective basis 
we depend on continued improvements in the internet infrastructure and in our own systems 
growth of the internet generally 
our success depends in large part on the development of the internet infrastructure and related enabling technologies  performance improvements and security measures for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet could suffer from performance problems or outages due to continued growth in internet users and their bandwidth requirements and due to other problems such as the year issue 
any of these problems could lead to decreased usage or growth in usage of our web site 
also  our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to consumers and to increase the scope of such services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the internet 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our services is dependent on future improvements to the entire internet 
growth of our own systems in particular 
our revenues depend upon the number of visitors who use our web site and the volume of orders we fulfill in atauction and atcost 
we use an internally developed system for our web site and several aspects of transaction processing  including billing  shipping and tracking 
we may be required to add additional hardware and software and further develop and upgrade our existing technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic on our web site and increased sales volume through our transaction processing systems 
any failure to do so may cause unanticipated systems disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer service  impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment or delays in reporting accurate financial information 
we are subject to risks of system failure 
substantially all of our communications hardware and computer hardware is located at a leased facility in menlo park  california 
our systems are vulnerable to damage from earthquake  fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
we do not presently have fully redundant systems and have not yet completed implementing a formal disaster recovery plan 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins  attempts by third parties deliberately to exceed the capacity of our systems and similar disruptive problems 
our coverage limits on our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property 
our performance and ability to compete are dependent on a significant degree on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  which include the following o our proprietary technology o our registered us trademarks and our other trade and service marks  and o our domain names  each of which relates to our brand 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  regulations governing domain names  confidentiality agreements and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights  and our inability or failure to do so could result in dilution of the onsale brand and other loss of competitive and commercial advantages that we hold 
see business intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
additionally  we may choose to litigate to protect our intellectual property rights  which could result in a significant cost of resources and money to us 
we cannot assure success in any such litigation that we might undertake 
we face litigation risks 
intellectual property rights 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or trademarks or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
furthermore  our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  and we have in the past received  and may in the future receive  notices from third parties claiming infringement by our software or other aspects of our business 
any such claims  with or without merit  could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources and management attention  and could require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if litigation is successful against us  this could result in invalidation of our proprietary rights and or significant liability for damages  which could have a harmful effect on our business 
products liability 
our sale of products through our atauction and atcost services could subject us to product liability claims  and states and other jurisdictions other than california may interpret their products liability laws to apply to internet commerce providers such as us that enter into transactions with their residents 
while we carry liability insurance  it may not be adequate to fully compensate for substantial claims  and these claims could have a harmful effect on our business 
liability for information transmitted over our online services 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through our services is currently unsettled 
claims could be made against us under both united states and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose such liability on other online services companies are currently pending 
in addition  legislation has been proposed that imposes liability for  or prohibits the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
the potential imposition of liability on online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services could require us to alter our service offerings 
consumer acceptance of the internet as a viable market for our goods is uncertain 
the market for the sale of goods over the internet  particularly through online auctions  is still in a development stage and is rapidly changing 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty  and there exist few proven services and products 
since the market for our auctions is still relatively new and evolving  and the market for our atcost products is new  it is difficult to predict the size of this market or its future growth rate  if any 
moreover  the success of our auctions will depend upon continued growth of the internet as a medium for commerce by a broad base of consumers and vendors 
we cannot assure you that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will adopt and continue to use the internet as a medium for commerce generally or for the types of products that we offer in particular 
additionally  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  such as ease of access  security  reliability  cost and quality of service  remain unresolved and may affect the growth of internet use or the attractiveness of conducting commerce online 
our ownership by a small number of stockholders could discourage  delay or prevent our acquisition by another company 
our officers  directors and greater than stockholders and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march as a result  such persons  acting together  will have the ability to control our management and affairs and to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including elections and removal of directors and a merger or sale of the company 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of inhibiting  delaying or preventing a change in control  merger or sale of the company  which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of the shares of our common stock has been  and is likely to be  highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors  such as o actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  o announcements of technological innovations  o new sales formats by us or our competitors  o developments with respect to patents  copyrights or proprietary rights  o changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  o conditions and trends in the internet and electronic commerce industries  and o adoption of new accounting standards affecting the retail sales industry 
further  the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
the trading prices of many technology companies stocks  including our common stock  are at or near historical highs and reflect price earnings ratios substantially above historical levels 
these market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation against several companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in diversion of our management s attention and resources and substantial financial costs
