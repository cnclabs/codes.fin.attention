item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ansoft corporation ansoft or the company develops  markets and supports electronic design automation eda software based on fundamental electromagnetic principles 
the company s software is used by engineers in the design of high performance electronic devices and systems  such as cellular phones  communications systems  computer circuit boards and motors 
as the marketplace demands higher levels of system performance and miniaturization  the need to model accurately the electromagnetic interaction in communications  computer devices and electromechanical components and systems is becoming increasingly important  yet traditional eda tools do not provide accurate modeling of electromagnetic interaction 
by using the company s software  companies can more easily predict electromagnetic interaction in such systems and components  thus reducing time to market and simultaneously lowering design and manufacturing costs 
the company s products are used by design engineers in a wide range of industries  particularly the rapidly evolving wireless communications and rf radio frequency markets as well as the semiconductor  computer  automotive and consumer electronics industries

effects of inflation to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s consolidated financial results 
recent accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company does not expect this pronouncement to impact the consolidated financial statements because the company has not entered into derivative or hedging transactions 
year issues the company has recently evaluated the products the company currently supports to determine if they are year ready 
most of the company s products do not rely on knowledge of the date date sensitive data for performance or functionality 
the company s products only use date sensitive data with respect to the licensing of the company s products 
state of readiness 
the results of this evaluation revealed that most of the company s supported products are year ready 
the company plans to offer patches or upgrades to the supported products currently not year ready 
during  an evaluation of the company s internal support systems was done to determine if they are year ready to support the company s operations beyond the year the company currently uses third party software systems and applications  some of which are not year ready 
the company has the intention to stop using these software products or upgrade or replace them as part of the company s growth plans 
although the company s intention was to replace or upgrade these systems prior to june   the work will be extended to december  the failure by the company to complete such work prior to december  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operations 
costs 
the company does not have a project tracking system that tracks the cost and time that its own internal employees spend on the year project 
based on the company s assessment  the cost incurred to date has not had a material impact to the company s results of operations 
the company expects that costs directly related to year in excess of normal upgrade and maintenance costs would not exceed approximately  for both costs incurred to date and future costs 
however  there is no assurance that the costs may not exceed this amount 
risks 
the company is requesting its vendors to provide year compliance certificates for all its internal support systems 
however  the company only intends to perform testing on its critical internal support systems 
inoperability related to year problems of internal systems that are certified year ready by the vendor and not tested by the company could have an adverse impact to the company s operational efficiency 
the patches or upgrades provided by the company as the remedies to make its products year ready may not be accepted by the customer  which could have an adverse impact on the company s business 
the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year readiness 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  the company does not have any meaningful data as to the state of its customers year readiness 
contingency plans 
the company does not presently have a contingency plan for handling year problems that are not detected and corrected prior to their occurrences 
upon completion of testing and implementation activities  the company will be able to assess the areas requiring contingency planning and expects to develop appropriate planning at that time 
any failure of the company to address any unforeseen year problems could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio 
the company mitigates its risk by diversifying its investments among high credit quality securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures 
foreign currency risk 
the company transacts business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of april   the company had no hedging contracts outstanding 
the company assesses the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis
