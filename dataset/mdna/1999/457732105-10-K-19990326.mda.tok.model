year issues inspire is continuing its assessment of year issues and taking steps to prevent these issues from adversely affecting its future operating results 
this readiness process includes  but is not limited to  preparing an inventory of potential year issues  determining functions affected  performing remediation as necessary  developing testing and recording results 
in its assessment of year issues  inspire is specifically focusing on its software applications and associated software products  hardware  facilities  communications equipment and security systems 
inspire has not yet completed its year compliance testing of  and remediation efforts on  if necessary  these items 
there can be no assurance that these items will be year compliant by december  if any of these items are not year compliant by december   then the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of inspire 
inspire has  however  made upgrades to its facilities  communications equipment  and security systems that  it believes  will make them completely operational after december  in addition to evaluating its own systems for year compliance  inspire is also communicating with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which interfaces with such entities are vulnerable to year issues and the extent to which any products purchased by or from  or internal systems of  such entities are vulnerable to year issues 
there can be no assurance that such entities  or interfaces with or products purchased from such entities  will not be vulnerable to year issues or that such vulnerability will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of inspire 
total costs associated with inspire s year readiness process  consisting of both internal and external resources  are expected to range between and million 
inspire anticipates financing these costs with cash generated from operations 
inspire has not yet fully completed its year assessment and remediation efforts 
the estimated time to complete assessment  testing and full compliance is june  inspire will develop contingency plans as it finds that  through compliance testing  any of its applications  products  hardware  facilities  communication equipment or security systems are not year compliant or that any of its significant suppliers or customers are significantly vulnerable to year issues  and that such noncompliance or vulnerability cannot be remedied in a timely manner

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inspire maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of government and corporate bonds purchased with an average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities include both fixed and floating rate securities 
the fixed rate securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decrease by an immaterial amount 
inspire generally has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity 
the floating rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk and may produce less interest income than expected if interest rates decrease 
inspire does not expect its financial position  results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the portfolio 
other than these short term investments  inspire does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and does not purchase as investments  as hedges  or for purposes other than trading instruments that are likely to expose inspire to market risk  whether it be from interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk 
inspire has issued no debt instruments  entered into no forward or futures contracts  purchased no options and entered into no swaps
