as the internet becomes an increasingly significant global medium for business to business and business to consumer online commerce  existing and new businesses in a wide variety of vertical markets are seeking to capitalize on this growth 
the company believes its software enables its customers to benefit from the growth of the internet by supporting new internet online storefronts and enabling re engineering of supply chains to facilitate e commerce transactions 
since inception  the company has significantly increased its investment in sales and marketing  service and support  research and development and general and administrative personnel and infrastructure 
as a result of these investments  together with the increasing awareness of the benefits of supply chain management in general and increased market acceptance of the company s products in particular  the company s revenues in  and were substantially higher than the levels achieved in prior years 
in order to capture additional market share  the company expects to continue to increase staffing levels and incur additional associated costs in future periods through both direct efforts and potential acquisitions 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s revenues will grow in future periods or that the company will maintain the substantial growth rates in revenues it realized in  and the sales cycle for the company s products is typically six to nine months  and license revenues for a particular period are substantially dependent on orders received and software functionality delivered in that period 
furthermore  the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant variation in the size of individual sales 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to be subject to significant fluctuations in the future 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
from time to time  the company has selectively acquired complementary businesses  products and technologies 
the company s consolidated financial statements periodically have been restated to reflect the pooling accounting treatment of certain of these transactions 
in may  the company acquired think systems corporation think and optimax systems corporation optimax for million and million shares of common stock  respectively 
each acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in april  the company acquired intertrans logistics solutions limited itls for million shares of common stock in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the company acquired certain other businesses in for an aggregate purchase price of million  which included cash  stock  assumed liabilities and acquisition costs in transactions accounted for using the purchase accounting method 
all share and per share amounts included in this form k have been adjusted to reflect a two for one split of the common stock effected as a dividend on june  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income year ended december  revenues software licenses services maintenance total revenues costs and expenses cost of software licenses cost of services and maintenance sales and marketing research and development general and administrative in process research and development and acquisition related expenses total costs and expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues the company s revenues consist of software license revenues  service revenues and maintenance revenues 
software license revenues consist of sales of software licenses which  for periods subsequent to december   are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
under sop  software license revenues are recognized upon execution of a contract and delivery of software  provided that the license fee is fixed and determinable  no significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and collection is considered probable by management 
for periods prior to december   software license revenues were recognized in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
under sop  software license revenues were recognized upon execution of a contract and shipment of the software  provided that no significant vendor obligations remained outstanding  amounts were due within one year and collection was considered probable by management 
the application of sop did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in  software license revenues will be recognized in accordance with sop  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
the company believes it is currently in compliance with sop  as modified by sop service revenues are primarily derived from fees for implementation  consulting and training services and are recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with initial license sales and subsequent renewals 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance 
total revenues increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the company currently derives substantially all of its revenues from licenses associated with its rhythm suite of software products as well as related services and maintenance 
the company expects that revenues from the expanded suite of rhythm products will continue to account for substantially all of the company s revenues in the foreseeable future 
as a result of the company s dependence on the continued market acceptance of the rhythm suite of products and enhancements thereto  there can be no assurance that total revenues will continue to increase at the rates experienced in prior periods  if at all 
software licenses 
revenues from software licenses increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in software license revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the significant increases in the dollar amount of software license revenues were primarily due to an increased customer awareness of the benefits derived from deploying the company s decision support solutions  a substantial investment in the company s infrastructure to support the growing demand for the company s products and continued strength in key targeted vertical markets 
to date  sales of software licenses have principally been derived from direct sales to customers 
although the company believes that direct sales will continue to account for the majority of software license revenues  the company s strategy is to continue to increase the level of indirect sales activities 
the company expects that sales of its software products through sales alliances  distributors  resellers and other indirect channels will continue to increase as a percentage of software license revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to expand indirect sales will be successful 
services 
revenues from services increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in service revenues constituted  and of total revenues in   and  respectively 
the significant increases in the dollar amount of service revenues were primarily due to the significant increase in the number of rhythm licenses sold and a significant investment in the company s consulting organization as a result of the increased demand for the company s products 
the increases were also due to an increase in the use of third party consultants to provide implementation services to the company s customers  which has allowed the company to more rapidly penetrate international markets 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a period to period basis based upon the demand for implementation  training and consulting services 
maintenance 
revenues from maintenance increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in maintenance revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the significant increases in the dollar amount of maintenance revenues were primarily due to the continued increase in the number of rhythm licenses sold and a high percentage of maintenance agreement renewals 
the company expects that maintenance revenues both in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues will continue to increase from the levels achieved in concentration of revenues 
during  one customer accounted for approximately of total revenues 
while on an annual basis  no individual customer accounted for more than of total revenues in or  the company generally derives a significant portion of its software license revenues in each quarter from a small number of relatively large sales 
for example  in the second  third and fourth quarters of and in each quarter of  one or more customers each accounted for at least of total software license revenues 
while the company believes that the loss of any of these particular customers would not have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results or financial condition  an inability to consummate one or more substantial license sales in any future period could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results for that period 
international revenues 
the company recognized million  million and million of revenues from international sources in  and  representing approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
the company s revenues from international sources were primarily generated from customers located in asia pacific  canada and europe 
in  and  revenues from customers located in europe accounted for approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
the decrease in revenues from international sources as a percentage of total revenues in was primarily due to the strength of sales efforts in the us  reorganization of the company s international management team which resulted in a lower than expected level of sales execution  and overall weakness in certain international economies  primarily in the asia pacific region  resulting in decreased levels of customer spending in those markets 
the company believes that continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its sales in international markets 
in order to successfully increase international sales  the company has utilized and will continue to utilize substantial resources to expand existing international operations  establish additional international operations and hire additional personnel 
costs and expenses cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists primarily of i commissions paid to third parties in connection with joint marketing and other related agreements  ii royalty fees associated with third party software included with the sales of rhythm  iii the cost of user documentation and iv the cost of reproduction and delivery of the software 
cost of software licenses was million  million and  in  and  representing  and of software license revenues  respectively 
the increases in cost of software licenses were primarily due to an increase in commissions paid to third parties in connection with joint marketing and other related agreements 
the company expects cost of software licenses to vary in the future depending upon the amount of commissions due to other third parties in connection with joint marketing and other related agreements and the amount of royalty fees associated with third party software included with the sales of rhythm 
cost of services and maintenance 
cost of services and maintenance consists primarily of personnel costs associated with implementation  consulting and training services 
cost of services and maintenance also includes the cost of providing software maintenance to customers such as hotline telephone support and packaging and shipping costs related to new releases of software and updated user documentation 
cost of services and maintenance was million  million  and million in  and  representing  and of total services and maintenance revenues  respectively 
the dollar increases in cost of services and maintenance were due to the increase in the number of consultants  product support and training staff and the increased use of third party consultants to provide implementation services 
in addition  consulting and support centers were established and expanded in europe  canada and asia pacific in the last few years 
the company expects to continue to increase the number of its consulting  product support and training personnel in the foreseeable future as a means to expand into different geographic and vertical markets 
consequently  the cost of services and maintenance as a percentage of total services and maintenance revenues may increase in the future 
to the extent that the company s license sales do not increase at anticipated rates  the hiring of additional personnel could adversely affect the company s gross margins 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  promotional events such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences  advertising and public relations programs 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increases in the dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses were due to continued expansion of the company s direct sales force  increased sales commissions as a result of the higher revenue levels  continued investment in strengthening the company s international selling presence  and increased marketing and promotional activities as a result of the company s expanded suite of products 
the company expects these types of expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
research and development 
research and development expenses include personnel and related overhead costs for product development  enhancements  upgrades  quality assurance and testing 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increases in the dollar amount of research and development expenses were primarily due to the hiring of additional research and development personnel and other related costs incurred to support the company s growing strategic product footprint 
the company expects that the dollar amount of research and development expenses will continue to increase as the company continues to invest in developing new products  applications and product enhancements for new and existing vertical markets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed fas  software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
to date  the establishment of technological feasibility of the company s products and general release of such software have substantially coincided 
as a result  software development costs qualifying for capitalization under fas have been insignificant  and therefore  the company has not capitalized any such costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the personnel and other costs of the finance  human resources  information systems  administrative and executive departments of the company and the fees and expenses associated with legal  accounting and other services 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increases in the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses were primarily the result of increased staffing and related costs associated with the growth of the company s business during these periods 
the decreases in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were primarily due to the increase in revenues and the company s ability to leverage its base of resources to support a larger organization 
the company expects that the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
in process research and development and acquisition related expenses 
from time to time  the company has sought to expand the depth of its current product offerings through various technology or business acquisitions 
some of these business combinations involve technology that is not yet determined to be technologically feasible and has no alternative future use in its current stage of development at the acquisition date 
in such instances  in accordance with appropriate accounting guidelines  the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development is expensed immediately upon acquisition 
further  the final purchase price on certain transactions is ultimately dependent upon future events such as payouts based on the attainment of future revenue targets for the acquired products or technologies 
such future earnouts  if any  may be considered additional cost of the acquired company and would be allocated based on the initial valuation of the acquired and in process technologies and resulting purchase price allocation 
in  the company incurred approximately million in certain acquisition related expenses in connection with business combinations  of which million represents the write off of in process research and development 
the remaining costs primarily consisted of investment banking  legal and accounting fees and expenses 
in  the company incurred a total of approximately million in certain acquisition related expenses in connection with business combinations  of which million represents the write off of in process research and development 
the remaining costs primarily consisted of investment banking  legal and accounting fees and expenses 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income on short term investments and overnight repurchase agreements offset by interest expense  if any 
other income  net was million  million and million in  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increases in the dollar amount of other income  net were primarily due to interest earned on higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from net proceeds of the public offerings of common stock in and provision for income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in the company s effective income tax rate is primarily due to the non deductibility of certain of the in process research and development and acquisition related expenses 
excluding the effects of the in process research and development and acquisition related expenses  the company s effective tax rate was  and  in  and  respectively 
net income per share the company s net income per share is calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share 
this method requires calculation of both net income per share and net income per share  assuming dilution 
net income per share excludes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents such as stock options  while net income per share  assuming dilution includes such dilutive effects 
future shares outstanding will be impacted by the following factors i the ongoing issuance of common stock associated with stock option exercises  ii the issuance of common stock associated with the company s employee stock purchase program  iii any fluctuations in the company s stock price  which could cause changes in the number of common stock equivalents included in the earnings per share  assuming dilution computation  and iv the issuance of common stock  or equivalents thereto  to effect future corporate transactions  including business combinations  should the company enter into such transactions 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and met its capital expenditure requirements primarily through cash flows from operations and sales of equity securities 
cash flows from operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
operating cash flows increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in net income  deferred revenues and the tax benefit from stock option activity  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the tax benefit from stock option activity is primarily the result of disqualifying dispositions of stock acquired under the company s stock plans 
operating cash flows decreased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by increases in the tax benefit from stock option activity  accrued liabilities and accrued compensation and related expenses 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to strong fourth quarter revenues in accounts receivable can fluctuate for a variety of reasons  including i the amount and timing of revenues earned  ii the company s collection experience  iii the amount of receivables generated from international customers which generally have longer payment terms compared to customers in the us  and iv the number of large sales for which some amounts may not be due upon execution of the contract 
the company believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  is adequate to cover any collection difficulties with respect to accounts receivable 
however  a significant portion of the company s accounts receivable are derived from sales of large licenses  often to new customers with whom the company does not have a payment history 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the allowance will be adequate to cover any receivables that are later determined to be uncollectible  particularly if one or more large receivables become uncollectible 
cash used in investing activities was million for as compared to million for cash used in investing activities was higher in than in primarily due to the investment of the net proceeds from the december public offering of common stock 
at the end of  the proceeds from that offering were invested primarily in financial instruments classified as cash equivalents 
cash provided by financing activities was million for as compared to million for cash provided by financing activities for includes the company s net proceeds of million from its december public offering of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities for includes the company s net proceeds of million from its may initial public offering of common stock 
at december   the company had million of working capital  including million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million of working capital as of december   including million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
at december   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  or enter into joint venture arrangements  that could complement or expand the company s business 
any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease to the company s working capital  depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
in october  the company entered into a one year  million revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement is not subject to a borrowing base limitation and borrowings under the agreement bear interest at various customary market rates 
the maximum borrowings available under the facility are reduced by the value of outstanding letters of credit issued by the lender on behalf of the company  million of which were outstanding at december  this facility contains customary restrictive covenants  including covenants requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investment balances  available borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and potential cash flow from operations will satisfy the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
the company is currently considering various alternatives for obtaining additional equity or debt financing 
any material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies could require the company to obtain such financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
year issues many older computer systems and software products currently in use are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
based on the company s assessment  the company believes that its current versions of its software products are year compliant 
however  the company believes some customers are running earlier versions of the software products developed by acquired companies that are not year compliant  and the company has been encouraging such customers to migrate to current product versions 
moreover  the company s products are generally integrated into enterprise systems involving complicated software products developed by other vendors 
year problems inherent in a customer s transactional software programs might significantly limit that customer s ability to realize the intended benefits offered by rhythm 
the company may in the future be subject to claims based on year problems in others products  custom scripts created by third parties to interface with the company s products or issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system 
although the company has not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding to date involving its products or services related to year compliance issues  there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services in such proceedings  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liability of the company for year related damages  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company believes that year issues may affect the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers in a variety of ways 
many companies are expending significant resources to correct  patch or replace their current software systems to achieve year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products such as those offered by the company 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s plan to resolve year issues includes assessment  remediation and testing of internal management and other information systems 
the completed assessment indicated that a portion of the company s information systems could be affected 
as of december   remediation and testing of such systems was complete with an expected completion date of september   however  system compliance testing will continue in conjunction with the company s overall information systems initiatives throughout areas being addressed include reviews of the company s telephone and voice mail systems  security systems and other office support systems 
no information technology initiatives have been deferred by the company as a result of its year project 
in  the company incurred approximately  of expenses related to correction of year issues 
the company currently expects to incur expenses of approximately  during in connection with the correction of year issues 
such expenses are being funded through operating cash flows  and are expected to be less than of the company s information technology budget for management of the company believes that an effective plan is in place to resolve the year issues in a timely manner 
although the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of its year program  the company does not believe that material exposure to significant business interruption exists as a result of year compliance issues or that the cost of remedial actions will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of its year plan 
the company intends to evaluate the status of completion throughout to determine whether such a plan is necessary

all of the cash equivalents and short term investments are treated as available for sale under sfas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the company s investment securities are held for purposes other than trading
