two business segments compose the majority of the company s results from operations the packaging business  operated through graphic packaging corporation graphic packaging  and the ceramics business  operated through coors ceramics company coors ceramics 
graphic packaging is a nonintegrated manufacturer of both folding carton and flexible packages and participates in the beverage  frozen food  dried good  soap and detergent  bakery  tobacco  pet food  confectionery  quick service restaurant  coffee  photographic  and personal care markets 
in january  the company acquired britton group plc britton 
britton operated through two principal divisions folding cartons and plastics 
the folding cartons division  universal packaging corporation universal packaging  is a nonintegrated manufacturer of folding cartons in the united states  with capabilities in design  printing  and manufacturing of multicolor folding cartons 
the company sold the plastics division of britton in april in march  graphic packaging acquired gravure packaging  inc  gravure located in richmond  virginia 
coors ceramics develops  manufactures  and sells advanced technical ceramic products and other engineered materials across a wide range of product lines for a variety of custom applications 
coors ceramics  which has been in business for more than years  is the largest us owned  independent manufacturer of advanced technical ceramics 
the majority of coors ceramics sales were to the automotive  petrochemical  power generation and mining  semiconductor equipment  telecommunications  and pulp and paper industries 
in addition to the primary operating businesses  the company owns other businesses other  primarily operating through its majority owned subsidiary  golden genesis company golden genesis 
golden genesis focus is on assembling and distributing solar electric systems 
the other businesses also include a real estate development partnership 
additionally  the historical results for the other businesses include the operations of a biodegradable polymer project and a corn wet milling facility that produced high fructose corn syrup and refined corn starch 
during  the company exited the biodegradable polymer project 
in  the company exited the high fructose corn syrup business 
on january   the company sold the remaining corn wet mill operations 
the company is working toward exit strategies for all noncore businesses 
this financial review presents the company s operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and its financial condition at december  and this review should be read in connection with the information presented in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto 
discontinued operations in  the board of directors adopted a plan to dispose of the company s aluminum rigid container sheet business operated by golden aluminum company golden aluminum 
in conjunction with this decision  the company recorded pretax charges of million for anticipated losses upon the disposition and estimated operating losses of the business through the disposition date 
in march of  the sale of golden aluminum was completed for million  including a nonrefundable million which was paid at closing and million due within two years 
subsequently  the due date was extended to september  in accordance with the purchase agreement and subsequent extension  the purchaser has the right to return golden aluminum to the company prior to september  in discharge of the million obligation 
in this event  the company will pursue alternative means to dispose of this business 
the historical operating results and the estimated loss on the sale of golden aluminum have been segregated as discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated income statement for all periods presented 
substantially all the assets of golden aluminum were sold as of december  discontinued operations have not been segregated on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
accordingly  the consolidated statement of cash flows includes sources and uses of cash for golden aluminum 
from the acquisition date of britton  the company accounted for the plastics division as a discontinued operation 
therefore  due to purchase accounting  neither the operation of the plastics division nor its disposition had an impact on the company s results of operations 
results from continuing operations consolidated net sales net sales for totaled million  an increase of million  or  over net sales of million 
the january  acquisition of universal packaging accounted for the increase in net sales 
partially offsetting this increase  net sales at coors ceramics were down compared with  primarily due to weaker sales to semiconductor  pulp and paper  and electronics customers 
net sales for increased million  or  over net sales of million 
sales growth in was driven by increases at both coors ceramics and graphic packaging  partially offset by sales declines in the other businesses 
net sales to coors brewing company coors brewing consisted of packaging products and refined corn starch and accounted for   and of   and total revenues  respectively 
on january   the company sold its corn wet milling operation and ceased to sell refined corn starch 
the company continues to pursue new markets and customers in an effort to be less dependent upon coors brewing 
the company had sales to customers outside the united states  primarily in canada and western europe  of million  or of total net sales 
this compares to foreign sales of million  or of total sales  in in  foreign sales accounted for million  or of total net sales 
the decrease in foreign sales in is attributable to the strength of the us dollar and currency related price competition 
future years sales growth is expected to be slightly better than the us economy growth rate at coors ceramics and slightly better than the packaging industry rates for graphic packaging 
this growth will be enhanced by the pursuit of niche acquisitions  additional base business revenues  and the strength of relationships with existing customers for their future needs 
the company intends to work toward exiting its other noncore businesses 
gross margin consolidated gross margin was   and for   and  respectively 
the lower consolidated gross margin reflects lower gross margins at both graphic packaging and coors ceramics 
graphic packaging s lower margins in resulted from the acquisition of universal packaging  which has lower comparative margins 
graphic packaging s base business margins were also lower in compared with due to competitive pricing pressures in the industry and underutilization of some of its flexible packaging assets 
coors ceramics margins declined as a result of price competition  particularly in international markets due to the strength of the us dollar vis a vis certain foreign currencies 
in  graphic packaging enjoyed higher gross margins as compared to due to increased sales volumes  productivity gains  operating efficiencies  and the gravure acquisition 
partially offsetting these gains in  coors ceramics experienced slight declines in margins  primarily due to lower margins on certain sales resulting from currency influenced price competition 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for   and were million  million  and million  which represented   and of net sales  respectively 
the decreased selling  general and administrative expenses in reflect the addition of universal packaging  which operates with lower overhead expenses  and a reduction of research and development expenses related to the company s decision to exit its developmental businesses 
the increase in is attributable to the inclusion of a full year of expenses for the solar electric businesses acquired in november operating income from continuing operations by segment in millions before asset impairment and restructuring charges graphic packaging coors ceramics other businesses corporate operating income before asset impairment and restructuring charges asset impairment and restructuring charges graphic packaging coors ceramics other businesses operating income after asset impairment and restructuring charges consolidated operating income for  excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges  grew to million  an increase of over operating income before asset impairment and restructuring charges 
the addition of universal packaging accounted for this increase  partially offset by an operating income decline at coors ceramics 
consolidated operating income for  excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges  grew to million  an increase of million  or  over operating income before asset impairment and restructuring charges 
record operating income in at both coors ceramics and graphic packaging contributed to this increase 
asset impairment charges the company recorded a total of million  million  and million in asset impairment charges in   and  respectively 
in  goodwill write downs totaled million  with the remainder of the charge consisting of fixed asset impairments 
there were no goodwill write downs in or graphic packaging graphic packaging recorded million in asset impairment charges in deterioration of its performance at certain facilities and increased competitive conditions led management to review the carrying amounts of long lived assets and goodwill in conjunction with an overall restructuring plan 
see restructuring charges below 
specifically  forecasted operating cash flows did not support the carrying amount of certain long lived assets and goodwill at graphic packaging s franklin  ohio operation 
in addition  management decided to offer for sale the vancouver  british columbia operation and close a divisional office in north carolina 
therefore  the long lived assets and related goodwill were written down to their estimated market values 
coors ceramics during  coors ceramics recorded million in asset impairment charges 
a million charge was taken in conjunction with the cancellation of coors ceramics c technology agreement with ibm 
changes in the market for c applications extended the time frame for achieving commercial sales beyond original expectations 
the lack of near term commercial sales opportunities  combined with increasing overhead costs  prompted the company to negotiate termination of the agreement with ibm 
consequently  the company wrote off the long lived assets associated with this project 
the company recorded an additional million asset impairment charge at the chattanooga  tennessee operation 
management decided to offer this operation for sale as strong offshore competition in the electronic package market made it uneconomical to have a manufacturing facility dedicated to this product line 
consequently  the long lived assets of the chattanooga operations were written down to their estimated market values 
other the company recorded net asset impairment charges of million in its other businesses 
these charges include a million asset impairment charge to write down long lived assets of solartec  sa  a solar electric subsidiary in argentina 
since acquiring solartec in november  operating cash flows have been below original expectations 
as a result  the company recorded this impairment to reduce the carrying value of its investment in solartec to its estimated fair market value 
in addition  the company recorded a million asset impairment charge related to the consolidation and outsourcing of certain manufacturing activities at golden genesis 
as a result  certain long lived assets became impaired and were written down to their estimated market value 
also during  the company sold certain equipment formerly used in the biodegradable polymer project for approximately million 
these assets had been previously written off as an asset impairment  so the resulting gain on sale of these assets was netted against the asset impairment charge 
during  the company recorded a million asset impairment charge when it adopted a plan to limit future funding for the biodegradable polymer project 
this decision reduced expected future cash flows for this activity to a level below the carrying value of the manufacturing and intangible assets of this project 
in  the company recorded million in asset impairment charges related to the corn wet milling business and the solar panel manufacturing activity 
the assets of the corn wet milling business became impaired when unfavorable market conditions decreased ongoing customer purchase commitments and anticipated future net cash flows 
the solar panel manufacturing activity assets became impaired due to a lack of a currently viable market for cadmium telluride solar panels  the lack of an alternative use for panel manufacturing assets  and the company s move from manufacturing to solar electric distribution 
restructuring charges the company recorded restructuring charges totaling million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the following table summarizes accruals related to these restructuring charges corn biodegradable syrup graphic graphic polymer exit exit packaging packaging in millions plan plan corporate operations other total restructuring charges cash paid non cash expenses balance  december  restructuring charges cash paid non cash expenses balance  december  restructuring charges cash paid balance  december  graphic packaging during  the company instituted a restructuring plan related to certain graphic packaging operations and recorded million in restructuring charges 
this plan included the consolidation and realignment of certain administrative functions and the downsizing of its franklin  ohio operation 
this plan resulted in the elimination of approximately administrative and manufacturing positions with related severance costs of approximately million 
this plan also included approximately million in other exit costs related to the closure of a divisional office in north carolina 
the company made cash payments of million in the fourth quarter of and expects to make the remaining cash outlays and complete this restructuring plan in the first half of in december  the company recorded a million charge related to the closure of the graphic packaging corporate offices in wayne  pennsylvania 
this closure resulted in severance and outplacement costs of million for approximately administrative employees

the company made cash outlays of approximately million and million related to this plan in and  respectively 
the company adopted a plan to exit the high fructose corn syrup business in as a result  the company eliminated approximately manufacturing and administrative positions and recorded million in severance and other exit costs 
the company made approximately million and million in cash outlays related to this plan in and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the liability remaining for this exit plan was not required 
accordingly  the remaining liability was reversed and netted against the restructuring charges 
in  the company recorded million in restructuring charges related to certain management realignments made in the solar electric distribution business resulting in the elimination of administrative positions 
approximately million and million were paid for severance and other exit costs related to this charge in and  respectively 
interest expense and interest income interest expense for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in reflects additional borrowings used to finance the britton acquisition  along with interest on debt assumed in the acquisition 
the million increase in resulted primarily from lower capitalized interest amounts associated with fewer large capital projects in interest income for   and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease from to reflects the lower cash balances resulting from the company s acquisition of britton in the increase in interest income between and reflects imputed interest on the company s note receivable related to the sale of golden aluminum 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate for the company in was compared to in and in the higher tax rate in compared with and resulted from a lower earnings base  which increased the impact of non deductible items 
in addition  no tax benefit was taken for built in losses on a subsidiary experiencing tax losses and for capital losses that may not be deductible due to a lack of offsetting capital gains 
the company expects to maintain its effective tax rate for future years at the historical rate of approximately 
graphic packaging graphic packaging s net sales for were million  an increase of million  or  over net sales of million 
the increase is attributable to the january acquisition of universal packaging and better than industry sales growth in its proprietary specialty packaging products 
these gains were offset by significant pricing pressures for flexible packaging and volume declines to the tobacco market 
graphic packaging s net sales increased million  or  over net sales of million 
the increase in net sales for was a result of additional volume in several markets including confectionery  bakery  snack food  and detergent 
in   and  folding carton sales accounted for   and of total net sales  respectively  with flexible sales accounting for the balance of the business 
sales to coors brewing were approximately   and of graphic packaging s net sales for   and  respectively 
graphic packaging expects to continue increasing sales to unaffiliated customers  thereby decreasing its dependence on coors brewing 
graphic packaging s operating income for was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to operating income of million 
operating income for includes million in asset impairment and restructuring charges discussed above 
excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charges in both periods  operating income increased million  or  over operating income 
the addition of universal packaging  strong sales of specialty packaging  and reduced corporate costs account for this increase 
these gains were partially offset by a significant decline in margins for flexible packaging products 
graphic packaging s operating income for represented an increase of million  or  over operating income 
the increase in operating income is primarily attributable to additional volume to the confectionery  bakery  snack food  and detergent markets  as well as productivity improvements  partially offset by million in restructuring charges 
operating margins were   and for   and  respectively 
the lower operating margin in reflects the asset impairment and restructuring charges discussed above and the relatively lower margins at universal packaging  partially offset by savings realized in the relocation of graphic packaging s corporate offices to colorado in december operating margin declines in related to restructuring charges  offset in part by the increased volumes discussed above 
graphic packaging continues to focus on commercializing new products and processes to serve existing and new markets and to pursue acquisitions that complement its existing business

the lower net sales in reflect downturns in sales to the semiconductor  pulp and paper  telecommunications  and petrochemical industries 
coors ceramics net sales for increased million over net sales of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to a rebound in the telecommunications  semiconductor and data processing industries and increased sales volumes to the petrochemical industry in over international sales as a percentage of total net sales were   and in   and  respectively 
the relatively lower international sales in and were primarily attributable to lower sales dollars from some international customers due to currency influenced price competition resulting from the strong us dollar vis a vis certain foreign currencies 
operating income for totaled million  a decline of million  or  from operating income of million 
excluding the asset impairment charges  operating income totaled million  a decline of million  or  from other than the asset impairment charges  the lower operating income in reflects a downturn in sales to customers in key market segments and the effects of currency influenced price competition resulting from a strong us dollar 
operating income for rose million  or  over operating income of million 
the increase between and operating income is attributable to increases in sales volumes described above partially offset by margin erosion due to currency influenced price competition 
operating margins declined in to from in the lower operating margins in reflect million in asset impairment charges discussed above  lower sales volumes in higher margin semiconductor and pulp and paper industry product lines  and currency influenced price competition 
operating margins decreased slightly in to compared to in  primarily due to currency influenced price competition 
in  coors ceramics will continue its efforts to grow through new product development  expanded market share in its current product lines  vertical integration in key industries such as semiconductor  and the addition of new materials and processes to its product mix 
the outlook is dependent upon the continued strength of key segments of the us and european economies  effective capacity utilization  and coors ceramics ability to compete abroad 
other net sales for the other businesses in totaled million  an increase of million  or  over net sales of million 
the increase reflects higher sales volumes due to acquisitions of solar electric distributors by golden genesis 
net sales in reflected a decrease of million  or  compared to net sales of million 
the company s decision to exit the high fructose corn syrup business  partially offset by a full year of sales for golden genesis  acquired in november  caused this decrease 
the other businesses reported an operating loss of million in this compares favorably to the operating loss of million in the operating loss includes million in asset impairment and restructuring charges discussed above 
excluding the effects of asset impairment and restructuring charges  the additional improvement of million between and reflects the company s decision to exit certain noncore businesses 
the operating loss of million compares with a operating loss of million  which includes million in asset impairment and restructuring costs 
excluding the impact of the asset impairment and restructuring charges  the other businesses operating loss decreased  or million  between and the operating results include a full year of results from golden genesis and reflect the elimination of losses associated with the corn syrup business  partially offset by higher research and development expenses at the biodegradable polymer project early in financial resources and liquidity acx technologies liquidity is generated from both internal and external sources and is used to fund short term working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and share repurchases 
internally generated liquidity is measured by net cash from operations  as discussed below  and working capital

as of december   the company had repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
in march of  the company completed the sale of golden aluminum 
this sale generated million in cash at closing and is expected to generate an additional million in cash in if the buyer does not return golden aluminum to the company as permitted by the purchase agreement 
the working capital of golden aluminum  which was not part of the sale agreement  was liquidated in as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows  net cash provided by operations was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
cash generated in reflects the liquidation of the working capital of golden aluminum 
the lower level of cash generated in relative to other years was primarily attributable to losses in discontinued operations 
during   and  net cash from operations was used to fund capital requirements and acquisitions 
over this three year period  total capital expenditures for the company  excluding corporate  were million  as follows in millions graphic packaging coors ceramics other businesses golden aluminum discontinued in consolidated capital spending during was primarily for facility expansions and reconfigurations as well as technological upgrades to machinery and equipment and related computer systems 
the company expects its capital expenditures for to be between million and million  primarily at graphic packaging 
graphic packaging s capital budget includes completion of its new manufacturing facility in golden  colorado  along with equipment for additional capacity at existing plants and performance improvements to existing equipment 
coors ceramics capital budget is expected to be substantially less than in previous years and is planned to be focused on performance improvements to existing equipment 
the other businesses do not anticipate having significant capital expenditures in acquisitions during utilized million in cash  primarily for the acquisition of britton 
the company plans to continue to pursue value added acquisitions that provide growth and synergies with its core businesses 
the company currently expects that cash flows from operations  the sale of certain assets  borrowings under its current credit facilities  and anticipated new borrowings will be adequate to meet the company s needs for working capital  temporary financing for capital expenditures  share repurchases  debt repayments  and acquisitions 
the impact of inflation on the company s financial position and results of operations has been minimal and is not expected to adversely affect future results 
environmental some of the company s subsidiaries have been notified that they may be potentially responsible parties prps under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of or similar state laws with respect to the remediation of certain sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment 
the company cannot predict with certainty the total costs of remediation  its share of the total costs  the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties  the amount of time necessary to complete the remediation  or the availability of insurance 
however  based on investigations to date  the company believes that any liability with respect to these sites would not be material to the financial condition and results of operations of the company  without consideration for insurance recoveries 
there can be no certainty  however  that the company will not be named as a prp at additional sites or be subject to other environmental matters in the future or that the costs associated with those additional sites or matters would not be material 
in addition  the company has received demands arising out of alleged contamination of various properties currently or formerly owned by the company 
in management s opinion  none of these claims will result in liability that would materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
year readiness disclosure the year issue arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results disrupting normal business operations 
management has implemented an enterprise wide program to prepare the company s financial  manufacturing  and other critical systems and applications for the year the program includes a task force established in march that has the support and participation of upper management and includes individuals with expertise in risk management  legal  and information technologies 
the board of directors monitors the progress of the program on a quarterly basis 
the task force s objective is to ensure an uninterrupted transition to the year by assessing  testing  and modifying all information technology it and non it systems  interdependent systems  and third parties such as suppliers and customers 
the year task force has taken an inventory of all it and non it systems 
this inventory categorizes potential systems date failures into three categories major critical to production and could be business threatening with no short term alternatives available  limited disrupting to the business operations with short term solutions available  and minor inconsequential to the business operations 
the task force has prioritized the program to focus first on major systems 
it is the company s goal to have all systems year compliant no later than september  it systems the company is primarily using internal resources to remediate it systems 
external resources are used to assist in testing compliance of it systems 
the company does not rely on any one it system 
the majority of the it systems have been recently purchased from third party vendors 
these systems were already year compliant or had year compliance upgrades 
as of december   approximately of the company s it systems were year compliant 
non it systems the company has approximately manufacturing facilities with varying degrees of non it systems such as printing presses  automated kiln systems  statistical process control systems  ink mixing systems  quality control systems  and machining equipment 
the vast majority of these facilities are located in north america 
to ensure year compliance for non it systems  the year task force has contacted the suppliers of these non it systems and obtained statements that the systems are year compliant and is in the process of testing year compliance 
the majority of these non it systems use time intervals instead of dates and are year compliant 
thus  the company believes that potential disruptions of such systems due to the year issue should be minimal 
as of december   approximately of the company s major and limited non it systems are year compliant 
the minor non it systems are in various stages of compliance 
third parties the year task force has been in contact with key suppliers and customers to minimize potential business disruptions related to the year issue between the company and these third parties 
the task force has focused on suppliers and customers that are classified as major and limited 
while the company cannot guarantee compliance by third party suppliers  the company has developed contingency plans to ensure the availability of inventory supplies in the event a supplier is not year compliant 
contingency plans the company is in the process of finalizing contingency plans in the event there are year failures related to the company s it and non it systems and or key third parties 
the company s manufacturing facilities are not interdependent in terms of non it systems  and its facilities utilize a diverse range of non it systems ie  printing presses  kilns  and other manufacturing equipment 
in addition  no one facility accounts for a significant amount of revenue 
thus  the contingency plan includes for non it systems the transfer of production between facilities and manufacturing equipment 
currently  the company believes that there is enough manufacturing capacity to accommodate the contingency plan 
the company s it systems are also not heavily interdependent between facilities and key third parties and the company utilizes a diverse range of it systems 
the contingency plan for it systems includes the ability to transfer transaction processing  record keeping  and compliance work between facilities and maintaining hard copies of critical information 
the company is not dependent on any one supplier 
the company has established back up suppliers and will maintain adequate inventory levels at december  to minimize the potential business disruption in the event of a year failure by a supplier 
costs through december   the company has spent approximately million out of an estimated total million related to the year issue 
these costs include the costs incurred for external consultants and professional advisors and the costs for software and hardware 
the company has not separately tracked internal costs such as payroll related costs for its information technologies group and other employees working on the year project 
the company expenses all costs related to the year issue as incurred 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
the company s current estimate of the time and costs related to the remediation of the year issue are based on the facts and circumstances existing at this time 
new developments could affect the company s estimates to remediate the year issue 
these developments include  but are not limited to i the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  ii the ability to identify and remediate all it and non it systems  iii unanticipated failures in it and non it systems  and iv the planning and year compliance success that key customers and suppliers attain 
factors that may affect future results certain statements in this document constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance  or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
specifically  the company s ability to lessen its dependence on coors brewing is dependent on identifying and capturing new customers  successfully increasing sales to existing unaffiliated customers  and the success of the company s marketing plans  future years revenue growth is dependent on numerous factors  including the continued strength of the us and key foreign economies  the relative position of the us dollar vis a vis key european and asian currencies  the actions of competitors and customers  the company s ability to execute its marketing plans  and the ability of the company to maintain or increase sales to existing customers and capture new business  the company s ability to grow through acquisitions depends on its ability to identify attractive and synergistic acquisition opportunities  to successfully finance such acquisitions  and to integrate acquired companies  the company s ability to exit noncore businesses depends on identifying and executing exit strategies for these businesses and other factors  the company s ability to maintain its effective tax rate at depends on the current and future tax laws  the company s ability to identify and use its tax credits  and other factors  the ability of graphic packaging to sustain profitable growth is dependent on numerous factors  including its ability to successfully market its products to new and existing customers  the ability to develop and bring to market new products  the ability to complete its new facility on time and on budget and qualify its products with customers  the ability to successfully complete focused acquisitions see number above  and the success of its customers  the company s overall financial results and financial condition is dependent upon its customers and suppliers ability to execute their year readiness plans  and coors ceramics ability to increase revenues and operating income is dependent upon its ability to continue its track record for new product innovation  general economic conditions such as the position of the us dollar vis a vis other currencies  the availability and pricing of substitute materials such as metals and plastics  the performance of key industry segments such as semiconductor  automotive  and electronics  and other factors
