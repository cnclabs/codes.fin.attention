the company s operating results in fiscal have improved from fiscal this was mainly due to increased hardware sales in asia  europe and north america as well as a strong effort on behalf of the company to reduce operating expenses 
the company s touring business continues to struggle 
the company derived million  million and million of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  from sponsorship of its fleet of touring motion simulators 
the company currently has only limited sponsorship contracts and has been unsuccessful in securing sponsorship arrangements that approach the levels enjoyed prior to fiscal in fiscal  the company sold one touring unit and continues to explore other strategic alternatives for the touring operations 
results were also impacted by certain one time charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company took approximately million in charges  including a loss on impairment of assets  legal and dispute reserves  additional film amortization expense and an increase in bad debt reserve 
in fiscal  results were adversely impacted by nonrecurring expenses related to a proposed merger between iwerks and showscan which did not receive the required shareholder vote in march in the fourth quarter of fiscal  results were adversely impacted by approximately million due to the termination of one contract for a one time research and development specialty project 
revenues for the fiscal year ended june   and are analyzed in the following table in thousands the company derives its revenues primarily from four sources sales of hardware systems  licensing of films  owned and operated primarily portable simulation theatres  and the production of films for third parties and rental of facilities  camera equipment 
revenues for the fiscal year ended june   and are analyzed in the following table in thousands fiscal year ended june hardware sales service    film licensing    owned and operated    film production and other  revenues on sales of theatre systems are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the ratio of percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each fixed price contract  over the life of the contract 
accordingly  the timing of shipment schedules as dictated by the customer can result in variability of quarterly revenues and earnings 
likewise  the cash received and used for the contract can vary from quarter to quarter with the revenue and cost recognition on the contract 
the gross margin for each contract varies based upon pricing strategies  competitive conditions and product mix 
film licensing revenues and related expenses are recognized at the beginning of the license period at which time the customer is billed the license fee and the film is delivered to the customer 
revenues from owned and operated o o consist of portable ride simulation theatre touring revenues derived primarily from corporate sponsorship or ticket sales at state fairs  air shows  and similar events as well as revenues derived from fixed site joint venture revenues which includes iwerks contractual share of the sites revenues or profits as applicable 
admission revenues from the portable ride simulation theatres are subject to variability due to the seasonal nature of these events and are higher during the summer months 
revenues for the portable theatres are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
in addition  revenues from o o for fiscal were benefitted by significant corporate sponsorships 
sponsorship revenues recognized in fiscal and were significantly lower than the fiscal level 
revenue from film production and other is generated primarily through the production of films for third parties  leasing of camera equipment and the rental of post production facilities 
the company recognizes revenues and costs associated with the production of custom films on the percentage of completion method 
the company typically realizes a smaller margin from the sale of custom films in comparison to its theatre system sales 
a significant portion of the company s sales are made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily in asia  south america  europe and canada 
revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and attributable to sales to these areas are summarized in the following table in thousands percentage of percentage of percentage of amount total revenue amount total revenue amount total revenue asia    south america   including mexico europe    canada  total export revenues    a sales representative maintains offices in hong kong and shanghai to support sales to asia 
the company also maintains an office in london  england to support its european sales 
south american sales are supported out of the sarasota  florida office 
international operations and sales may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency fluctuations  changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been proposed in the united states and in certain other countries 
any resulting change in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect iwerks international operations 
political and economic factors have been identified by the company with respect to certain markets in which it competes 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not result in customers of the company defaulting on payments owed to iwerks  or in the reduction of potential purchases of the company s products 
for example  turmoil in the economies of the countries in asia have had a material adverse affect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
revenues attributable to sales in asia declined from million for fiscal representing of the company s revenues to million in fiscal representing of the company s revenues 
during the fiscal year however  the company experienced an increase in sales to asia which increased to million in fiscal representing of the company s revenue 
the company is not able to predict to what extent  or for what period  economic trends may adversely affect the sales of its products 
typically  sales outside the united states are denominated in united states dollars and are backed by bank letters of credit  which reduce the risks related to international sales 
comparison of year ended june  to year ended june  revenues revenue for the fiscal year ended june  increased million or from the fiscal year revenue due to the factors described below 
hardware sales and service increased by million or from the prior fiscal year 
hardware sales in the asia region increased by million  north american hardware sales increased by million and hardware sales in europe increased by million 
the only decline in hardware sales was in the south america region where sales declined by approximately million 
film licensing revenues increased by approximately million or compared to the same period last year 
these results are due to new film venues in fiscal from new hardware sales  as well as new theme park attractions  several of which have signed multiple year license agreements 
many of these new venues are a direct result of new films which the company released this year 
owned and operated revenue decreased by approximately million as compared to the same period last year  primarily due to declining sales of approximately million in the touring division  partially offset by an increase in revenue from the fixed site joint ventures of approximately  the decline in sales  and related expenses  in the touring division is due to the company s decision to participate in fewer events than the prior year  focusing on the more profitable events 
the increase in joint venture revenue is the result of three additional joint venture sites opened during the second quarter of fiscal year the company expects the lower touring revenue trend to continue 
the company continues to seek additional sponsors as well as other alternatives for the touring business 
film production and other revenue increased by approximately million 
this was primarily due to the company securing one major film production deal in fiscal compared to none in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales primarily includes costs of theatre systems sold  expenses associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres  and costs associated with film production and distribution 
the cost of theatre systems include the cost of components  customization  engineering  project management  assembly  system integration  installation and estimated warranty expenses 
also included in cost of sales are royalties payable to a former joint venture partner 
the costs associated with film distribution primarily reflect amortization of film production costs over the lives of certain films and royalties paid to third parties 
the cost of sales associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres include costs for personnel  depreciation and amortization of million  event fees  fuel  insurance and maintenance 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for both fiscal years ended june  and included in the cost of sales in is a charge of approximately million due to the termination of one contract relating to a one time research and development specialty project 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include  among other things  personnel costs  trade shows and other promotional expenses  sales commissions  travel expenses  public relation costs  outside consulting and professional fees  depreciation on fixed assets  amortization of goodwill  departmental administrative costs and research and development costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million and approximately million  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction of million in employee related expenses from the prior year 
of those expenses  approximately million was related to severance costs that were made to fifteen employees including the former ceo and two other officers whose employment terminated in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  bad debt expense was approximately million larger in the prior year than fiscal due to the economic problems affecting the asian region in the prior year 
other savings included a reduction in building leases and business insurance partially offset by an increase in sales commissions and an increase in sales and marketing expenses due to the company s new corporate brand initiative launched in the fiscal year as well as a more comprehensive marketing program to support clients efforts to build their iwerks attractions 
merger related expenses the company incurred approximately million of non recurring expenses related to the proposed merger with showscan which did not receive the required shareholder vote in march these costs were primarily professional legal  accounting and investment banking fees of which approximately million was expensed in fiscal approximately million was expensed in fiscal interest income expense interest income for fiscal and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from a reduction in the invested cash balances during the fiscal year 
interest expense for fiscal and was  and  respectively 
this decrease resulted primarily from the scheduled maturity of capital lease obligations in fiscal income taxes the provisions for income taxes were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
as the company has significant net losses  the income tax provisions are primarily for foreign taxes and minimum state taxes 
net loss the company recorded net loss of  in  compared to a net loss of  in due aforementioned reasons 
comparison of year ended june  to year ended june  revenues revenue for the fiscal year ended june  decreased million or from the fiscal year revenue due to the factors described below 
hardware sales and service decreased by million or from the prior fiscal year 
most severely impacted were hardware sales in the asia pacific region  which decreased million due to the continued economic downturn in that part of the world 
north american and south american hardware sales declined in by million primarily as a result of timing of projects 
however  north american hardware bookings were higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal film licensing revenue increased from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to a net increase in the number of theatres which license films partially offset by pricing declines 
owned and operated revenue decreased million or  primarily from the company s touring ride simulators reactors  due primarily to the loss of a major sponsor at t corporation during fiscal year in addition  there was one less reactor in as it was sold in june of the loss of at t corporation accounted for million in lower revenues  however the general admission portion of this business increased by  the company continues to actively seek other sponsors as well as other alternatives to increase the utilization of the reactors 
film production and other revenue increased by approximately  primarily due to an increase in post production revenues 
there were no revenues derived from film production in fiscal or in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales primarily includes costs of theatre systems sold  expenses associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres  and costs associated with film production and licensing fees 
the cost of theatre systems include the cost of components  customization  engineering  project management  assembly  system integration  installation and estimated warranty expenses 
also included in cost of sales are royalties payable to a former joint venture partner 
the costs associated with film license fees primarily reflect amortization of film production costs over the lives of certain films and royalties paid to third parties 
the cost of sales associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres include costs for personnel  depreciation and amortization  event fees  fuel  insurance and maintenance 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was and for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of sales  in compared with  as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the absorption of certain fixed overhead charges which did not decrease as revenues decreased 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel costs  trade shows and other promotional expenses  sales commissions  travel expenses  public relations costs  amortization of goodwill  professional fees  research and development costs and divisional administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million and approximately million  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses between fiscal and was due primarily to a million charge for severance payments made to employees  including the former chief executive officer and other officers  partially offset by a percent decrease in employee related expenses 
this decrease in employee related expenses was due primarily to lower overall staffing levels than that of the prior year as a result of work force reductions made in fiscal merger related expenses the company incurred a total of approximately million of non recurring expenses related to the proposed merger with showscan which did not receive the required shareholder vote in march these costs were primarily professional legal  accounting and investment banking fees of which approximately million was expensed in fiscal and approximately  expensed in fiscal interest income expense interest income for fiscal and was approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from a reduction in the invested cash balances during the fiscal year 
interest expense for fiscal and was approximately  and approximately  respectively 
this decrease resulted primarily from the scheduled maturity of capital lease obligations in fiscal income taxes the provisions for income taxes were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
as the company has significant net losses  the income tax provisions are primarily for foreign taxes and minimum state taxes 
net loss the company recorded net loss of  in  compared to a net loss of  in due aforementioned reasons 
seasonality and fluctuating quarterly results the following tables set forth unaudited data regarding operations for each quarter of fiscal and and the percentage of the company s revenue and expenses represented by each item of the respective quarter 
this quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and  in management s opinion  contains all adjustments necessary to fairly state the information set forth herein 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal fiscal first second third fourth first second third fourth dollars in thousands quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter revenue         cost of sales         gross margin      selling  general and administrative         merger related expenses interest income expense  net income loss before provision for taxes     provision for taxes net loss     the company s operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of theatre system shipments  the mix of theatre system contracts  the completion of custom film contracts and the amount of revenues from portable simulation theatre and film licensing agreements 
hardware sales will likely continue to experience inexplicable quarterly fluctuations as they are substantially dependent on the customers varying delivery and installation requirements 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are primarily based upon revenue forecasts 
the sales cycle for the sale of a single attraction by the company typically ranges between six and eighteen months 
the company has little control over the timing of customer purchases 
in fiscal  the fourth quarter net income was impacted by approximately million relating to the loss of one contract for a one time research and development specialty project 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to severance costs associated with a company wide layoff and termination of certain others  including the chief executive officer  as well as recruitment costs for new management and directors 
also as a result of this downsizing  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses were lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing into fiscal the seasonal fluctuations in earnings also may cause volatility in the stock prices of the company 
while a significant portion of the company s expense levels are relatively fixed  the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on the company s forecasts of future sales 
if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
the company may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  approximately million in cash was provided by operating activities and million provided by financing activities  offset by million used in investing activities 
investing activities  primarily consisted of the purchase of property and equipment million  additions to film inventory million and investments in joint ventures million offset by the sale of debt securities million 
financing activities consisted primarily of the issuance of a note payable in conjunction with the terminated research and development specialty project contract offset by payments on capital leases million and a stock repurchase million program in which the company repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
in fiscal  approximately million in cash was used in operating activities and million was used in financing activities  offset by million provided by investing activities 
investing activities primarily consisted of additions to film inventory million and the purchase of property and equipment million  offset by the sale of debt securities million 
financing activities consisted primarily of payments on capital leases million 
at june  the company had cash and short term investments of approximately million compared to million at june  and million at june  the company s cash and short term investment balances have continued to decline since june  and the company expects to experience further declining balances during the remainder of fiscal management believes that its existing cash balances and short term investments  combined with anticipated cash flow from operations  will continue to decline  however they will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through the end of fiscal however  if the company is unable to achieve its projected cash flow from operations  the company may experience significantly reduced cash and short term investments  which could result in the company not being able to meet its operating needs 
the company is actively exploring possible equity or debt financing 
recent operating losses  the company s declining cash balances  the company s historical stock performance  and a general decrease in investor interest in the company s industry  may make it difficult for the company to attract equity investments on terms that are deemed to be favorable to the company 
in addition  the losses in fiscal and fiscal make it more difficult for the company to attract significant debt financing 
in the event that cash flow from operations is less than that anticipated and the company is unable to secure additional financing  in order to preserve cash  the company would be required to reduce expenditures for capital projects including new films and research and development  or effect further reductions in its corporate infrastructure  any of which could have a material adverse affect on the company s future operations 
at june  the company was committed to approximately million of capital expenditures to be made in fiscal impact of year general description of the year issue and the nature and effects of the year on information technology it and non it systems the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications or replacements of existing software and certain hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following five phases inventorying year items  assessing the year compliance of items determined to be material to the company  repairing or replacing material items that are determined not to be year compliant  testing material items  and implementation 
to date  the company has completed all phases 
the non it systems were assessed and are not material to the company s operations 
for example  the company s engineers have reviewed the company s significant products and do not believe there is any date sensitive software included in products sold by the company since some products sold by omni entertainment  a company acquired in  may have date sensitive chips which may result in incorrect date displays 
the company has notified these customers of this concern and has provided the necessary tools to test their equipment 
the company has not incurred material costs to test or correct products initially sold by the company 
status of progress in becoming year compliant  including timetable for completion of each remaining phase on may   the company went live with its new general ledger  billing and inventory system modules 
there will be an ongoing implementation of other modules the company felt were of less critical nature 
nature and level of importance of third parties and their exposure to the year the company does not interface directly with third party vendors with regard to shared information systems 
the company has queried its significant suppliers and subcontractors that do not share information systems with the company external agents 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
costs the company has utilized both internal and external resources to replace  test  and implement the software and certain hardware for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project was approximately  of which  was capitalized and approximately  was expensed 
risks management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has completed the final phase of the year program 
however  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in this year disclosure should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading  special note on forward looking statements  beginning on page above 
readers should understand that the dates on which the company believes the year project will be completed are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the company s year compliance project 
specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced  and other similar uncertainties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties and the inter connection of national and international businesses  the company cannot ensure its ability to timely and cost effectively resolve problems associated with the year issue which may affect its business operations  or expose it to third party liability 
risk factors we have a history of losses and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitable operations in fiscal we have not been profitable in four of the last five years and have an aggregate net loss for the last five years of million 
during  we incurred a net loss of million 
because a substantial portion of our expenses are fixed and our gross margin is relatively low  achieving profitability depends upon our ability to generate and sustain substantially higher revenues 
although we have implemented plans to increase revenues and operating margin  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so and consequently may have additional losses in fiscal if our cash on hand and short term investments  together with cash generated by operations  cannot sufficiently fund future operating losses and capital requirements  we may be required to raise additional funds 
additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
it is possible that our current film software may not sustain its popularity and our new film software may not become popular 
a substantial portion of our revenue is dependent upon the production and distribution of entertainment and educational film software for exhibition on our theatre systems 
each production is an individual artistic work 
we try to develop and produce film software that will achieve high market acceptance 
however  market acceptance depends upon many factors beyond our control  including o audience reaction  o competing programming  o other forms of entertainment  o perceived quality of programming 
we cannot assure you that our film software will obtain market acceptance 
if our film software becomes less popular  we will most likely derive less revenue from the license of our film library and from new hardware sales 
our competitive position is dependent on continuing to invest in new film productions 
if we are unable to do so  it could have a negative impact on out revenues 
we believe that our extensive library of popular films is a competitive advantage and that we must continue to add to this library if we are to be successful 
film production is expensive 
we generally spend   to produce a film 
although we try to reduce the financial impact of a new film by entering into licensing  participation or other financing arrangements with third parties  prior to release we typically do not recoup our costs until years later 
even if we are able to reduce the costs of production  we cannot assure you that the films we produce and acquire will be popular 
in addition  because our cash balances have continued to decline  we have had to decrease the level of our investment in film software and this may have an adverse impact on our revenues in future periods 
we have significant amounts recorded on our balance sheet as film inventory and if our cost or revenue estimates were to change we could be required to write down all or a portion of these unamortized costs 
we follow financial accounting standards board statement no 
 financial reporting by producers and distributors of motion picture films  regarding revenue recognition and amortization of production costs for films in which we own or control all applicable rights 
we capitalize as film inventory all costs incurred in connection with an individual film  including acquisition  development  production and allocable production overhead costs and interest 
if our revenue or cost estimates change with respect to a particular film  we may be required to write down all or a portion of the unamortized cost for such a film 
we cannot assure you that such write downs  if they occur  will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our financial condition 
our principal competitors devote greater financial  personnel and marketing resources to the development and expansion of competitive products 
we face significant competition in each of the markets in which we operate 
our principal direct competition for customers comes from manufacturers of competing movie based attractions  and in the case of amusement and theme parks  manufacturers of traditional amusement park attractions 
in addition  there is also competition from systems integrators and some amusement and theme parks developing and constructing their own attractions 
we have significantly fewer financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than certain of our competitors and these limited resources may harm our business in many ways 
our competitors may leverage their greater resources to o develop  manufacture and market products that are less expensive or technologically superior to our products  o reach a wider array of potential customers through increased marketing and sales activities  o attend more trade shows and spend more on advertising and marketing  o operate at lower margins for longer periods  o respond more quickly to new or changing technologies  customer requirements and standards  or o reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share 
in addition  the out of home entertainment industry in general is undergoing significant changes  primarily due to technological developments as well as changing consumer tastes 
many companies are developing and are expected to develop new entertainment products or concepts in response to these developments that may be directly competitive with our products 
we believe these competitive pressures are likely to continue 
we cannot guarantee that our resources will be sufficient to address this competition or that we will manage costs and adopt strategies capable of effectively utilizing our resources 
if we are unable to respond to competitive pressures successfully  our prices and profit margins may fall and our market share may decrease 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate changes in technology and develop new and enhanced products on a timely and cost effective basis 
we operate in a technology driven segment of the entertainment industry 
consequently  it is important for us to develop new and enhanced products in response to technological changes 
risks inherent in the development and introduction of new products include o difficulty in forecasting customer demand accurately  o our inability to expand capacity fast enough to meet customer demand  o the possibility that new products may cannibalize current products  o delays or interruptions in the manufacture and installation of new products  o competitors responses to our introduction of new products  o the desire by customers to evaluate new products for longer periods of time before making a purchase decision  and o the possibility the market may reject certain new technology and products 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop products in a timely manner or the products or product enhancements that we develop do not achieve market acceptance  our business could be harmed 
a significant portion of our sales and customers are located outside the united states 
currency fluctuations and the increased costs associated with international sales  could make our products unaffordable in foreign markets  which could reduce our profitability 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales 
our foreign sales subject us to a number of risks including o although we denominate our international sales in us dollars  currency fluctuations could make our products unaffordable to foreign purchasers or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers  o greater difficulty of administering business overseas may increase the costs of foreign sales and support  o foreign governments may impose tariffs  quotas and taxes on our products  o longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable may reduce the profitability of foreign sales  o political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or our ability to market our products  o restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets  and o although we have met certain international manufacturing standards  our lack of iso certification  a widely accepted method of establishing and certifying the technical characteristics and quality of our products  may hinder our foreign sales 
these risks may increase our costs of doing business internationally and reduce our sales or profitability 
we are dependent on the strength of the national and international economies 
recessionary or deflationary conditions in any or our principal markets could reduce our sales and profitability 
our revenues and profitability are dependent on the strength of the national and international economies 
in a recessionary or deflationary environment  sales of our products may be adversely affected 
theme parks and other out of home entertainment venues may also experience a downturn in sales which could reduce the funds available for capital improvements and film licensing  resulting in price and other concessions and discounts by us in order to maintain sales activity 
for example  recent turmoil in the economies of the countries in asia have had a material adverse affect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
revenues attributable to sales in asia declined from million for fiscal representing of the company s revenues to million in fiscal representing of the company s revenues 
sales to asia have increased in fiscal  as local economies recovered 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
if revenues and operating results fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter to quarter  our stock prices may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
as a result  we believe that the period to period comparison for operating results are not necessarily reliable indicators of our future performance 
a variety of factors may affect our operating results  including factors which are outside our control 
these factors include the following o the size and timing of customer orders  o the timing or introduction of enhancement of products by us or our competitors  o the timing and level of our operating expenses 
any anticipated change in operating results may cause our stock prices to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information for investors and analysts 
new information causes investors and analysts to revalue our stock and this in the aggregate could cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our customers have the right to terminate their contracts with us in certain circumstances 
terminations may reduce our sales and revenues 
our hardware sales contracts typically provide that the customer may terminate our contract upon payment of certain costs at any time prior to delivery 
we also provide warranty service at a one year interval for our customers on our products 
we estimate and reserve for potential cancellations and warranty service in our reported financial statements 
the costs resulting from actual cancellations and or warranty service could exceed our estimates 
if the number of cancellations or the costs of warranty service exceed our estimates  our financial results could be harmed for the periods during which such returns or service are made 
if we are sued on a product liability claim  our insurance policies may not be sufficient 
although we maintain general liability insurance and product liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential all types of product liability claims to which manufacturors are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our business 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately  the advantages of our research  manufacturing and distribution systems may be reduced as competitors adopt some or all of these techniques 
since our business depends in part on intellectual property rights  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology in creative works 
we currently hold several patents on the design elements of our products and also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  copyright and other intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary rights 
such rights  however  may not preclude competitors from developing products that are essentially equivalent or superior to ours 
in addition  may aspects of our product are not subject to intellectual property protection and therefore may be reproduced by our competitors 
intellectual property infringement claims against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend and may harm our business 
in recent years there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
while we currently are not engaged in any material intellectual property litigation or proceedings  we may become involved in the future 
an adverse outcome of litigation could force us to do one or more of the following o stop selling  incorporating or using our products for services that use the challenged intellectual property  o subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  o obtain from the owners of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  or o redesign those products and services that use such technology  which redesign may be either economically or technologically infeasible 
whether or not an intellectual property litigation claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses in the diversion of management resources  could harm our business 
the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock and our stockholder rights plan may make takeover attempts difficult or impossible 
our board of directors has the authority  without any action of the shareholders  to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares 
in addition  we have in place a stockholders rights plan 
the ability of our board to issue preferred stock and or the stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price  and the voting and rights of the holders of our common stock 
our business and the business of our suppliers could be adversely affected by computer errors or failures associated with the year problem 
the year readiness issue  which is common to most businesses  arises from the inability of information systems  and other time and date sensitive products and systems  to properly recognize the process date sensitive information or system failures 
estimates of the potential costs and effects of year issues vary significantly among businesses  and it is extremely difficult to predict the actual impact 
recognizing this uncertainty  management is continuing to actively analyze  assess and plan for various year issues across our business 
the year issue has an impact on both information and technology systems and non it systems  such as manufacturing systems and physical facilities including  but not limited to  securities systems and utilities 
although our management believes that all of our mission critical systems are not affected by the year issue  there can be no assurance that we will not experience some problems 
non it system issues are more difficult to identify and resolve 
we are actively identifying non it year issues concerning our products or services as well as our physical facilities 
as non it areas are identified  our management formulates the necessary actions to ensure minimal disruption to our business processes 
although our management believes that its efforts will be successful and the costs will be immateriality our consolidated financial position and results of operations  it also recognizes that any failure or delay could cause a potential adverse impact 
the year readiness of our customers varies 
we are not investigating whether or not our customers are evaluating and or preparing their own systems 
these efforts by customers to address the year issues may affect the demand for certain products and services  however  the impact on our revenue is highly uncertain 
we have also begun to assess the year readiness of our key suppliers and business partners 
our direction of this effort is to ensure the adequacy of resources and supplies to minimize any potential business interruptions 
the year issue presents a number of other risks and uncertainties that could impact us  such as public utility failures  potential claims against us for damages arising from products or services that are not year compliant  and the responsibility of certain government commissions of the various geographic areas where we conduct our business 
while we continue to believe that the year issues described above will not materially affect our financial position  it remains uncertain as to what extent  if any  we may be impacted 
if we  our customers or vendors are unable to resolve any year compliance problems in a timely manner  we could face business interruptions or shutdowns  financial loss  regulatory actions  reputational harm and or legal liability 
contingency plans that address a reasonable likely worse case scenario have not yet been developed 
we intend to determine whether any such plans will be necessary in the coming months
