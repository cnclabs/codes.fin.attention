certain statements contained in this discussion and analysis which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  customer demand and trends in the arts and crafts industry  related inventory risks due to shifts in customer demand  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitors locations or pricing  the availability of acceptable real estate locations for new stores  difficulties with respect to new information system technologies and our ability to address the year issue  supply constraints or difficulties  the results of financing efforts and other risks detailed in our securities and exchange commission filings 
general in fiscal years  and  we added  and michaels stores  respectively  and closed  and  respectively 
during and  a substantial portion of our sales increases came from stores added during or after the prior comparable period and therefore are not included in same store sales comparisons 
during these periods  sales from these newer stores accounted for approximately and  respectively  of aggregate sales growth increases 
during we focused on implementing initiatives to improve our merchandising and store operations  which included completing the installation of the point of sale pos system  redefining the merchandise strategy  liquidating merchandise which did not support our focus toward return on capital  resetting and standardizing the stores  and improving store staffing effectiveness 
these changes allowed us to focus on an expanded arts and crafts assortment as our core line of business 
in we moderated our expansion plans and focused on same store sales growth  return on investment  productivity enhancements and improving cash flow 
we increased the number of basic merchandise skus centrally purchased and available for store replenishment from our distribution centers  and we have continued this process into with a goal of having approximately  skus available by year end 
we believe that shifting more skus for inventory replenishment to the distribution centers will result in an increase in inventory turns in future years 
in we continued our focus on growing same store sales  implemented information system enhancements in merchandising and distribution  and returned to an accelerated new store opening program 
in addition  we positioned the company for significant operating improvements in future years by putting new inventory management tools in place 
initiatives for include focusing on four cornerstones essential to our operational turnaround for top line growth an enhanced version of our store prototype  effective distribution centers  continued information system enhancements  and disciplined inventory management and control to ensure we improve store in stock positions while reducing store inventories 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of our consolidated statements of operations 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes 
fiscal year net sales cost of sales and occupancy expense gross margin selling  general and administrative expense store pre opening costs operating income loss interest expense other income and expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in the fiscal year ended january  increased million  or  over the fiscal year ended january  
the results for included sales from michaels and aaron brothers stores that were opened during the year  more than offsetting lost sales from michaels and aaron brothers store closures 
same store sales increased in the improvement in same store sales was due to a good performance in memory books  wood  beads  candles  art  books and yarn  more than offsetting the performance in apparel crafts  seasonal  needlecrafts and ribbon 
going forward we expect to achieve same store sales increases for  taken as a whole 
our ability to generate same store sales increases is dependent  in part  on our ability to continue to improve store in stock positions on the top selling items  to properly allocate seasonal merchandise to the stores based upon anticipated sales trends utilizing pos rate of sale information and the success of our sales promotion efforts 
cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  for was  a decrease of compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to improvements in the initial markup and cost reductions in merchandise purchases  partially offset by increased occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales  including higher rent reserves for store closures 
selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by in compared to this decrease resulted from improved expense leverage in corporate general and administrative expense  advertising and depreciation 
store pre opening costs  as a percentage of net sales  increased by in compared to  as we opened or relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores compared to michaels and aaron brothers stores in the prior year 
interest expense  as a percentage of net sales  was for  a decrease of compared to the prior year 
this decrease was a result of leveraging the fixed interest costs over a larger sales base 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in increased million  or  over the fiscal year ended february  
the results for included sales from michaels and aaron brothers stores that were opened during the year  partially offsetting lost sales from michaels and aaron brothers store closures 
same store sales for comparable week reporting periods increased in the improvement in same store sales was due to a strong performance in the core categories of general crafts  framing  art supplies and floral  which management believes was the result of updated planograms and improved information from the new pos item sales history database initiated during the summer of cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  for was  a decrease of compared to cost of sales and occupancy expense in included a million charge for unusual costs and expenses recorded in the third quarter of to cover losses on an extended sidewalk sale  markdowns on discounted furniture and certain other home decor merchandise  and reserves for the closure of stores and the write down of leasehold improvements in stores 
adjusting for the unusual items  cost of sales and occupancy expense for decreased by compared to the prior year 
this decrease was principally due to improved gross margins which management attributes to decreased dependency on promotional advertising and fewer seasonal clearance markdowns in the third and fourth quarters of selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by in compared to this decrease resulted from a reduction in advertising costs of million from levels and improved expense leverage in store labor and all other categories of store operating expenses with the exception of depreciation  which reflects the impact of increased investment in the pos system 
additionally  in the third quarter of we recorded a million charge associated with unusual costs and expenses relating primarily to an extended sidewalk sale 
interest expense  as a percentage of net sales  was for  a slight increase of compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily a result of interest expense on the million of senior notes issued in june which was  for the first time  outstanding for the full year in for the effective tax rate increased to from in as we returned to profitability 
the effective tax rate was significantly lower due to the loss in and our inability to fully carryback the tax losses to prior years 
liquidity and capital resources we plan to spend approximately million on capital expenditures during fiscal we plan to open michaels and aaron brothers stores for approximately million  of which michaels and aaron brothers stores have been opened as of april  in march we acquired leases for stores included in the michaels stores noted above  formerly operated by mjdesigns  inc  for million 
we expect to spend approximately million on information systems  million on store relocations and remodeling  and million on various other projects 
we believe that our available cash  funds generated by operating activities  funds available under a bank credit agreement  lease financing and proceeds from the sale of stock should be sufficient to finance continuing operations and sustain current growth plans 
we believe that we can finance annual store expansion at a rate of from internally generated cash flow 
our working capital needs are driven primarily by a seasonal buildup of inventory to support higher sales in the third and fourth quarters  funding required for growth in new stores and improvements in our information systems 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million as compared to million for  decreasing primarily as a result of an increase in merchandise inventories 
inventories per michaels store increased as a result of increasing the number of items replenished by our distribution centers from approximately  at year end to approximately  at year end additional inventory was required for the opening of new stores in and and as the store in stock position of top selling merchandise in existing stores was improved 
capital expenditures during were million net of million in proceeds from sale leaseback transactions  incurred primarily for the opening  relocation or expansion of stores  the relocation of a distribution center and various enhancements to our information systems 
in october we began issuing common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the stock purchase plan 
the stock purchase plan provides owners of shares of common stock and other interested investors with a convenient and economical method to purchase common stock 
the stock purchase plan also provides us with a cost efficient and flexible mechanism to raise equity capital 
in october we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million and placed the shares in treasury 
at january   we had working capital of million  compared to million at january  we currently have a bank credit agreement providing for an unsecured revolving line of credit of million  which may be increased to million under specific conditions 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the previous revolving line of credit at any time during  and in borrowings under the current bank credit agreement were outstanding for days during our peak season of seasonal inventory buildup 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature with higher sales in the third and fourth quarters 
historically  the fourth quarter  which includes the christmas selling season  has accounted for approximately of our sales and excluding and approximately of our operating income 
we believe that the effects of inflation on results and the projected effect on financial results will be nominal 
impact of the year we are highly dependent on our internal information systems for tracking inventory and sales information and on our vendors systems for assuring accurate and timely deliveries of goods to our distribution centers and stores 
because we have invested substantial amounts of money and effort in updating internal systems in recent years  we believe such systems are already substantially year compliant 
we have implemented a comprehensive plan designed to make our operations fully year compliant  utilizing both internal and external resources 
a corporate project office has been established to oversee  monitor and coordinate the company wide year efforts 
an experienced consulting firm has been engaged to provide objective project management and technical expertise to assist us in the completion of the project 
our information systems include proprietary and third party application systems and related hardware  software and data and telephone networks 
approximately of our application systems are presently believed to be year compliant 
remediation or replacement of the majority of our remaining systems is in process  with substantial completion anticipated by mid the testing and certification stage for these areas is targeted to be largely completed by the end of the third quarter we believe that we are on schedule to complete year compliance plans with respect to our information systems 
we are currently assessing business equipment and systems  such as elevators and security systems  which contain embedded computer technology 
based on our preliminary assessment and assurances from third parties  we believe these systems present little year exposure or risk 
we have surveyed our mission critical merchandise and service vendors to determine their year status and are in the process of obtaining appropriate assurances from these vendors 
in addition  we are conducting more detailed assessments of the progress of our electronic data interchange trading partners 
in  our top ten vendors accounted for approximately of total purchases  with no single merchandise vendor accounting for more than of total purchases  thus  we do not believe any single vendor poses a significant risk 
we have completed the assessment phase with respect to vendors systems 
we are developing contingency plans  such as alternative sourcing  and identifying what actions would need to be taken if critical systems or service providers are not year compliant 
we expect these plans to be finalized by mid currently  we do not expect that substantial increases in inventory will be required as a contingency measure 
we have begun  but not yet completed  a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from our failure or the failure of certain third parties to complete efforts to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
a contingency plan has not been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  and such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
we currently plan to complete such analysis and contingency plan by mid despite significant efforts to make our systems and facilities year compliant  the ability of third party service providers  vendors and certain other third parties  including governmental entities and utility companies  to be year compliant is beyond our control 
accordingly  we can give no assurances that the systems of other parties on which our systems or operations rely will be timely converted or compatible with our systems 
the failure of these entities to comply on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect 
at the present time  however  we do not expect year issues to materially affect our products  services  competitive position  or financial performance or condition 
total external non capitalizable costs related to the year effort exclusive of the costs of planned development of new systems are estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million has been incurred through january in addition  we have accelerated the planned development of new information systems with improved business functionality to replace systems that were not year compliant 
the cost of these new information systems will approximate million  of which approximately million has been incurred prior to the date of this report 
our year costs  including the acceleration of development of new systems already planned  have been  and are expected to be  funded with cash flow from operating activities 
we do not separately track internal direct costs associated with the utilization of our officers and employees in year compliance efforts 
no significant information system projects have been deferred because of the year effort 
the foregoing statements as to cost and timetables relating to the year effort are forward looking and are made in reliance on the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of they are based on our best estimates  which may be updated as additional information becomes available 
forward looking statements are also based on assumptions about many important factors  including the technical skills of employees and independent contractors  the representations and preparedness of third parties  the ability of vendors to deliver merchandise or perform services required by us and the collateral effects of the year issues on our business partners and customers 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  we caution that it is impossible to predict the impact of certain factors that could cause actual costs or timetables to differ materially from those expected

the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at january   approximated carrying value 
the interest rates on our revolving line of credit are repriced frequently  at market rates  which would result in carrying amounts that approximate fair value 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at january  we believe that the effect  if any  of possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
the fair value of our senior notes and convertible subordinated notes long term debt was estimated to be million at january  and was million less than carrying value 
generally  the fair value of our fixed interest rate long term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the interest rates used by the dealers to quote the fair value of our long term debt at january   which would result in an increase in fair value of approximately million
