market risk sensitive instruments and positions the risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see note o to the consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
in order to provide a measure of control over price and supply  the company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight operations 
the company also manages the price risk of fuel costs primarily utilizing futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel based on projected fuel usage which would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  net of gains realized from fuel hedge instruments outstanding at december   compared to an estimated million at december  as of december   the company had hedged approximately of its fuel requirements  including of the first quarter  compared to and  respectively  at december  foreign currency 
the company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
the company s largest exposure comes from the japanese yen 
from time to time  the company uses financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the japanese yen 
the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december  levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company s revenues and expenses are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the year ending december   net of gains realized from yen hedge instruments outstanding at december   compared to an estimated million decrease at december  this is due to the company s foreign currency denominated revenues exceeding its foreign currency denominated expenses 
the increase to other income due to the remeasurement of net foreign currency denominated liabilities and the increase to common stockholders equity deficit due to the translation of net yen denominated liabilities resulting from a strengthening in the value of the us dollar is not material for and this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as of december  and in  the company s yen denominated revenues exceeded its yen denominated expenses by approximately billion yen approximately million and its yen denominated liabilities exceeded its yen denominated assets by an average of billion yen million 
in general  each time the yen strengthens weakens  the company s operating income is favorably unfavorably impacted due to net yen denominated revenue exceeding expenses and a nonoperating foreign currency loss gain is recognized due to the remeasurement of net yen denominated liabilities 
the company s operating income was negatively impacted by approximately million due to the average yen being weaker in compared to and million due to the average yen being weaker in compared to the yen to us dollar exchange rate at december   and was yen to  yen to and yen to  respectively 
there was no material impact on earnings associated with the japanese yen put options purchased to hedge its net yen denominated cash flows 
as of december   the company had entered into forward contracts to hedge approximately of its yen denominated ticket sales  which also represents approximately of the company s excess of yen denominated revenues over expenses 
interest 
the company s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash equivalents and short term investments and its interest expense from floating rate debt instruments 
the company has mitigated this risk by limiting its floating rate indebtedness to approximately and of long term debt and capital leases at december  and  respectively 
if long term interest rates average more in than they did during  the company s net interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured at december  if short term interest rates average more in than they did during  the company s interest income from cash equivalents and short term investments would increase by approximately million compared to an estimated million for measured at december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s floating rate indebtedness  cash equivalent and short term investment balances at december  market risk for fixed rate indebtedness is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million during  compared to an estimated million for measured at december  for the fair values of the company s indebtedness were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
other information income taxes 
sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and treasury regulations limit the amounts of net operating losses nols  alternative minimum tax net operating losses amtnols and credits that can be used to offset taxable income or used as a credit in any single tax year if the corporation experiences more than a ownership change  as defined therein  over a three year testing period ending on the testing date 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding income taxes and nols  amtnols and credits 
management believes that an offering of outstanding common stock by existing stockholders in november triggered an ownership change  but that no ownership change occurred before that time 
if such an ownership change did occur as a result of the offering  management believes that  even as limited by the code  the company would use the nols  amtnols and credits significantly earlier than their expiration  and the annual limitation would not adversely impact the company 
however  if the internal revenue service the irs were to successfully assert that an ownership change had occurred on any date prior to november including august  when the company entered into labor agreements that provided stock for labor cost savings  the company s ability to use its nols  amtnols and credits would be significantly impaired because the value of nwa corp s stock on certain prior testing dates was relatively low 
such value would adversely affect the annual limitation 
year readiness 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits to identify the applicable year and not taking into account the change in century that will occur in the year as a result  such systems may fail completely or create erroneous results when the year is defined by the system as the company uses a significant number of information technology it and non it embedded operating systems systems that are essential to its operations 
as a result  the company implemented a year project to modify its computer systems to function properly in and in the years after that 
the year project is being coordinated through a senior level task force that reports periodically to senior management and the board of directors 
the company is also reviewing the year readiness of third parties with whom the company s systems interface and exchange data or upon whom the company s business depends and is coordinating efforts with these outside third parties to minimize the extent to which its business will be vulnerable to such third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company s business is also dependent upon us and foreign governmental agencies and certain governmental organizations or entities  which provide essential aviation industry infrastructure  such as the federal aviation administration faa 
there can be no assurance that the systems of such third parties on which the company s business relies including those of the faa will be modified on a timely basis 
as part of this review  the company is actively involved in airline industry year review efforts led by the air transport association and the international air transport association 
the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of its systems or equipment to operate properly beyond  or failure of those operated by other parties such as the air traffic control and related systems of the faa and international aviation and local airport authorities 
the five phases of the company s year project used for identifying and modifying the various programs and systems include inventory  assessment  conversion  testing and implementation 
the company has completed all phases for of its internal it systems and anticipates completion of the remaining systems in the first quarter of the company is approximately completed with the assessment phase of the impact of year on its non it systems and third party relationships  which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of with all phases anticipated to be completed in to some extent  the company s readiness in this area is dependent on the readiness of third parties 
as a precautionary measure  the company is also developing entity wide contingency plans designed to allow continued operation in the event of failure of the company s or third parties systems 
contingency plans are expected to be in place by the end of the second quarter of and are expected to be executed as necessary 
the company has spent million of its initial estimated cost of million  of which million has been spent and expensed during the company now estimates that the total project costs will be somewhat less than the estimated million 
the costs associated with the year project are being funded through cash from operations and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition or results from operations 
maintenance or modification costs associated with making existing computer systems year compliant will be expensed as incurred 
a majority of the estimated total year compliance cost has been funded by reallocating existing resources rather than incurring incremental costs 
the costs of the company s year project and the date on which the company believes it will be completed are based on management s best estimates and include assumptions regarding third party modification plans 
however  in particular due to the potential impact of third party modification plans  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
this section captioned year readiness is a year readiness disclosure as defined in section of the year information and readiness disclosure act  public law  enacted in october the euro

costs associated with the euro project were accounted for in accordance with the existing accounting policies and funded through cash from operations 
management does not believe the implementation of this single currency plan will have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition or results from operations 
us transportation taxes 
the united states passenger ticket tax and other transportation taxes  which were reinstated in the first quarter of  expired on september  the taxpayer relief act enacted by congress revised transportation taxes and instituted new taxes for tickets for travel from october  to december  over a five year period on a sliding scale  the passenger ticket tax will be reduced from percent to percent and a per passenger segment fee will be phased in 
the fee for international arrivals and departures was increased from per departure to for each arrival and departure 
the departure tax on travel between the us states and alaska or hawaii remained at additionally  a percent tax was added on the purchase of frequent flyer miles
