the company expects its operations  including acquisitions and drilling prospects  will be financed by funds provided from operations  working capital  various cost sharing arrangements  borrowings under its line of credit or from other financing alternatives 
historically  oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 
prices are affected by  among other things  market supply and demand factors  market uncertainty  and actions of the united states and foreign governments and international cartels 
these factors are beyond the control of the company 
during  lower oil and natural gas prices adversely impacted revenues  earnings and cash flows 
to the extent that oil and gas prices decline  the company s revenues  cash flows  earnings and operations would be adversely impacted 
the company is unable to accurately predict future oil and natural gas prices 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer applications being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as the year approaches  such applications may be unable to accurately process certain date based information 
the company believes it has identified the significant internal computer applications that will require modification to ensure year compliance 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required modifications and test compliance 
modification and compliance is proceeding as scheduled and the company expects that the modifications should be completed by june  at that time  the company s internal computer applications are expected to be year compliant 
an assessment of the readiness of third parties with whom the company does business  such as customers and vendors  is ongoing

the company s operations would be impacted by various third parties abilities to be year compliant 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company has not yet determined the potential adverse effect that year risks may have on its financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the company s program is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about year issues and  in particular  about year compliance and readiness of its third party vendors and associates 
the company believes that  with the modification of its business systems and completion of its assessment program as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
the cost of year compliance has not been specifically tracked but is not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations in any given year 
to mitigate year compliance issues at year end  the company will back up all internal computer data to ensure the ability to restore that information 
the company will have hard copies of all important internal computer information and hard copies of the detail of any assets held by third parties such as banks and investment brokers 
if the company is unable to produce its wells or transport or sell its production due to year compliance issues  wells will be shut in until normal operations can be resumed

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks relate to changes in the prices received from sales of oil and natural gas 
the company s primary risk management strategy is to partially mitigate the risk of adverse changes in its cash flows caused by deceases in oil and natural gas prices by entering into derivative commodity instruments  including commodity futures contracts and price swaps 
by hedging only a portion of its market risk exposures  the company is able to participate in the increased earnings and cash flows associated with increases in oil and natural gas prices  however  it is exposed to risk on the unhedged portion of its oil and natural gas production 
historically  the company has attempted to hedge the exposure related to its forecasted oil and natural gas production in amounts which it believes are prudent based on the prices of available derivatives and  in the case of production hedges  the company s deliverable volumes 
the company does not use or hold derivative instruments for trading purposes nor does it use derivative instruments with leveraged features 
the company s derivative instruments are designed and effective as hedges against its identified risks  and do not of themselves expose the company to market risk because any adverse change in the cash flows associated with the derivative instrument is accompanied by an offsetting change in the cash flows of the hedged transaction 
notes and to the financial statements provide further disclosure with respect to derivatives and related accounting policies 
all derivative activity is carried out by personnel who have appropriate skills  experience and supervision 
the personnel involved in derivative activity must follow prescribed trading limits and parameters that are regularly reviewed by the company s chief executive officer 
all hedges or open positions are reviewed by the chief executive officer before they are committed to  and significant positions are reviewed by the company s board of directors 
the company uses only well known  conventional derivative instruments and attempts to manage its credit risk by entering into financial contracts with reputable financial institutions 
following are disclosures regarding the company s market risk instruments 
investors and other users are cautioned to avoid simplistic use of these disclosures 
users should realize that the actual impact of future commodity price movements will likely differ from the amounts disclosed below due to ongoing changes in risk exposure levels and concurrent adjustments to hedging positions 
it is not possible to accurately predict future movements in oil and natural gas prices 
the company periodically hedges a portion of the price risk associated with the sale of its oil and natural gas production through the use of derivative commodity instruments  which consist of commodity futures contracts and price swaps 
these instruments reduce the company s exposure to decreases in oil and natural gas prices on the hedged portion of its production by enabling it to effectively receive a fixed price on its oil and natural gas sales 
the company had no derivative commodity instruments in place as of march  during  the company sold  barrels of oil 
a hypothetical decrease of per barrel of year end prices would decrease the company s production revenues by  during  assuming that oil production remains at levels 
the company sold bcf of natural gas in a hypothetical decrease of 
per mcf of year end prices would decrease the company s production revenues by  for  assuming that natural gas production remains at levels
