item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  the related notes thereto and our audited financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview on october   we acquired  at the time of our initial public offering  brewer personnel services  inc and the other five founding companies 
based on the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 brewer was designated as the acquirer of the other founding companies for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  our results of operations for only include the operations of the other founding companies for the period following their acquisition on october  the acquisition of assets and the assumption of liabilities of the founding companies are reflected at their historical cost based on the applicable provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
our services are provided through two segments professional it and commercial 
the professional it segment provides staffing  consulting  technical support and solutions services primarily in the areas of finance  accounting  information technology  and legal services 
the commercial segment provides clerical and light industrial staffing services 
our services are provided through our network of over branch offices located in states and countries including the united states  the united kingdom  australia  germany  new zealand  belgium  holland  singapore  and south africa 
revenues are recognized upon the performance of services 
we generally compensate our professionals and associates only for hours actually worked and  therefore  wages of professionals and associates are a variable cost that increase or decrease as revenues increase or decrease 
however  we do have professionals that are full time  salaried employees who are paid even when not engaged in staffing or consulting 
cost of services primarily consists of wages paid to professionals  temporary associates  payroll taxes  workers compensation  foreign statutory taxes  national insurance and other related employee benefits 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of administrative salaries and benefits  marketing  rent  recruitment  training  it systems and communications expenses 
during  we completed business combinations 
on november   we completed the acquisition of robert walters 
our largest acquisition to date  robert walters specializes in placing accounting  finance and it professionals on a contract  temporary and permanent basis with customers in the finance  commercial and industrial sectors 
this acquisition complemented our existing business lines by providing a value added  high margin international professional services component with a significant presence in the united kingdom 
for the year ended december   robert walters had approximately million of revenue 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests  with  shares of our common stock being issued to the robert walters stockholders 
the financial statements have been restated for the significant pooling of interests business combinations 
our operating results include acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method since the effective date of acquisition 
we incurred million in nonrecurring merger costs and one time charges during primarily related to our pooling of interests business combinations and the reassessment of recoverability of certain assets 
approximately million of these nonrecurring merger expenses related to the robert walters transaction 
these nonrecurring costs consist primarily of professional fees  printing fees  fees of financial advisors  integration expenses including the elimination of redundant offices  severance plans and other contract terminations 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is included in the following discussion because we believe the year to year change in ebitda is a meaningful measure since we have been an acquisitive company and the non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization have a significant impact on operating income and operating margins 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative measure of the amount of our income or cash flows from operating activities as ebitda excludes certain significant costs of doing business 
the ebitda per share information that follows has been calculated using diluted shares outstanding for the relevant period 
recent information on march   based on a detailed review of january results and an accelerated review of preliminary february results  we announced that a decline in demand from our finance  banking and legal clients and lower growth from intellimark s domestic it staffing business could cause our earnings per share for the first quarter of and the year to be lower than the pre announcement i b e s consensus analyst estimate for each of these periods 
in response to this circumstance  we implemented executive and organizational changes at intellimark for the purpose of improving it staffing growth rates  consolidating administrative functions and building an it solutions network that compliments our business units and core competencies 
to focus our efforts in these areas  we plan to slow down our acquisition program during the balance of the year 
financial information the financial information provided below has been rounded in order to simplify its presentation 
the percentages below have been calculated using the detailed financial information contained in the financial statements  the notes thereto and the other financial data included in this annual report on form k

consolidated revenues increased million  or  to billion for compared to million for the acquisitions completed during in both the professional it and commercial segments accounted for approximately million of the increase 
approximately million of the increase is the result of recording a full year s operations in for the companies purchased during which consists of both internal and acquisition growth

ebitda and gross profit 
ebitda  excluding nonrecurring charges  increased million  or  to million for as compared to million for ebitda  excluding nonrecurring charges  as a percentage of revenues was for and for this margin improvement was the result of our efforts to increase our concentration in the higher margin professional it business  somewhat offset by higher stock option compensation expense in compared to  as discussed below 
including nonrecurring charges  ebitda was million and ebitda margin was 
for  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from to while selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  excluding nonrecurring charges  as a percentage of revenue decreased from to 
the increase in gross profit and gross profit margin primarily resulted from higher revenues and an increased percentage of revenues being derived from the professional it segment which generally has higher profit margins than the commercial segment  in conjunction with an increase in robert walters permanent placement revenues in we will continue to invest in the infrastructure of our company in the areas of technology  training  communications and marketing as we believe these investments will provide valuable benefits in the future 
sg a for and includes amounts related to the robert walters stock option plan which were compensatory prior to the acquisition but which became subject to fixed plan accounting as of the acquisition date 
these compensatory stock option plans resulted in income of million in and expense of million in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for this increase is primarily attributable to amortization of goodwill associated with our purchase business combinations 
depreciation also increased as a result of continuing development of our corporate infrastructure and information systems network 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the same period last year 
due to nonrecurring charges of million  our operating margin decreased to for as compared to for excluding these nonrecurring charges  consolidated operating income was million  or of consolidated revenues 
the following operating income discussion at the professional it and commercial segment levels excludes unallocated corporate sg a of million for and million for operating income for the professional it segment increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the professional it segment benefited from an increase in operating margin from in to in partially as a result of lower compensation expenses related to the robert walters compensatory stock options in the higher margin business involving consulting and solutions services  along with an increase in robert walters permanent placement business were the primary reasons for the margin increase 
the domestic acquisitions completed during provided approximately million in operating income 
operating income for the commercial segment increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the same period last year 
continued growth in our existing markets  increases in our strategic alliance vendor on premise agreements as well as the strategic acquisitions completed during the year have provided the majority of this growth 
commercial acquisitions completed during the year added operating income of approximately million 
the growth from our strategic alliances  which provide clients with dedicated on site account management  tend to have lower gross margins than traditional temporary staffing services 
however  the higher volumes  comparatively lower operating expenses and relatively long term contracts associated with these relationships have resulted in operating profit growth and a stable source of revenue 
the operating margin of the commercial segment increased from in to in interest expense 
we incurred interest expense of million in as compared to million of interest expense in interest expense in both periods is primarily related to borrowings on our credit facility as defined below to fund the cash portion of several of our acquisitions 
net income 
net income  excluding nonrecurring charges  increased to million for as compared to million for the same period last year 
this increase of million is a result of the factors described above 
net margin  excluding nonrecurring charges  was for up from for including nonrecurring charges  net income for was million and net income as a percentage of revenue was 
results for the year ended december  compared to results for the year ended december  revenues 
consolidated revenues increased million  or  to million for compared to million for this increase was primarily attributable to the full year s operations of the other five founding companies  the acquisitions completed during of approximately million  and internal growth  particularly in the finance  accounting and it areas of robert walters 
revenues for the professional it segment increased million  or  to million for compared to million for this increase is primarily the result of our focus on acquiring and developing our professional it segment which tends to have higher margins and growth rates than the traditional commercial business 
at the end of  the professional it segment constituted of our revenue base 
the professional it companies purchased in provided approximately million of the increase 
revenues for the commercial segment increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the largest driver of this change relates to the inclusion of the other five founding companies for a full year since these operations were primarily commercial in nature 
additionally  the commercial acquisitions completed during provided million of revenue during ebitda and gross profit 
ebitda increased million  or  to million for as compared to million for these changes were primarily the result of including the other five founding companies for a full year and from our acquisitions 
ebitda as a percentage of revenues was for and for this decrease resulted primarily from an increase in gross profit offset by costs associated with our acquisitions  the integration of the other five founding companies  the development of an operational and functional infrastructure and the higher compensation expense resulting from stock option expense in sg a for and includes amounts related to the robert walters stock option plan which were compensatory prior to the acquisition but which became subject to fixed plan accounting as of the acquisition date 
these compensatory stock option plans resulted in expense of million in and million in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for this increase is primarily attributable to amortization of goodwill associated with our purchase business combinations 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million for compared to million for our operating margin decreased to for compared to for for the reasons described above 
the following operating income discussion at the professional it and commercial segment levels excludes unallocated corporate sg a of million and million for and  respectively 
operating income for the professional it segment increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the majority of this increase relates to the internal expansion throughout the united kingdom and other european locations in permanent placement and contracting revenues  and also benefited from the acquisitions completed during as well as domestic internal growth 
operating margin decreased from in to in primarily as a result of costs related to the robert walters stock option plan as described above 
operating income for the commercial segment increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the same period last year 
inclusion of the other five founding companies for the full year was the main driver of this change 
growth in existing markets  new office openings  strategic alliance programs and the commercial acquisitions completed during also accounted for increased growth 
the operating margin of the commercial segment increased from in to in as we realized the synergies of operating the combined companies and realized savings in controllable costs such as workers compensation 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million for both and interest expense for was primarily related to borrowings on our credit facility to fund the cash portion of several of the acquisitions  while interest expense in related to various borrowings of brewer that were paid off with proceeds from our initial public offering 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for compared to million for as a result of the factors described above 
net income as a percentage of revenues was for and for liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds is from operations  the proceeds of common stock offerings and borrowings under our credit facility 
our principal uses of cash are to fund acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures 
we generally pay our temporary associates and professionals weekly for their services  while receiving payments from customers to days from the date of the invoice 
we have increasing requirements for cash resources to fund working capital increases  new office openings and the expansion of existing offices 
we currently have a million credit facility with a consortium of banks the credit facility which is secured by all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility matures in august interest on any borrowings is computed at our option of either the bank group s prime rate or the london interbank offered rate incrementally adjusted based on our operating leverage ratios 
we pay a quarterly facility fee determined by multiplying the total amount of the credit facility by a percentage which varies based on our operating leverage ratios 
during  we borrowed approximately million on our credit facility  the majority of which was used to pay the cash consideration for several of our acquisitions 
during  we had net borrowings of approximately million on the credit facility  which were used to pay the cash consideration for several of our acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
in  we entered into fixed interest rate swap agreements with respect to a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility to hedge against increases in interest rates which would increase the cost of variable rate borrowings under the credit facility 
as of march   million was outstanding on the credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the net cash provided by operating activities for the periods presented was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities in was primarily attributable to cash paid for acquisitions completed during the year and for additional contingent consideration paid during for acquisitions completed in in  cash used in investing activities was primarily related to consideration paid for our acquisitions 
cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to the acquisitions of the other five founding companies 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in was primarily related to borrowings under our credit facility to finance several of the acquisitions and contingent consideration payments completed during the year 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to the proceeds from a secondary offering of our common stock and borrowings under our credit facility to finance several of our acquisitions 
these proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of borrowings under our credit facility with proceeds from the secondary offering 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering partially offset by the repayment of the debt obligations of the founding companies with proceeds from our initial public offering as well as dividends to stockholders 
our combined cash and cash equivalents increased million in  decreased million in and increased million in as a result of the foregoing factors 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for our existing operations during however  if we continue to make acquisitions or there is a slowdown in the economy or our business  we would need to seek additional financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities  or we will request our bank group to increase the credit facility 
there can be no assurance that we could secure such financing  if and when it is needed  or on terms we deem acceptable 
we periodically reassess the adequacy of our liquidity position  taking into consideration current and anticipated operating cash flow  anticipated capital expenditures  acquisition plans  public or private offerings of debt or equity securities and borrowing availability under the credit facility 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs whether related to it systems or non it systems being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year we have assembled a year compliance team that is working on these compliance matters company wide 
as part of this project and consistent with our operating strategy  we are implementing one primary front office software package caldwell spartin in a majority of our commercial offices 
in a majority of our professional it offices  we are implementing one primary search and retrieval software package ez access and one primary front office software package mas 
in addition  we have selected and implemented the peoplesoft system for our back office  administrative and accounting systems 
all of these software systems have the ability to process transactions with dates for the year and beyond at no incremental cost and  accordingly  we believe that year costs with respect to these software systems are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
as to non it systems and vendor services  other than banking relationships and utilities which includes electrical power  water and related items  we believe there is no single system or vendor service that is material to our operations 
as to banking needs  our banking relationships are primarily with large national and international financial institutions which are undertaking their own year compliance procedures and certifying their compliance to us 
certain of our utility vendors are certifying their year compliance to us 
to the extent that a utility vendor fails to certify its year compliance capability  our contingency plan is to ensure that we have back up utility sources necessary to maintain the critical information systems at our corporate headquarters 
utility failures at our branch offices or the inability of our customers to operate could have a material adverse effect on our revenue sources and could disrupt our customers payment cycle 
we are working with our customers to address the year issues that will affect our business and our plan is to ensure that our year compliance project is materially complete by june  we believe that the costs of our year compliance project for each matter individually and all matters in the aggregate will not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
as to software systems and applications utilized by entities acquired or to be acquired by us  we anticipate that upgrades and or conversions may be required to ensure that these systems and applications are year compliant 
we believe that any such upgrades and or conversions will be timely made and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
seasonality the timing of certain holidays  weather conditions and seasonal vacation patterns can cause the company s results of operations to fluctuate 
we generally expect to realize higher revenues  operating income and net income during the second and third quarters and relatively lower revenues  operating income and net income during the first and fourth quarters 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and cannot be applied retroactively 
we have not yet quantified the impacts of adopting sfas no 
on our financial statements  however  sfas no 
could increase the volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive income once adopted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information regarding certain of our long term debt obligations relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is described in note to the consolidated financial statements
