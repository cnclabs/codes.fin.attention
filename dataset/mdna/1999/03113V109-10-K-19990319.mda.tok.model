management believes that comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december   on a historical basis  and  on a pro forma basis  is appropriate 
this is due primarily to significant changes in depreciation and amortization that result from the application of the purchase method of accounting for the acquisition in and from the increased interest expense due to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition

capital expenditures for the year ended december   the company s capital expenditures were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
bowling centers capital expenditures increased million  which was attributable to the higher number of the company s centers as a result of the company s acquisition program  bowling products capital expenditures decreased million as a result of decreased expenditures on certain new products  expenditures on company wide information systems decreased million and other expenditures increased million 
for the year ended december   the company s capital expenditures were million excluding acquisitions compared with million for the year ended december   on a pro forma basis capital expenditures of the acquired business from january  through december  
the increase was primarily due to an ongoing modernization program  information system expenditures and construction of the chelsea piers center in new york city 
the company conducts an ongoing modernization and maintenance program that results in its centers having upgraded physical plants and generally attractive appearances 
bowling products has relatively modest capital investment requirements  and the company follows a relatively conservative approach to capital investment 
maintenance and replacement investments have been made when clearly needed  but as close to the end of the useful lives of assets as possible 
investment in new product development has received investment priority and has focused on projects with projected payback periods of one to three years 
while the company s intention is to continue its efforts to consolidate the us bowling center industry by purchasing additional bowling centers  the company recently curtailed its pace of acquisitions so that management can focus on improving financial performance of its current centers 
in the near term  however  the company continues to evaluate acquisitions on a more limited scale 
as of february   the company has no formal commitments to build or acquire centers 
the company has committed to build one michael jordan golf center in see business business strategy 
the company funded its capital expenditures from cash generated by operations and  with respect to the construction and acquisition of new centers  internally generated cash  the bank facility  and issuances of common equity

seasonality and market development cycles the us bowling center operations are seasonal 
the following table sets forth amf s us constant centers revenue for the last four quarters quarter ending dollars in millions march  june  september  december  total revenue of total on a consolidated basis  revenue and ebitda of the company s businesses are less seasonal and cyclical 
the geographic diversity of the company s bowling centers  which operate across different regions of the us and across ten other countries  has historically decreased the seasonality of the company s annual cash flows 
although financial performance of bowling centers operations is seasonal in nature in many countries  with cash flows typically peaking in the winter months and reaching their lows in the summer months  the geographic diversity of the company s bowling centers has helped reduce this seasonality as bowling centers in certain countries in which amf operates exhibit different seasonal sales patterns 
in australia  where amf has its largest number of international centers  the reversal of seasons relative to the us helps mitigate the seasonality in worldwide operations 
amf s cash flows are further stabilized by the location of many centers in regions where the climates have high average temperatures and high humidity 
in the us  during the summer months when league bowling is generally less active  bowling centers in the southern us continue to show strong performance 
similarly  in regions with warm summer climates such as hong kong and mexico  where bowling in air conditioned centers may be more attractive than outdoor activities  bowling centers show strong performance 
the increase in us centers attributable to the company s acquisition program  however  has accentuated the seasonality of financial performance of the bowling centers business 
see note business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
modernization and consumer products sales display seasonality 
the us market  which is the largest market for modernization and consumer products  is driven by the beginning of league play in the fall of each year 
while proprietors purchase consumer products throughout the year  they often place larger orders during the summer in preparation for the fall start of leagues 
summer is also often the peak period for modernization equipment 
operators typically sign purchase orders for modernization equipment during the first four months of the year after they receive winter league revenue indications 
equipment is then shipped and installed during the summer when leagues are generally less active 
however  sales of some modernization equipment such as automatic scoring and synthetic lanes are less predictable and fluctuate from year to year because of the longer life cycle of these major products 
the ncp category of bowling products experiences significant fluctuations due to changes in demand for ncps as certain markets experience high growth followed by market maturity  at which time sales to that market decline  sometimes rapidly 
market cycles for individual countries have  in the past  spanned several years  with periods of high demand for several markets eg  south korea and taiwan which  in the company s experience  last five years or more 
current economic difficulties in asia pacific and other regions have resulted in the reduction in shipments and backlog for ncps 
see backlog  recent ncp sales 
international operations the company s international operations are subject to the usual risks inherent in operating abroad  including  but not limited to  risks with respect to currency exchange rates  economic and political destabilization  other disruption of markets  restrictive laws and actions by foreign governments such as restrictions on transfer of funds  import and export duties and quotas  foreign customs and tariffs  value added taxes and unexpected changes in regulatory environments  difficulty in obtaining distribution and support  nationalization  the laws and policies of the united states affecting trade  international investment and loans  and foreign tax laws 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to increase or maintain its international sales or on its results of operations 
amf has a history of operating in a number of international markets  in some cases  for over years 
as in the case of other us based manufacturers with export sales  local currency devaluation increases the cost of the company s bowling equipment in those markets 
as a result  a strengthening us dollar exchange rate may adversely impact sales volume and profit margins during such periods 
economic difficulties in asia pacific and other regions contributed to a reduction in the level of shipments for ncps 
the limited availability of financing for customers to construct new bowling centers also contributed to the reduction of orders 
as of december   the ncp backlog was  which is a reduction of compared to december  as of february   the ncp backlog was  which is a reduction compared to december  and a reduction compared to december  ncp unit sales to china  japan and other asia pacific markets represented for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  ncp unit backlog related to china  japan and other asia pacific markets represented of total ncp unit backlog at february  compared to at december  and at december  foreign currency exchange rates can also affect the translation of operating results from international bowling centers

for the years ended december  and  ebitda of international bowling centers represented and of consolidated results  respectively 
in december  china extended through june the concession allowing foreign investment enterprises to import capital equipment without customs duty or vat 
from july to approximately june  there was sporadic enforcement of the new policy requiring full customs duty and vat 
in addition  the nominal customs duty rate for bowling equipment was cut by approximately in purchasers of bowling equipment used import facilitators throughout this period to import at favorable duty and vat rates 
in approximately july  china significantly strengthened its import restrictions and virtually eliminated the customs duty free and vat free importation of new and used capital goods 
in the second half of  the customs authorities also began stringently enforcing a new policy passed without advance notice in early forbidding the importation of used capital equipment without permits 
permits for the importation of used bowling equipment have proven quite difficult to obtain

year issue year many computer systems in use today were designed and developed using two digits  rather than four  to specify the year 
as a result  such systems will recognize the year as and may assume that the year is rather than this could cause many computer applications to fail completely or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures  and is in the process of preparing for the year the company has evaluated its year risk in three separate categories information technology systems it  non it systems non it and material third party relationships third party risk 
the company has developed a plan in which the risks in each of these categories are being reviewed and addressed by the appropriate level of management as follows it 
the company has a number of financial  retail and operational systems worldwide 
the retail systems in many of its bowling centers are already year compliant 
the company is in the process of installing corrective measures for those bowling centers that are not compliant and expects this effort to be complete by the third quarter of the company is installing new financial and operational systems at several locations 
in connection with this effort  system programs have been designed so that the year will be recognized as a valid date and will not affect the processing of date sensitive information 
the financial and operational systems have already been installed for us bowling centers and at the corporate level 
the effort will be complete for bowling products locations before year end 
several locations have existing systems that are being upgraded for year compliance  which will be completed by the end of the second quarter of for the years ended december  and  the company spent approximately million and million  respectively  on systems that are designed to be year compliant 
the company expects to spend an additional million to complete the installation 
these costs include normal system software and equipment upgrades or replacements which the company anticipated incurring and budgeted in the normal course of business  separate from the year issue 
non it 
non it systems involve embedded technologies  such as microcontrollers or microprocessors 
examples of non it systems include telephones  security systems and computer controlled manufacturing equipment 
the company sells automatic scoring that is computerized and has developed a software program at a cost to the company of approximately  that will address the year issue in its automatic scoring 
this software will be made available to customers with service contracts at no cost and will be sold to customers without service contracts 
to date  management believes the company s non it risks are minimal 
for the most part  costs of addressing non it risks are included in normal upgrade and replacement expenditures which were planned outside of the company s year review 
third party risk 
the company s review of its third party risk includes detailed reviews of critical relationships with vendors and certain business partners 
the company is monitoring and assessing the progress of its vendors and certain business partners to determine whether they will be able to successfully interact with the company in the year the company has contacted and received oral or written responses from at least half of its critical vendors  all of which are in various stages of addressing the year issue  and is currently awaiting response from the remainder of its critical vendors 
if the steps taken by the company and its vendors and certain business partners to be year compliant are not successful  the company could experience various operational difficulties 
these could include  among other things  processing transactions to an incorrect accounting period  difficulties in posting general ledger interfaces and lapse of certain services by vendors to the bowling centers operations 
if the company s plan to install new systems which effectively address the year issue is not successfully or timely implemented  the company may need to devote more resources to the process and additional costs may be incurred 
the company believes that the year issue is being appropriately addressed through the implementation of these new systems and software development and by its critical vendors and certain business partners and does not expect the year issue to have a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company in future periods 
however  should the remaining review of the company s year risks reveal potentially non compliant computer systems or material third parties  contingency plans will be developed at that time
