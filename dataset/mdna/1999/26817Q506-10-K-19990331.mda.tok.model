item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a financial services company that originates primarily mortgage loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties and loans secured by manufactured homes 
the company will generally securitize the loans funded as collateral for collateralized bonds  thereby limiting its credit and liquidity risk and providing long term financing for its investment portfolio 
financial condition december  amounts in thousands except per share data investments collateral for collateralized bonds   securities   other investments   loans held for securitization   non recourse debt   recourse debt   shareholders equity   book value per common share collateral for collateralized bond collateral for collateralized bonds consists primarily of securities backed by adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage loans secured by first liens on single family properties  fixed rate loans secured by first liens on multifamily and commercial properties  manufactured housing installment loans secured by either a ucc filing or a motor vehicle title and property tax receivables 
as of december   dynex reit had series of collateralized bonds outstanding 
the collateral for collateralized bonds decreased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  this decrease of billion is principally the combined result of billion in paydowns on collateral and billion decrease in unrealized gain on investments available for sale 
this decrease was primarily offset by the addition of billion of collateral related to the issuance of two series of collateralized bonds in securities securities consist primarily of fixed rate funding notes secured by automobile installment contracts and adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
securities also include derivative and residual securities 
derivative securities are classes of collateralized bonds  mortgage pass through certificates or mortgage certificates that pay to the holder substantially all interest ie  an interest only security  or substantially all principal ie  a principal only security 
residual interests represent the right to receive the excess of i the cash flow from the collateral pledged to secure related mortgage backed securities  together with any reinvestment income thereon  over ii the amount required for principal and interest payments on the mortgage backed securities or repurchase arrangements  together with any related administrative expenses 
securities decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of dynex reit pledging million of securities as part of the billion collateral for collateralized bonds issued during the second quarter of in addition  dynex reit sold million of securities and received million in paydowns during these decreases were partially offset by new securities acquired during of billion resulting from dynex reit s exercise of its call rights on million of securities and purchasing million of securities in the open market during the same period 
other investments other investments consist primarily of corporate bonds  a note receivable received in connection with the sale of the company s single family mortgage operations in may and property tax receivables 
other investments decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease of million is primarily the result of the securitization of million of property tax receivables as collateral for collateralized bonds during and the receipt of million in principal payments on the note receivable from the sale of the single family mortgage operations 
these decreases were partially offset by the purchase million of corporate bonds and million of property tax receivables during loans held for securitization loans held for securitization increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase was due to new loan fundings from the company s production operations totaling billion and bulk purchases of single family loans totaling million during these increases were partially offset by the securitization of billion of loans held for securitization as collateral for collateralized bonds issued during non recourse debt collateralized bonds issued by dynex reit are recourse only to the assets pledged as collateral  and are otherwise non recourse to dynex reit 
collateralized bonds increased to billion at december  from billion at december  primarily as a result of the issuance of billion of collateralized bonds during the  of which million was retained and financed through repurchase agreements 
these increases were partially offset by billion of paydowns 
recourse debt recourse debt decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  this decrease was primarily due to the million reduction in repurchase agreements due to the securitization during of million of securities  which were previously financed by repurchase agreements  as collateral for collateralized bonds 
also  dynex reit sold million of previously retained collateralized bonds which had been financed by million of repurchase agreements 
in addition  dynex reit pledged million of commercial loans as collateral for collateralized bonds during which were previously financed by million of notes payable 
these decreases were offset by the addition of million of notes payable as a result of additional loan fundings 
shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of a million reduction in the net unrealized gain on investments available for sale from a positive million at december  to a negative million at december  during  the dividends declared by the dynex reit exceeded its earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles by million  resulting in a decline in shareholders equity of such amount 
also  dynex reit repurchased  of its common shares at an aggregate purchase price of million during these decreases were partially offset by million of common stock proceeds received through the dividend reinvestment plan during the same period

the decrease in net income per common share during as compared to is the combined result of the decrease in net income and an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding due to the issuance of new common stock and the partial conversion of outstanding preferred stock 
net interest margin for the year ended december  decreased to million  or  over net interest margin of million for the same period in this decrease in net interest margin was primarily the result of a million increase in premium amortization expense during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in premium amortization resulted from a higher rate of prepayments in the investment portfolio during the year ended december  than during the same period in in addition  the net interest spread on the investment portfolio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the decrease in the net interest spread is also primarily the result of higher premium amortization as a result of the increase in principal prepayments as well as the decrease in spreads between the indices on which the interest earning assets primarily six month libor and the one year constant maturity treasury and interest bearing liabilities primarily one month libor are based 
the company recorded charges to earnings totaling million in regard to autobond related assets 
this charge included an impairment charge on the funding notes of million 
it also included a million charge to the company s investment in autobond common and preferred stock to its quoted market value at december  the company also fully reserved for the million senior convertible note it acquired from autobond 
the loss gain on sale of investments and trading activities for decreased to a million loss  as compared to a million gain for this decrease is primarily the result of net losses recognized of million on trading positions entered into during the twelve months ended december  the gain on sale of assets during is primarily the result of premiums received of million on covered call options and put options written during and gains generated of million on the sale of certain investments 
net administrative fees and expenses to dhi increased million  or  to million in this increase is primarily a result of the continued growth in the company s production operations  primarily in the manufactured housing and commercial lending business 
compared to the increase in net income during as compared to is primarily the result of an increase in both net interest margin and gain on sale of investments and trading activities 
these increases were offset partially by an increase in both general and administrative expenses and net administrative expenses and fees to dhi and no comparable gain to the gain on sale of the single family mortgage operations in the decrease in net income per common share during as compared to is primarily the result of an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding due to the issuance of new common stock and the partial conversion of outstanding preferred stock during net interest margin for the year ended december  increased to million  or  over net interest margin of million for the same period in this increase in net interest margin was a result of an overall growth in average interest earning assets which increased to billion during as compared to billion for additionally  the increase in net interest margin was due to the additional common stock issued during  the proceeds from which was initially used to pay short term borrowings 
the gain on the sale of the single family mortgage operations in was a one time gain related to the sale of the company s single family correspondent  wholesale and servicing business on may  the loss gain on sale of investments and trading activities for increased to a million gain  as compared to a million loss for this increase is primarily the result of premiums received of million on covered call options and put options written during and gains generated of million on the sale of certain investments 
during  dynex reit sold certain investments in its portfolio which resulted in a million net gain 
dynex reit also wrote down  by million  the carrying value of certain mortgage derivative securities as anticipated future prepayment rates were expected to result in less cash receipts than the remaining basis in those investments 
net administrative fees and expenses to dhi increased million  or  to million in this increase is primarily a result of the growth in the company s production operations offset partially by the expense reductions resulting from the sale of the single family mortgage operations in may in  the company opened one regional office and three district offices to support its manufactured housing lending operations the following table summarizes the average balances of interest earning assets and their average effective yields  along with the average interest bearing liabilities and the related average effective interest rates  for each of the periods presented

compared to the net interest spread decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in this decrease was due to the reduction in interest earning asset yields from increased premium amortization expense and the addition of lower yielding assets to the investment portfolio 
the overall yield on interest earning assets decreased to for year ended december   from for the same period in while the cost of interest bearing liabilities remained relatively flat for the year ended december  compared to the same period in individually  the net interest spread on collateralized bonds increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the same period in this slight increase was primarily due to the securitization of collateral which has a lower premium as a percentage of principal  during the second quarter of in addition  one month libor decreased basis points during the fourth quarter of which increased the net interest spread on collateralized bonds since the arm loans underlying the collateralized bonds take on average three to six months to adjust to lower interest rates 
the net interest spread on securities decreased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the sale of certain higher coupon collateral during the third quarter of along with the purchase of lower coupon fixed rate mortgage securities during the first quarter of in addition  certain assets were placed on non accrual status during the net interest spread on other investments increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december   to basis points for the year ended december   due primarily to lower borrowing costs associated with the company s single family model home purchase and leaseback business during the net interest spread on loans held for securitization increased basis points  from basis points from the year ended december   to basis points for the same period in this increase is primarily attributable to lower borrowing costs as a result of higher level of compensating cash balances during the year ended december  compared to the same period in credits earned from these compensating cash balances are used by the company to offset interest expense 
compared to the net interest spread decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in this decrease was primarily the result of the decline in the spread on the collateralized bonds  which for constituted the largest portion of the investment portfolio on a weighted average basis 
in addition  short term interest rates increased during march  which raised the company s weighted average borrowing costs to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the overall yield on interest earning assets increased to for year ended december   from for the same period in this increase is primarily due to the arm assets in the portfolio resetting upwards during and the purchase of higher yielding arm residual trusts during the latter part of and during the first three quarters of individually  the net interest spread on collateralized bonds decreased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the same period in this decline was primarily due to the securitization of lower coupon collateral  principally a quality single family arm loans during coupled with the prepayments of seasoned  higher coupon single family collateral during in addition  the spread on the net investment in collateralized bonds decreased due to higher premium amortization caused by increased prepayments during the latter part of the net interest spread on securities increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributed to the arm securities in the portfolio during having a higher margin than those arm securities in the portfolio in in addition  dynex reit purchased higher yielding arm residual trusts during the latter part of and during the first three quarters of the net interest spread on other investments increased basis points  from a negative basis points for the year ended december   to a positive basis points for the year ended december   due primarily to lower borrowing costs associated with the company s single family model home purchase and leaseback business during the net interest spread on loans held for securitization decreased basis points  from basis points from the year ended december   to basis points for the same period in this decrease is primarily attributable to the purchase of lower coupon loans  principally a quality single family arm loans during the following tables summarize the amount of change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in interest rates versus changes in volume to to rate volume total rate volume total collateral for collateralized bonds       securities       other investments     loans held for securitization      total interest income       non recourse debt      recourse debt collateralized bonds     retained total collateralized bonds      recourse debt secured by investments securities       other investments     loans held for securitization     recourse debt unsecured     total interest expense       net margin on portfolio       note the change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in both volume and rate  which cannot be segregated  has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

interest income and interest earning assets average interest earning assets grew to billion during  an increase of from billion of average interest earning assets during this increase in average interest earnings assets was primarily the result of loan originations of billion and loan purchases of million for the year ended december  in addition  dynex reit purchased million of securities and million of other investments during the year ended december  dynex reit also exercised call rights on million of securities during the same period 
these increases were partially offset by billion of paydowns on investments and million of securities sold during the year ended december  average interest earning assets increased to billion during  from billion during this increase in average interest earning assets was primarily the result of the addition of billion of collateral for collateralized bonds during of this amount  billion resulted from the pledge of arm securities already owned by dynex reit as collateral for collateralized bonds 
this was offset by billion of principal paydowns on investments during total interest income rose during  from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period of this increase in total interest income was due to the growth in average interest earning assets during total interest income also rose during from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in  due to the increase in average interest earning assets 
overall  the yield on average interest earning assets fell to for the year ended december   from and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these decreases resulted from increased premium amortization expense due to an increase in principal prepayments on investments and an overall decrease in interest rates during premium amortization expense reduced the average interest earning assets yield for the year ended december  versus and for the year ended december  and  respectively

approximately billion of the investment portfolio as of december  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates

the average asset yield is reduced for the amortization of premiums  net of discounts on the investment portfolio 
by creating its investments through its production operations  the company believes that premium amounts are less than if the investments were acquired in the market 
as indicated in the table below  premiums on the collateral for collateralized bonds  arm securities and fixed rate securities at december  were million  or approximately of the aggregate balance of collateral for collateralized bonds  arm securities and fixed rate securities 
of this million  million relates to the premium on multifamily and commercial mortgage loans that have prepayment lockouts or yield maintenance for at least seven years 
amortization expense as a percentage of principal paydowns has declined to for the year ended december  from and for the same periods in and as the investment portfolio mix changed to assets funded primarily at par or at a discount 
the principal repayment rate indicated in the table below as cpr annualized rate was for the year ended december  cpr or constant prepayment rate is a measure of the annual prepayment rate on a pool of loans

funds to finance the investment portfolio are borrowed primarily in the form of non recourse collateralized bonds or repurchase agreements 
the interest rates paid on collateralized bonds are either fixed or floating rates  the interest rates on the repurchase agreements are floating rates 
dynex reit may use interest rate swaps  caps and financial futures to manage its interest rate risk 
the net cost of these instruments is included in the cost of funds table below as a component of interest expense for the period to which they relates 
average borrowed funds increased from billion during to billion during the increase resulted primarily from the issuance of billion of collateralized bonds during and the addition of million of notes payable as a result of additional assets 
this increase was partially offset by paydowns on the collateralized bonds of billion 
for the year ended december   interest expense also increased to million from million for the year ended  while the average cost of funds decreased to for compared to for the decrease in the cost of funds was a result of a decrease in the one month libor rates during the fourth quarter of the cost of funds for the year ended december   compared to december   increased to from  respectively as a result of the increase of the one month libor rate during the first quarter of cost of funds in millions average borrowed interest expense cost of funds funds excludes non interest collateralized bond related expenses

interest rate agreements as part of the asset liability management process for its investment portfolio  dynex reit may enter into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps  swaps and financial futures contracts 
these agreements are used to reduce interest rate risk which arises from the lifetime yield caps on the arm securities  the mismatched repricing of portfolio investments versus borrowed funds  the funding of fixed interest rates on certain portfolio investments with floating rate borrowings and finally  assets repricing on indices such as the prime rate which differ from the related borrowing indices 
the agreements are designed to protect the portfolio s cash flow and to provide income and capital appreciation to dynex reit in the event that short term interest rates rise quickly 
the following table includes all interest rate agreements in effect as of each year end for asset liability management of the investment portfolio 
this table excludes all interest rate agreements in effect for the loan production operations as generally these agreements are used to hedge interest rate risk relating to forward commitments to fund loans 
generally  interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the interest rate risk associated with assets that have periodic and annual interest rate reset limitations financed with borrowings that have no such limitations 
amounts presented are aggregate notional amounts 
to the extent any of these agreements are terminated  gains and losses are generally amortized over the remaining period of the original agreement

net interest rate agreement expense the net interest rate agreement expense  or hedging expense  equals the cost of the agreements presented in the previous table  net of any benefits received from these agreements 
for the year ended december   net hedging expense amounted to million versus million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
such amounts exclude the hedging costs and benefits associated with the company s production activities as these amounts are deferred as additional premium or discount on the loans funded and amortized over the life of the loans as an adjustment to their yield 
the net interest rate agreement expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to the company entering into billion of new interest rate agreements during due to a decline in treasury yields during the fourth quarter of  the company terminated billion of interest rate agreements for a total loss of million 
this loss is being amortized into income or expense of the corresponding hedged instrument over the remaining period of the original hedge or hedged instrument as a yield adjustment

this decrease in the portfolio s value is primarily attributable to the accelerated prepayment activity on in the investment portfolio during and the securitization of million of commercial loans during the fourth quarter of credit exposures the following table summarizes single family mortgage loan  manufactured housing loan and commercial mortgage loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding collateral balance for those securities in which dynex reit has retained a portion of the direct credit risk 
the decrease in delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding collateral balance from at december  to at december  is primarily related to the fact that the single family loans related to the company s single family operations that were sold in are a smaller portion of such securities  and that the aggregate delinquency rate on the other single family loans  the manufactured housing loans and the commercial mortgage loans are 
the company monitors and evaluates its exposure to credit losses and has established reserves based upon anticipated losses  general economic conditions and trends in the investment portfolio

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas no 

fas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction

 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise fas no 

fas no 
requires that after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale that meets all of the criteria of fas no

to have a material impact on the financial statements as the company typically accounts for securitization of assets as secured financing transactions 
year the company is dependent upon purchased  leased  and internally developed software to conduct certain operations 
in addition  the company relies upon certain counterparties such as banks and loan servicers who are also highly dependent upon computer systems 
the company recognizes that some computer software may incorrectly recognize dates beyond december  the ability of the company and its counterparties to correctly operate computer software in the year is critical to the company  s operations 
the company uses several major and minor computer systems to conduct its business operations 
the computer systems deemed most important to the company s ability to continue operations are as follows the internally developed loan origination system for manufactured housing operations the internally developed loan origination and asset management system for commercial loans the internally developed investment portfolio analytics  securitization  and securities administration software the purchased servicing system for commercial loans the purchased servicing system for single family and manufactured housing loans the purchased general ledger accounting system in addition  the company is involved in data interchange with a number of counterparties in the normal course of business 
each system or interface that the company relies on is being tested and evaluated for year compliance 
the company has contacted all of its key software vendors to determine their year readiness 
the company has received documentation from each of the vendors providing assurances of year compliance baan coda  vendor of the general ledger accounting system  has provided confirmation that their current software release is fully year compliant 
the company plans to apply this release in the first half of synergy software  vendor of the commercial loan servicing system  has provided confirmation that the current release of their software is fully year compliant 
the company has installed and performed initial testing on this version with no issues discovered 
interlinq software  vendor of the single family and manufactured housing loan servicing software  has provided assurance that their software is year compliant 
all software developed internally by the company was designed to be year compliant 
nevertheless  the company has established a year test bed to ensure that there were no design or development oversights that could lead to a year problem 
initial testing of all key applications was completed in january of  with only minor issues discovered and subsequently remedied 
continued testing of certain applications will continue through june of the company has reviewed or is reviewing the year progress of its primary financial counterparties 
based on initial reviews  these counterparties are expected to be in compliance 
the company  as master servicer of certain securities  is in the process of assessing the year readiness of its external servicers  to ensure that these parties will be able to correctly remit loan information and payments after december  the company believes that  other than its exposure to financial counterparties  its most significant risk with respect to internal or purchased software is the software systems used to service manufactured housing loans 
the company will not be able to service these loans without the automated system 
should these loans go unattended for a period greater than three months  the result could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company is also at significant risk if the systems of the financial institutions that provide the company financing and software for cash management services should fail 
in a worst case scenario  the company would be unable to fund its operations or pay on its obligations for an unknown period of failure 
this would have material adverse impact on the company 
the company is also at significant risk if the voice and data communications network supplied by its provider should fail 
in such an instance the company would be unable to originate or efficiently service its manufactured housing loans until the problem is remedied 
the company is closely monitoring the year efforts of its telecommunications provider and is developing contingency plans in the event that the provider does not give sufficient assurance of compliance by june  the company is also at significant risk should the electric utility company for the company s offices in glen allen  virginia  fail to provide power for several business days 
in such an instance  the company would be unable i to communicate over its telecommunication systems  ii would be unable to process data  and iii would be unable to originate or service loans until the problem is remedied 
dynex continues to monitor the year status of its utility provider  whose plan is scheduled to be completed in the fall of the company uses many other systems including systems that are not information technology oriented  both purchased and developed internally  that could fail to perform accurately after december  management believes that the functions performed by these systems are either non critical or could be performed manually in the event of failure 
the company will complete its year test plan and remediation efforts in the second quarter of management believes that there is little possibility of a significant disruption in business 
the major risks are those related to the ability of vendors and business partners to complete year plans 
the company expects that those vendors and counterparties will complete their year compliance programs before january  the company has incurred less than  in costs to date in carrying out its year compliance program 
the company estimates that it will spend less than  to complete the plan 
costs could increase in the event that the company determines that a counterparty will not be year compliant 
the company is still developing contingency plans in the event that a system or counterparty is not year compliant 
these plans will be developed prior to june  liquidity and capital resources the company finances its operations from a variety of sources 
these sources include cash flow generated from the investment portfolio  including net interest income and principal payments and prepayments  common stock offerings through the dividend reinvestment plan  short term warehouse lines of credit with commercial and investment banks  repurchase agreements and the capital markets via the asset backed securities market which provides long term non recourse funding of the investment portfolio via the issuance of collateralized bonds 
historically  cash flow generated from the investment portfolio has satisfied its working capital needs  and the company has had sufficient access to capital to fund its loan production operations  on both a short term prior to securitization and long term after securitization basis 
however  if a significant decline in the market value of the investment portfolio that is funded with recourse debt should occur  the available liquidity from these other borrowings may be reduced 
as a result of such a reduction in liquidity  the company may be forced to sell certain investments in order to maintain liquidity 
if required  these sales could be made at prices lower than the carrying value of such assets  which could result in losses 
in order to grow its equity base  dynex reit may issue additional capital stock 
management strives to issue such additional shares when it believes existing shareholders are likely to benefit from such offerings through higher earnings and dividends per share than as compared to the level of earnings and dividends dynex reit would likely generate without such offerings 
during  dynex reit issued  shares of its common stock during pursuant to its dividend reinvestment program for net proceeds of million 
certain aspects of dynex reit s funding strategies subject it to liquidity risk 
liquidity risk stems from dynex reit s use of repurchase agreements  its use of committed lines of credit with mark to market provisions and the reliance on the asset backed securitization markets for its long term funding needs 
liquidity risk also stems from hedge positions the company may take to hedge its commercial and manufactured housing loan production 
repurchase agreements are generally provided by investment banks  and subject dynex reit to margin call risk if the market value of assets pledged as collateral for the repurchase agreements declines 
dynex reit has established target equity requirements for each type of investment pledged as collateral  taking into account the price volatility and liquidity of each such investment 
dynex reit strives to maintain enough liquidity to meet anticipated margin calls if short term interest rates increased basis points in a twelve month period 
due to dislocations in the fixed income markets in the third and fourth quarters of  dynex reit experienced declines in the market value of collateral pledged to repurchase agreements and its loan hedge positions and experienced margin calls  even though interest rates were generally decreasing 
dynex reit was able to meet these margin calls from its available liquidity  but sold assets in october and november in order to increase its liquidity 
the total book value for all the assets sold during the fourth quarter of was million and resulted in losses totaling million 
dynex reit has committed lines of credit and uncommitted repurchase facilities to finance the accumulation of assets for securitization 
dynex reit borrows on these lines of credit on a short term basis to support the accumulation of assets prior to the issuance of collateralized bonds 
these borrowings may bear fixed or variable interest rates  may require additional collateral in the event that the value of the existing collateral declines  and may be due on demand or upon the occurrence of certain events 
if borrowing costs are higher than the yields on the assets financed with such funds  dynex reit s ability to acquire or fund additional assets may be substantially reduced and it may experience losses 
dynex reit currently has a total of million of committed lines of credit and million of uncommitted repurchase facilities to finance loans held for securitization and other investments 
these borrowings are paid down as dynex reit securitizes or sells assets 
generally these borrowings allow for the warehousing of assets for a period of days 
dynex reit generally intends to securitize assets by product type every days 
if there exists a dislocation or disruption in the asset backed market  dynex reit may be unable to securitize the assets  or may only be able to securitize the assets on unfavorable terms 
in such a case  dynex reit would be required to repay the lines of credit with either available liquidity or would be required to liquidate the assets or other assets to generate liquidity 
in addition  lines of credit with commercial and investment banks may include provisions by such banks to mark the collateral to market on a daily basis 
to the extent the market value of the associated asset has declined due to market conditions  dynex reit may be required to provide additional collateral or sell the associated asset which may result in losses 
as a part of its strategy to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates on commercial mortgage loans funded and commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans  dynex reit may enter into forward sales of treasury futures 
such sales are executed through third parties  which require cash collateral in the event that movements in interest rates adversely impact the value of the futures position 
the value of the related loans or loan commitments will generally increase in value as the futures position decreases  however  such value is generally not recognized until the loans are securitized 
in order to maintain its hedge positions  dynex reit may therefore be exposed to additional cash collateral requirements in adverse interest rate environments 
a substantial portion of the assets are pledged to secure indebtedness incurred by dynex reit 
accordingly  those assets would not be available for distribution to any general creditors or the stockholders of dynex reit in the event of the liquidation  except to the extent that the value of such assets exceeds the amount of the indebtedness they secure 
non recourse debt dynex reit  through limited purpose finance subsidiaries  has issued non recourse debt in the form of collateralized bonds to fund the majority of its investment portfolio 
the obligations under the collateralized bonds are payable solely from the collateral for collateralized bonds and are otherwise non recourse to dynex reit 
collateral for collateralized bonds are not subject to margin calls 
the maturity of each class of collateralized bonds is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral 
each series is also subject to redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures  generally when the remaining balance of the bonds equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds 
at december   dynex reit had billion of collateralized bonds outstanding as compared to billion at december  recourse debt secured 
at december   dynex reit had four committed credit facilities aggregating million  comprised of i a million credit line  expiring in april  from a consortium of commercial banks primarily for the warehousing of multifamily construction and permanent loans including providing the letters of credit for tax exempt bonds and manufactured housing loans  ii a million credit line  expiring in november  from an investment bank primarily for the warehousing of permanent loans on multifamily and commercial properties  iii a million credit line  expiring in april  from a consortium of commercial banks and finance companies to fund the purchase of model homes  and iv a million credit line  expiring in september  from an investment bank for the warehousing of the funding notes 
dynex reit expects these credit facilities will be renewed or replaced  if necessary  at their respective expiration dates  although there can be no assurance of such renewal or replacement 
the lines of credit contain certain financial covenants which dynex reit met as of december  however  changes in asset levels or results of operations could result in the violation of one or more covenants in the future 
at december   dynex reit had million outstanding under its committed credit facilities 
dynex reit also uses repurchase agreements to finance a portion of its investments  which generally have thirty day maturities 
repurchase agreements allow dynex reit to sell investments for cash together with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same investments on a specified date for a price which is equal to the original sales price plus an interest component 
dynex reit has two uncommitted master repurchase facilities aggregating million for the accumulation of assets for securitization 
these agreements expire in dynex reit expects these repurchase facilities will be renewed  if necessary  at their expiration dates  although there can be no assurance of such renewal 
at december   outstanding obligations under all repurchase agreements totaled million compared to million at december  the following table summarizes the outstanding balances of repurchase agreements by credit rating of the related assets pledged as collateral to support such repurchase agreements as of december  the table excludes repurchase agreements used to finance loans held for securitization  which totaled million at december  repurchase agreements by rating of investments financed in millions december  aaa aa a bbb below bbb total increases in short term interest rates  long term interest rates or market risk could negatively impact the valuation of securities and may limit dynex reit s borrowing ability or cause various lenders to initiate margin calls for securities financed using repurchase agreements 
additionally  certain investments are classes of securities rated aa  a or bbb that are subordinated to other classes from the same series of securities 
such subordinated classes may have less liquidity than securities that are not subordinated and the value of such classes is more dependent on the credit rating of the related insurer or the credit performance of the underlying loans 
in instances of a downgrade of an insurer or the deterioration of the credit quality of the underlying collateral  dynex reit may be required to sell certain investments in order to maintain liquidity 
if required  these sales could be made at prices lower than the carrying value of the assets  which could result in losses 
to reduce exposure to changes in short term interest rates on its repurchase agreements  dynex reit may lengthen the duration of its repurchase agreements secured by investments by entering into certain interest rate futures and or option contracts 
as of december   no such financial futures or option contracts were outstanding 
unsecured 
since  dynex reit has issued three series of unsecured notes payable totaling million 
the proceeds from these issuances have been used to reduce short term debt related to financing loans held for securitization during the accumulation period as well as for general corporate purposes 
these notes payable have an outstanding balance at december  of million 
the above note agreements contain certain financial covenants which dynex reit met as of december  however  changes in asset levels or results of operations could result in the violation of one or more covenants in the future 
total recourse debt decreased from billion for december  to billion for december  this decrease is primarily due to the million reduction in repurchase agreements due to the securitization of million securities as collateral for collateralized bonds during which were previously financed by repurchase agreements 
also  dynex reit sold million of retained collateralized bonds  which were previously financed by million of repurchase agreements 
in addition  dynex reit pledged million of commercial loans as collateral for collateralized bonds during which were previously financed by million of notes payable 
these decreases were offset by the addition of million of notes payable as a result of the purchase or origination of additional assets

these results were a decrease from the fourth quarter of net income of million and earnings per common share of 
the decrease in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in is primarily due to a decrease in net interest margin  a loss in the sale of investments and trading activities and an impairment charge related to certain assets of the company 
net interest margin for the fourth quarter of totaled million compared with million for the fourth quarter of the decrease in the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was primarily due an increase in the average interest bearing liabilities the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in and no corresponding increase in average interest bearing assets 
the average interest earning assets were billion for both the fourth quarter of and however  the average asset yield for the quarter ended december  decreased to compared to for the fourth quarter of the decrease in the yield during the fourth quarter was primarily due to the prepayment of higher yielding assets during being replaced with lower yielding assets 
additionally  the average interest bearing liabilities increased billion to billion for the fourth quarter of compared to billion for the fourth quarter of the average cost of funds decreased from for the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of the decrease in the average cost of funds was due primarily to a decrease in the average one month libor for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of for the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a million net loss on the sale of investments and trading activities compared to a gain of million in the fourth quarter of the loss in the fourth quarter of was primarily due to million of net losses on million of securities sold during the fourth quarter of  while the gain of million in the fourth quarter of was the primarily the result of million of net gains on trading position entered into during production from all sources for the fourth quarter of decreased to million from million for the fourth quarter of primarily due to a purchase in the fourth quarter of of million of a quality single family loans 
this was offset by an increase in both commercial and manufactured home loan fundings during the fourth quarter of as well as the purchase of million of funding notes secured by automobile installment contracts 
in june  the company entered into a series of agreements with autobond relating to the purchase on a flow basis of funding notes secured by automobile contracts 
in january  the company  in conjunction with third party specialists experienced in subprime auto lending  performed certain compliance procedures in regard to autobond s compliance with the underwriting criteria as set forth under the agreements 
the results from the underwriting compliance tests indicated that a significant number of loans contained material deviations from the underwriting criteria 
the specialists also performed various tests and procedures related to autobond s compliance with the agreed upon servicing procedures and guidelines 
the results of those tests highlighted certain irregularities which resulted in the company s determination that the delinquency ratio previously reported by autobond was understated 
based on the findings from the compliance testing and subsequent analysis performed by the company as a result of these findings  the company has determined that the automobile contracts which secure the company s funding notes are of a lower credit quality than previously represented to the company 
as such  the company recorded a charge to earnings as of december  totaling million 
this charge included an impairment charge on the funding notes of million 
it also included a million charge to the company s investment in autobond common and preferred stock to its quoted market value at december  the company also fully reserved for the million unsecured senior convertible note it acquired from autobond 
in march  dynex issued approximately billion of collateralized bonds secured by single family loans  arm securities and manufactured housing loans

forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k made by the company  that are not historical fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
the company does not undertake  and the securities litigation reform act specifically relieves the company from  any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following economic conditions 
the company is affected by consumer demand for manufactured housing  multifamily housing and other products which it finances 
a material decline in demand for these products and services would result in a reduction in the volume of loans originated by the company 
the risk of defaults and credit losses could increase during an economic slowdown or recession 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s financial performance and the performance on the company s securitized loan pools 
capital resources 
the company relies on various credit facilities and repurchase agreements with certain commercial and investment banking firms to help meet the company s short term funding needs 
the company believes that as these agreements expire  they will continue to be available or will be able to be replaced  however no assurance can be given as to such availability or the prospective terms and conditions of such agreements or replacements 
capital markets 
the company relies on the capital markets for the sale upon securitization of its collateralized bonds or other types of securities 
while the company has historically been able to sell such collateralized bonds and securities into the capital markets  there can be no assurances that circumstances relating either to the company or the capital markets may limit or preclude the ability of the company to sell such collateralized bonds or securities in the future 
interest rate fluctuations 
the company s income depends on its ability to earn greater interest on its investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by the company generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
a majority of the loans currently originated by the company are fixed rate 
the profitability of a particular securitization may be reduced if interest rates increase substantially before these loans are securitized 
in addition  the majority of the investments held by the company are variable rate collateral for collateralized bonds and adjustable rate investments 
these investments are financed through non recourse long term collateralized bonds and recourse short term repurchase agreements 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have periodic interest rate caps and the related borrowing have no such interest rate caps 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans retained by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from estimates made by the company at the time of securitization 
the allowance for losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual defaults may differ from the company s estimate as a result of economic conditions 
actual defaults on arm loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
the company believes that its reserves are adequate for such risks 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
the company s exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yield securities 
at december   the yield curve was considered flat relative to its normal shape  and as a result  the company expects a continuation of relatively high prepayment rates during the first six months in competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market 
increased competition in the market could adversely affect the company s market share within the industry and hamper the company s efforts to expand its production sources 
regulatory changes 
the company s business is subject to federal and state regulation which  among other things require the company to maintain various licenses and qualifications and require specific disclosures to borrowers 
changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect the company s operation and the performance of the company s securitized loan pools 
new production sources 
the company has expanded both its manufactured housing and commercial lending businesses 
the company is incurring or will incur expenditures related to the start up of these businesses  with no guarantee that production targets set by the company will be met or that these businesses will be profitable 
various factors such as economic conditions  interest rates  competition and the lack of the company s prior experience in these businesses could all impact these new production sources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a financial services company  net interest income comprises the primary component of the company s earnings 
as a result  the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or reprice within specified periods 
the company s strategy is to mitigate interest rate risk through the creation of a diversified investment portfolio of high quality assets that  in the aggregate  preserves the company s capital base while generating stable income in a variety of interest rate and prepayment environments 
in many instances  the investment strategy involves not only the creation of the asset  but also structuring the related securitization or borrowing to create a stable yield profile and reduce interest rate risk 
the company continuously monitors the aggregate cash flow  projected net yield and market value of its investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
generally  the company adds investments to its portfolio that are designed to increase the diversification and reduce the variability of the yield produced by the portfolio in different interest rate environments 
the company s portfolio executive committee pec  which includes executive management representatives  monitors and manages the interest rate sensitivity and repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of change in both the net portfolio value and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a monthly basis by the pec and quarterly by the board of directors 
the company utilizes several tools and risk management strategies to monitor and address interest rate risk  including i a quarterly sensitivity analysis using option adjusted spread oas methodology to calculate the expected change in net interest margin as well as the change in the market value of various assets within the portfolio under various extreme scenarios  and ii a monthly static cash flow and yield projection under different scenarios 
such tools allow the company to continually monitor and evaluate its exposure to these risks and to manage the risk profile of the investment portfolio in response to changes in the market risk 
while the company may use such tools  there can be no assurance the company will accomplish the goal of adequately managing the risk profile of the investment portfolio 
the company measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
the company estimates its interest income for the next twelve months assuming no changes in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income 
the following table summarizes the company s net interest margin sensitivity analysis as of december  this analysis represents management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin given a parallel shift in interest rates 
the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  the analysis is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ from the modeled results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide a degree of optionality 
the model considers the effects of these embedded options when projecting cash flows and earnings 
the most significant option affecting the company s portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model uses a dynamic prepayment model that applies a constant prepayment rate ranging from to based on the projected incentive to refinance for each loan type in any given period 
while the company s model considers these factors  the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  its projected results assume no additions or subtractions to the company s portfolio  and no change to the company s liability structure 
historically  the company has made significant changes to its assets and liabilities  and is likely to do so in the future 
basis point change in net increase decrease interest margin from in interest rates base case base the company s investment policy sets forth guidelines for assuming interest rate risk 
the investment policy stipulates that given a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates over a twelve month period  the estimated net interest margin may not change by more than of current net interest margin during the subsequent one year period 
based on the projections above  the company is in compliance with its stated policy regarding the interest rate sensitivity of net interest margin 
approximately billion of the company s investment portfolio as of december  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately and of the arm loans underlying the company s arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor and one year cmt  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  the company s net interest spread earned on its investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i the lag in resets of the arm loans underlying the arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings and ii rate resets on the arm loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as short term interest rates stabilize and the arm loans reset  the net interest margin may be restored to its former level as the yields on the arm loans adjust to market conditions 
conversely  net interest margin may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the arm loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
in each case  however  the company expects that the increase or decrease in the net interest spread due to changes in the short term interest rates to be temporary 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements 
because of the or periodic cap nature of the arm loans underlying the arm securities  these securities may decline in market value in a rising interest rate environment 
in a rapidly increasing rate environment  as was experienced in  a decline in value may be significant enough to impact the amount of funds available under repurchase agreements to borrow against these securities 
in order to maintain liquidity  the company may be required to sell certain securities 
to mitigate this potential liquidity risk  the company strives to maintain excess liquidity to cover any additional margin required in a rapidly increasing interest rate environment  defined as a increase in short term interest rates over a twelve month time period 
liquidity risk also exists with all other investments pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements  but to a lesser extent 
as part of its asset liability management process  the company enters into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps and swaps and financial futures contracts hedges 
these interest rate agreements are used by the company to help mitigate the risk to the investment portfolio of fluctuations in interest rates that would ultimately impact net interest income 
to help protect the company s net interest income in a rising interest rate environment  the company has purchased interest rate caps with a notional amount of billion  which help reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk rising above the lifetime interest rate caps on arm securities and loans 
these interest rate caps provide the company with additional cash flow should the related index increase above the contracted rates 
the contracted rates on these interest rate caps are based on one month libor  six month libor or one year cmt 
the company will also utilize interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in financing rates of assets and to convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rate where the associated asset financed is fixed rate 
interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that the company uses to manage certain interest rate risks represent protection for the earnings and cash flow of the investment portfolio in adverse markets 
to date  short term interest rates have not risen at the speed or to the extent such that the protective cashflows provided by the caps and swaps have been realized 
the company may also utilizes futures and options on futures to moderate the risks inherent in the financing of a portion of its investment portfolio with floating rate repurchase agreements 
the company uses these instruments to synthetically lengthen the terms of repurchase agreement financing  generally from one to three or six months 
interest rate futures and option agreements have historically provided the company a means of essentially locking in borrowing costs at specified rates for specified period of time 
under these contracts  the company will receive additional cash flow if the underlying index increases above contracted rates  mitigating the net interest income loss that results from the higher repurchase agreement rates the company will pay additional cash flow if the underlying index decreases below contracted rates 
the company has not utilized futures or options on futures since  as they primarily benefit the company when expected rates as measured by the forward yield curve are less than current cash market rates 
interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that the company utilizes to manage certain interest rate risks represent protection for the earnings and cashflow of the investment portfolio in adverse markets 
to date  market conditions have not been adverse such that the caps and swaps have been utilized 
the remaining portion of the company s investments portfolio as of december   approximately billion  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are either fixed or do not reset within the next months 
the company has limited its interest rate risk on such investments through i the issuance of fixed rate collateralized bonds and notes payable  and ii equity  which in the aggregate totals approximately billion as of the same date 
overall  the company s interest rate risk is primarily related to the rate of change in short term interest rates  not the level of short term interest rates
