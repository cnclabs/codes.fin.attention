item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the company has reported losses from operations in each of the past five years due to inefficiencies within its operations 
as a result of such losses  the company had an accumulated deficit of  at january  the company s management  which underwent a substantial restructuring after the financings discussed under liquidity and capital resources  has developed a strategic plan for the business which provides  among other things  for remodeling showrooms to provide a more appealing setting for customers  adding new showrooms  increasing product prices to competitive levels  reducing promotional discounting  reconfiguring selling commissions  remerchandising  refocusing advertising  improving the manufacturing processes and reducing expenses through budgetary controls 
these plans have been implemented since the latter part of fiscal  are believed to have contributed significantly to reducing losses and are expected to ultimately return the company to profitability  however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve profitability 
management believes that the company has sufficient sources of financing to continue operations throughout fiscal however  the company s long term success is dependent upon management s ability to successfully execute its strategic plan and  ultimately  to achieve sustained profitable operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal cash needs are for funding capital expenditures to open new showrooms and remodel existing showrooms  manufacturing samples of upholstered furniture for display in its new and existing showrooms as well as to purchase merchandise from other manufacturers that complement the upholstered furniture manufactured and displayed by the company  and for funding capital expenditures related to the improvement and maintenance of its management information systems 
the cash required for funding production and fulfillment of customer orders is typically provided by the company s customers from a deposit made at the time an order is placed 
beginning in fiscal  the company will also require cash to make the scheduled principal payments on its subordinated notes 
in recent periods  the company has incurred additional debt and raised equity capital to cover operating deficits and to finance the remodeling and expansion of its showrooms 
in fiscal  management plans to remodel and upgrade existing showrooms  as well as add to additional showrooms  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
management expects to fund such capital expenditures by internally generated cash and by borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
as of march   the company has executed leases for new stores  three of which will replace existing stores upon expiration of leases 
the company is not contractually committed to make the remainder of these capital expenditures and could slow its expansion and remodeling program if the company experiences any liquidity shortages 
in may  the company raised approximately million through the issuance of convertible notes to certain related party investors 
in august and september  gecc and certain other investors led by mr 
philip m 
hawley  the company s current chairman and chief executive officer  invested million in the company 
in connection with this financing  the company i issued approximately million of common stock  of which million was purchased by gecc and approximately million was issued to the holders of convertible notes in cancellation thereof  and ii issued to gecc a promissory note in the principal amount of million  together with a warrant to purchase million shares at 
per share 
also in connection with this financing  the holders of shares of the company s pre existing preferred stock agreed to convert their shares into approximately million shares of common stock 
on august   the company completed transactions with two investors in which it issued million of subordinated notes with i warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at per share and ii warrants to purchase an aggregate amount of up to  shares of common stock at per share which warrants may be completely or partially cancelled depending on the economic performance of the company in fiscal also  the company arranged a standby credit facility of million which the company drew down on december  at the time the standby credit facility was drawn down  the company issued to the investors warrants to purchase  additional shares of common stock at per share 
in april  the company issued approximately  additional shares of common stock in a public secondary offering 
net proceeds to the company were approximately million 
in march  the company s existing revolving line of credit with congress financial corporation western was amended the revolving credit facility to increase the maximum commitment available from million to million  subject to borrowing base limitations  and to extend the maturity date to march  the revolving credit facility accrues interest at a rate of prime plus a margin ranging from 
to based upon the company s ebitda performance and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
as of january   the company had unused borrowing capacity of approximately million under the original terms of its revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the agreements related to the company s subordinated notes  as well as under the terms of the revolving credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants and is prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness from third parties in an amount in excess of million 
the company believes that borrowings under its revolving credit facility and internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its requirements for working capital and capital expenditures through the end of fiscal year however  the company may need to raise additional funds to finance its remodeling and expansion program through either debt or equity financing  and there can be no assurance that the company s financial performance will generate sufficient funds 
the company currently contemplates that other sources of capital would be available  although this situation could change 
the aggregate annual maturities of long term debt during each of the five fiscal years subsequent to january  are approximately as follows  in   in   in   in  and  in management anticipates such payments will be made out of operating cash flow  draws under the revolving credit facility or through refinancing

year readiness disclosure in the past  computer engineers designed most computer programs and embedded computer chips to use only two digits to specify a particular year 
for example  the digits were used to specify the year however  computers that use only two digits cannot properly recognize the year or any following years 
for example  after the year  the digits could mean either the year or the year this problem can cause computers and other electronic devices to give erroneous results or to shut down 
therefore  as dates employing the year and following years come into use  computer programs will need to use four digits to distinguish between the different years of the th and the st century 
because of this year problem  the company and many other enterprises are vulnerable to unforeseen or unanticipated problems with their computer systems and equipment containing embedded computer chips  as well as from problems in the computer systems of other parties on which their businesses rely 
the company has a year program in place to minimize any possible effect on its business resulting from the year problem 
the company has evaluated its information technology it systems and believes it has identified those that were not year compliant 
the company upgraded its payroll system to be year compliant in the third quarter of fiscal and its other mission critical business systems manufacturing  procurement  order processing and accounting in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company has completed testing  implementation  and has conducted an end to end year simulation test to validate compliance for its key business processes 
the company has also assessed its desktops  communications systems and other it related equipment 
remaining upgrades will be completed within the first quarter of the company expects to bring its it systems into compliance without incurring material costs 
to date it has completed the remediation of business systems by redirecting its existing internal programming resources  with costs expensed as incurred 
the company expects total costs to be less than  with regard to non it systems  the company is continuing to assess its facilities equipment  including but not limited to bank card terminals  alarm systems and fax machines 
these are being reviewed for year compliance 
disruption of these services would have a negligible impact on company operations and remediation costs are expected to be less than  the company plans to achieve readiness in this area by the second quarter of depending on whether suppliers and other entities with which the company does business are able to successfully address the year issue  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given future reporting period during which such a year event occurs 
as a result  the company is communicating with such entities to determine their state of readiness 
the company is also developing contingency plans to allow primary operations of the company to continue if the company s significant systems or such entities are disrupted by the year problem 
the company expects that its contingency plans will be developed by the end of the second quarter of  and that it will be prepared in the event of systems failures to continue to do business  although such operations may be at a higher cost 
at worst  if the company s it systems failed  the company could use manual systems to process furniture orders and manage its manufacturing processes  but with a significant sacrifice in speed and efficiency 
if the it systems of the company s suppliers failed  the company could experience significant delays in delivery of materials that would  in turn  delay production and customer deliveries 
these estimates and conclusions contain forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially 
new developments may occur that could affect the company s estimates  such as the amount of planning and modification needed to achieve full resolution of the year problem  the availability and cost of resources  the company s ability to discover and correct all year sensitive computer code and equipment  and the ability of suppliers and other entities to bring their systems into compliance 
recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted the financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income in fiscal this statement requires that all items that meet the definition of components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized 
components of comprehensive income include revenues  expenses  gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income 
there are no differences between the company s net loss  as reported  and comprehensive loss as defined  for the periods presented as of january  the company has also adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information in fiscal the company believes it operates in only one business segment 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop no 
pre opening costs 
this statement provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up costs and organization costs 
the company adopted this sop in fiscal and it did not materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
emerging issues task force eitf no 
accounting for contingent rent in interim financial periods requires lessee s to recognize contingent rental expense in interim periods if the achievement of future targets that trigger such contingency is considered to be probable 
the company s method of accounting for contingent rent is consistent with the requirements of eitf no 
market risk exposure the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its variable rate debt which consists of revolving credit notes issued to a financial institution 
the company does not use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
historically  the company has used debt financing for funding its capital investments in new and remodeled showrooms and for funding cash used in operations 
the company s debt consists primarily of fixed rate subordinated debt with attached warrants  variable rate revolving credit notes and other fixed rate notes payable 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
the company has managed its exposure to changes in interest rates by issuing part of its debt with fixed interest rates and part with variable interest rates 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of the year would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amount and the average nominal interest rates for the debt in each category based on the final maturity dates and applicable amortization schedules for the fixed rate debt 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows using current rates the company believes would be available to it if it were to enter the market for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 
the subordinated debt was issued with common stock warrants 
the fair value of the subordinated debt has been determined inclusive of the warrants and using an interest rate that the company believes would be available to it for a similar debt instrument issued with warrants having similar terms 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate subordinated notes      average interest rate variable rate notes    average interest rate fixed rate other notes payable   average interest rate the company does not believe that the future market rate risks related to the above securities will have a material impact on the company or the results of its future operations
