item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview uti is a leading provider of onshore contract drilling services to exploration and production companies and operates one of the largest land drilling rig fleets in the united states 
the company s drilling operations are currently concentrated in the prolific oil and natural gas producing basins of texas  oklahoma and new mexico 
the company s rig fleet consists of land drilling rigs that are well suited to the requirements of its markets 
the company s contract drilling services are performed through four regional drilling units and are marketed under the names fwa drilling company  fwa peterson drilling company  southland drilling company and triad drilling company 
the company also provides pressure pumping services in the appalachian basin 
beginning in  the company made a strategic decision to focus its efforts on the expansion of its land drilling operations to take advantage of improving market conditions and the benefits arising from a consolidation in the land drilling industry 
to effect this strategy  the company disposed of its oilfield distribution business in september and immediately embarked on a directed acquisition program aimed at expanding the company s presence in the oil and natural gas producing regions in the united states 
pursuant to this strategy  the company acquired rigs in five transactions during  and the company acquired an additional rigs in three transactions during as a result of these acquisitions and increased rig utilization and dayrates caused by favorable market conditions  the company s revenues grew substantially during and during the latter part of and during  however  the company and the united states contract drilling industry  in general  experienced significant declines in demand and pricing for their services 
as a result of these depressed market conditions  the company s fleet utilization decreased to in from in and dayrates also decreased 
in response to these depressed industry conditions  the company undertook a series of actions during the third quarter of designed to improve efficiency  increase productivity and make the company more competitive in the market place 
these actions included the streamlining of certain contract drilling operations  certain personnel changes and changes to the accounting and administrative functions  including the relocation of certain accounting functions from oklahoma city to the company s corporate headquarters in houston 
this consolidation of operations reduced the company s number of regional operating units from nine to seven and reduced the company s administrative staff by twenty individuals 
as a result of these actions  the company recorded a one time other charge during of 
million  which included approximately 
million of employee related expenses 
the company further reduced operating overhead by consolidating regional operations offices in oklahoma and the permian basin and by implementing additional staff reductions  which will result in a charge during the first quarter of of approximately 
million 
in addition  the company sold certain non strategic assets of its appalachian basin contract drilling division for million  which will result in the company recording a one time gain of approximately million during the first quarter of as a result of these initiatives  the company believes that it has brought its cost and operating structure more in line with current industry conditions and has strengthened its balance sheet 
in this regard  as of march   the company had million in cash and no borrowings under its million credit facility 
the company currently does not expect market conditions in the contract drilling industry to improve until commodity prices for oil and natural gas increase substantially 
in this regard  the company has continued to see utilization rates and dayrates decrease during the first quarter of and expects its average utilization during the first quarter of to be less than the average utilization experienced during the fourth quarter of dayrates and contract prices for footage and turnkey wells also have declined during the first quarter of although conditions in the contract drilling industry have significantly declined over prior periods and further declines are possible  the company believes that its strong liquidity position and balance sheet provide it with the financial flexibility to withstand continued or additional deterioration in market conditions and react quickly to opportunities in the contract drilling industry 
results of operations the company views the number of rigs actively drilling in the united states as a barometer of the overall strength of the domestic oilfield service industry 
without giving effect to acquisitions  variations in revenues and gross margins of the company s core business generally follow the rig count trend

its active rig count is generally regarded as an industry standard for measuring industry activity levels 
an operating day is defined as a day during which a rig is being operated  mobilized  assembled or dismantled while under contract 
utilization rates are based on a day year and are calculated by dividing the number of rigs utilized by the total number of rigs in the company s drilling fleet  including stacked rigs 
a rig is considered utilized when it is being operated  mobilized  assembled or dismantled while under contract 
for the year ended december   the utilization rate of the company s rigs  excluding stacked rigs  was

inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s comparative results of operations 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
to date  the company has fully completed its assessment of all systems that it believes could be significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems could be affected  particularly the general ledger accounting system 
the company does not believe that the year issue presents a material exposure as it relates to the company s services 
in addition  the company has gathered information about the year compliance status of its significant suppliers and subcontractors and continues to monitor their compliance 
for its information technology exposures  to date  the company is complete on the remediation phase and expects to complete software reprogramming and replacement no later than july  once software is reprogrammed or replaced for a system  the company begins testing and implementation 
these phases run concurrently for different systems with all remediated systems expected to be fully tested and implemented by august  with completion targeted for october  the company has contacted its significant suppliers and subcontractors and  to date  the company is not aware of any third parties with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that third parties will be year ready 
the inability of third parties to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company by causing such third parties to fail to timely deliver or supply needed material and services to or on behalf of the company  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s ability to deliver its services in a timely and cost effective manner in accordance with company standards or by causing third party customer s operations to temporarily shut down or delay operations  thereby materially affecting demand for the company s services 
the effect of non compliance by third parties is not determinable 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
to date  the company has incurred approximately 
million for new systems related to all phases of the year project  which has been capitalized 
the total remaining project costs is attributable to the purchase of new software and operating equipment  which will also be capitalized 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issues in a timely manner 
however  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year project 
disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  including equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of the year project 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion in july and determine whether such plans are necessary

risks associated with forward looking statements from time to time  the company may make certain statements that contain forward looking information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 
words such as anticipate  believe  expect  estimate  project and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing  including but not limited to  in press releases  as part of the business  properties and management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations contained in this report and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of and the securities exchange act of although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including without limitation those identified below 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should any of the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results of current and future operations may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their dates 
among the factors that will have a direct bearing on the company s results of operations and the contract drilling service industry in which it operates are changes in the prices of oil and natural gas and the volatility of the contract drilling service industry in general  including the effects of recent downturns in prices for oil and natural gas  and risks that a continuation of current industry conditions or further decline in industry conditions will adversely effect the demand for and pricing of the company s services  any difficulties associated with the company s ability to successfully integrate recent acquisitions  contractual risk associated with turnkey and footage contracts  the presence of competitors with greater financial resources  labor shortages  operating risks inherent in the contract drilling service industry  such as blowouts  explosions  cratering  sour gas  well fires and spills  labor shortages  domestic and world wide political stability and economic growth  risks associated with the year issue and other risks associated with the company s successful execution of internal operating plans as well as regulatory uncertainties and legal proceedings 
the risks related to the year issue and the dates on which the company believes its year project will be completed are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with the implementation of the company s year project 
specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results  include but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced and similar uncertainties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year project  resulting in part from uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties and the interconnection of global businesses  the company cannot ensure its ability to timely and cost effectively resolve problems associated with the year issue that may affect its operations and business or expose it to third party liability
