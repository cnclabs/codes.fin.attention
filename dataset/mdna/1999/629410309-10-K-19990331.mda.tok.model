if there is a need to obtain additional financing there is no assurance as to whether or on what terms any financing may be available 
year compliance the company  with the assistance of independent outside consultants  has been assessing its year computer readiness and exposure to year issues  which relates to the inability of computer software programs to recognize the arrival of the year because of a common software design feature that describes the current year by only its last two digits 
in connection with such assessment  the company initiated a review of the information technology systems utilized in the company s business and operations 
based on this review  the company has segregated its systems into two categories mission critical and support systems 
mission critical systems are characterized as hardware and applications contributing to the income of the business 
support systems are characterized as systems that organize and create efficiencies for the corporation but are not critical to its operations 
the company is in the process of assessing these key systems for compliance 
the assessment phase is expected to be completed by the second quarter of  and the renovation phase completed by the third quarter 
the company s mission critical systems are segregated into location deployed and back end systems which support both the new and current networks  for which the company will incur expected costs of approximately  to ensure year compliancy 
the company is evaluating and testing year compliance at the system bios  operating system and applications levels 
the company has preliminarily determined that of location systems may not be year compliant due to the inaccurate roll over of the system bios which could compromise content scheduling 
the replacement of these systems is estimated to be approximately  per location 
all systems in the new network are expected to be year compliant 
the company has identified a few key back end systems that will require an upgrade of commercial hardware and data base software 
as can be determined thus far  the operating systems and company developed applications are not affected but are being verified for compliance 
the company intends to fund these costs with cash on hand  leases from vendors and internally generated funds 
the company has also initiated a review of year compliance by its principal vendors  and this estimate assumes that the company will not incur significant year related costs on behalf of its vendors or other third parties 
concerning the support systems  all corporate personal computers and servers have been deemed year compliant 
the operating systems and commercial software packages have been upgraded to compliant versions 
the company s most likely worst case scenario is that the company would be unable to broadcast its programs to its network services customers 
network services revenue represents of total revenues for the year ended december  the company has not yet established a contingency plan in the event that this occurs 
as a result  a widespread or extended failure of the company s internal systems  or systems of third parties  to be year compliant would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the accounting standards executive committee acsec issued a statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on consolidated results  financial condition or long term liquidity 
risk factors that may affect future results the company s business  results of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the following history of significant losses  recent results of operations 
the company has a history of significant losses  including net losses of   and  for the three years ended december   and an accumulated deficit of  as of december  the results of operations during these periods included substantial charges related to the resignation or termination of certain former executive officers  write downs of assets associated with discontinued business activities and shrinkage and obsolescence of equipment  accruals for litigation settlement costs and other litigation expenses  and charges relating to stock based compensation 
the company may incur similar charges in the future  and there is no assurance that the company will ever operate profitably

recent equipment problems the playmaker r is a hand held  megahertz radio frequency device used to enter choices and selections by players of qb r and other games and programming broadcast via the ntn network tm 
customers have experienced certain recurring problems with playmakers r related to noise sensitivity and performance of the playmaker s r rechargeable batteries 
management believes these equipment problems contributed to higher than usual terminations and bad debt experience during late and the first half of to address these problems  the company has designed a megahertz playmaker r in consultation with an outside engineering consulting firm 
the redesigned playmaker r is currently being manufactured by the manufacturer of the megahertz playmaker and will be deployed in the marketplace in conjunction with the launch of ntn s new network 
there can be no assurance that equipment problems will not occur with the redesigned playmakers and the continuance of such problems in the future could adversely affect our results of operations 
dependence on licenses for broadcast rights  lack of certain licenses ntn s interactive sports games are broadcast in conjunction with live telecasts of football  baseball and hockey games and other events 
wherever possible  the company tries to obtain licenses from the owners of the broadcast rights to the events to utilize such telecasts for our interactive game programming 
ntn s exclusive license with national football league properties  inc nflp for qb r expires in march the rights under the license may not be transferred or assigned without the nflp s consent  and an assignment for this purpose includes  among other things  a merger or consolidation of ntn or the termination of employment of any key management personnel 
ntn s agreement with major league baseball properties  inc mlbp relating to diamondball r expired december  since then  the company has continued to broadcast diamondball r without a license 
qb r s broadcast in conjunction with college football games is without any license 
limitations on sports licenses or legal action by the owners or licensees of broadcast rights to college football games or other events for which ntn has no license could preclude ntn from broadcasting our games in connection with these events or result in an award of monetary damages against the company 
the company has not experienced any such legal action to date  and is unaware of any threatened action 
there is no assurance  however  that such actions will not be brought in the future 
competition the company s programming competes generally with broadcast television  pay per view and other content offered on cable television 
in other media  ntn competes with other content and services available to the consumer through america online and other online services 
with the entrance of motion picture  cable and tv companies  competition in the interactive entertainment and multimedia industries will likely intensify in the future 
recently  for example  the walt disney company introduced interactive programming broadcast in conjunction with live sporting and other events which may compete directly with qb r and our other programming 
moreover  the expanded use of online networks and the internet provide computer users an increasing number of alternatives to video games and entertainment software 
ntn seeks to compete by providing high quality products at reasonable prices  thereby establishing a favorable reputation among frequent buyers 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company can compete effectively 
potential for technological obsolescence the computer industry and related businesses are marked by rapid and significant technological development and change 
it is possible that the company s interactive technology and services will be rendered obsolete by ongoing technological developments 
there also is no assurance that ntn will be able to respond effectively to technological changes 
uncertain proprietary protection  dependence on sole source of supply the company regards the playmaker r keyboard and other technology utilized in the ntn network tm as proprietary and relies on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements to protect our propriety rights 
ntn has one patent application pending for our proprietary interactive technology 
there is no assurance  however  that any patent will issue or that any issued patent will provide significant competitive advantages 
it is the company s policy that all employees and consultants involved in research and developmental activities sign nondisclosure agreements  however  this may not afford sufficient protection for know how and proprietary information and products 
other parties may independently develop similar or more advanced technologies 
as a number of software products in the interactive television industry increases and increasingly become available in new delivery formats  software developers and publishers may increasingly become subject to infringement claims 
any such claims or litigation brought against the company could be costly and could have an adverse effect on the business and results or operations 
the fleetwood group  inc of holland  michigan  has requested assurance that ntn s mhz playmakers do not infringe on fleetwood s patent for a mhz wireless communication system marketed as reply r ps 
the company currently purchases playmaker r keyboards from a single  unaffiliated taiwanese manufacturer  and has regularly experienced delays in obtaining new playmakers r 
the company recently designed a megahertz playmaker r and have solicited bids for manufacture of the new playmaker r 
there can be no assurance  however  that we can secure additional sources of supply of the redesigned playmaker r 
unless and until ntn succeeds in establishing additional manufacturing relationships  ntn will continue to be dependent on the current sole source of supply of playmaker r and may continue to experience delays and technical problems in playmakers r shipments 
volatility of stock price  recent trading prices historically  the trading price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely  and it may be subject to similar future fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements regarding litigation  technological innovations or new products introduced by ntn or our competitors  general industry conditions and other events or factors  including factors such as analysts expectations which are beyond management s control 
in addition  in recent years and months  broad stock market indices  in general  and the securities of small cap companies such as ntn  in particular  have experienced substantial price fluctuations 
such broad market fluctuations also may adversely affect the future trading price of the common stock 
the recent trading prices of the common stock have been at or near the historical lows  and it is possible that the company will experience further declines in the trading price in the future 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters for more information on historical trading prices of the common stock 
effect of outstanding options and warrants at march   there were approximately  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
at march   there were also outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock at current exercise prices ranging from to per share 
substantially all of the shares underlying these outstanding warrants are subject to currently effective registration statements covering the resale of the underlying warrant shares by the holders 
the foregoing options and warrants could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions  since the holders of those options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by such options and warrants 
for the life of such options and warrants  the holders are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock without assuming the risk of ownership 
to the extent the trading price of the common stock at the time of exercise of any such options or warrants exceeds the exercise price  such exercise will also have a dilutive effect on our stockholders  including purchases of the offered shares 
the company recently received a letter from certain investors to whom the company sold shares of common stock in a private placement in april claiming that they are entitled to receive additional shares of common stock as a result of antidilution adjustments contained in their stock purchase agreements with ntn 
based on the company s review of this matter  the company will be required to issue these investors  additional shares 
shares eligible for future sale approximately  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  are restricted securities  as that term is defined under rule promulgated under the act 
all or substantially all of such shares are covered by currently effective registration statements and can be offered and sold publicly by the beneficial owners at any time so long as registration statements remain effective 
moreover  in general under rule as currently in effect  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  if one year has elapsed since the later of the date of acquisition of restricted shares from an issuer or from an affiliate of an issuer  the acquiror or subsequent holder is entitled to sell in the open market  within any three month period  a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of of the outstanding shares of the same class or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of the required notice of sale 
a person who has not been an affiliate of ntn for at least the three months immediately preceding the sale and who has beneficially owned shares of common stock as described above for at least two years is entitled to sell such shares under rule k without regard to any of the limitations described above 
no predictions can be made with respect to the effect that sales of common stock in the market or the availability of shares of common stock for sale pursuant to currently effective registration statements or under rule will have on the market price of common stock prevailing from time to time 
nevertheless  the possibility that substantial amounts of common stock may be sold in the public market may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock and could impair ntn s ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities
