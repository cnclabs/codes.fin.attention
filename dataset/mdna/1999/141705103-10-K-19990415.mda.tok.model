this discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
unless the context otherwise requires  as used herein  the term medpartners or the company refers collectively to medpartners  inc and its subsidiaries and affiliates 
general medpartners operates one of the largest independent pbm companies in the united states  with net revenue of approximately billion for the year ended december  the company manages pbm programs for clients throughout the united states  including corporations  insurance companies  unions  government employee groups and managed care organizations

these services include the design  development and management of comprehensive programs comprising drug therapy  physician support and patient education 
the company currently provides therapies and services for individuals with such conditions as hemophilia  growth disorders  immune deficiencies  cystic fibrosis  multiple sclerosis and infants with respiratory difficulties 
on november   the company announced that cpg  which includes its pbm business  would become its core operating unit 
the company also announced its intention to divest its other businesses 
as a result the company has restated its prior period financial statements to reflect the appropriate accounting for these discontinued operations 
additionally  a loss on disposal of discontinued operations charge of billion was recorded during the fourth quarter of on january   the company completed the sale of its government services business for million less certain working capital adjustments 
on march   the company completed the sale of its team health business for million  less certain expenses  and retained approximately of the equity of the recapitalized company 
on march   the company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of the assets of the physician practice management business that provides services to the multi specialty physicians group  kelsey seybold medical group  pa the purchaser is a joint venture between st 
luke s episcopal health system and methodist health care system 
the joint venture will acquire the medpartners and kelsey seybold management services agreement and related assets valued at approximately million  and the new holcombe building  a major new site for kelsey seybold  and other assets valued at approximately million 
the transaction is subject to customary regulatory and board approvals and closing conditions 
results of operations for the years ended december   and continuing operations for the years ended december    and  net revenue was  million   million and  million  representing increases of million and million during and  respectively 
this growth is entirely internal and has not been supplemented by acquisitions 
key factors contributing to this growth include high customer retention  increased sales to retained customers  new customer contracts and drug cost inflation 
these growth factors were partially offset in and by selective non renewal of certain accounts not meeting threshold profitability levels 
the preponderance of the company s revenue is earned on a fee for service basis through contracts covering one to three year periods 
revenues for selected types of services are earned based on a percentage of savings achieved or on a per enrollee or per member basis  however  these revenues are not material to total revenues 
operating income was  and million in  and  respectively 
operating margins were  and for these same periods 
the operating income and margin decrease in was due almost entirely to a million loss recognized on a risk share contract 
this particular contract was the only significant pbm risk share contract 
during  the company renegotiated this risk share contract  changing it to a fee for service arrangement beginning in adjusting for the impact of the million loss contract reserve  operating margins for and were comparable 
operating income represents earnings before interest and income taxes and excludes merger expenses and restructuring and impairment charges 
in  the company incurred merger expenses of million related to the acquisition of caremark 
this charge primarily related to transaction costs such as investment banking and legal fees 
also included in this amount were charges relating to occupancy costs for excess facilities and elimination of certain information systems in the pbm business 
restructuring expenses totaled million in and million in these charges primarily related to severance and occupancy costs for excess facilities 
net interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the year over year increases in interest expense primarily resulted from increased debt levels 
increases in debt levels were a result of substantial uses of cash in the company s discontinued operations for acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the net interest expense allocated to the discontinued operations was limited by generally accepted accounting principles  accordingly  the interest expense allocated to continuing operations is not necessarily indicative of the net interest expense those operations would have incurred as an independent entity on a stand alone basis 
under statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for income taxes sfas  the company is required to record a net deferred tax asset for the future tax benefits of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as for other temporary differences  if realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management has considered reversing deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
however  the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible and net operating losses can be carried forward 
management believes  considering all available information  including the company s history of earnings after adjustments for nonrecurring items  restructuring charges  permanent differences  and other appropriate items and after considering appropriate tax planning strategies  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the company has recorded a valuation allowance for million  which is the amount of the deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance has been established due to the uncertainty of forecasting future income and also covers certain net operating losses of non consolidated entities that can only offset future taxable income generated by those entities 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf accounting for costs incurred in connection with a consulting contract or an internal project that combines business process reengineering and information technology eitf 
eitf requires process reengineering costs  as defined  which had been previously capitalized as part of an information technology project to be written off as a cumulative catch up adjustment in the fourth quarter of the company recorded a charge of million  net of tax of million  as a result of eitf the company incurred such costs primarily in connection with the process reengineering associated with the new operating systems installed for its pbm operations 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued a statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires that the costs of start up activities be expensed as incurred 
the company recorded a charge of million  net of tax of million  as a cumulative effect adjustment retroactive to january  discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations includes losses from the company s ppm business  contract services business  international business and cii s previously reported discontinued operations 
discontinued operations for reflects a million after tax charge related to cii s settlement with private payors discussed in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and merger charges of million for acquisitions in the ppm and contract services businesses 
discontinued operations for includes a fourth quarter restructuring and impairment charge of million 
this charge relates primarily to the restructuring and impairment of selected assets of certain clinic operations within the ppm business and includes goodwill impairment and other asset write downs 
also included in the discontinued operations loss for are merger charges of million for acquisitions in the ppm and contract services businesses 
discontinued operations for include a charge taken in the fourth quarter of billion 
this charge consists primarily of the non cash write off of intangibles  the company s deferred tax assets and other ppm assets 
the remainder of the charge reflects the future cash costs of exiting the ppm business 
also included in the net loss from discontinued operations for are losses of billion for the operations of these discontinued operations 
other matters year compliance 
the year yk presents a problem for computer software and hardware that were not designed to handle dates beyond the year the yk problem is pervasive and complex because virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the last two digits of the year to as a consequence  any such software and hardware will need to be modified some time prior to december  in order to remain functional 
computer systems and hardware that do not properly handle this rollover could generate erroneous data or fail to function 
the company has initiated a company wide program to address the yk problem with respect to the information systems software and hardware and equipment and systems utilized in the company s operations 
the program includes an inventory of the information systems  hardware  and equipment the systems  hardware and equipment utilized in operations  an assessment of the yk issues associated with the systems  hardware and equipment  the remediation of such systems  hardware and equipment to achieve yk readiness yk readiness or yk ready  the testing of such systems  hardware and equipment to confirm yk readiness  and the development of contingency plans to address yk and the principal risks facing the company in its efforts to achieve yk readiness 
the company s yk program also includes its trading partners initiative  which is designed to provide the company with insights into the yk readiness of certain of the company s customers  suppliers and vendors 
in addition  the company has sent letters to certain manufacturers of the hardware and equipment utilized in operations requesting that such manufacturers address the yk readiness of such hardware and equipment 
in terms of the status of the company s yk program  including systems related to discontinued operations  management believes that the company s inventory of information systems is approximately complete  that its assessment of yk issues associated with such information systems is approximately complete and that its remediation efforts with respect to such information systems is approximately complete 
with respect to the status of the company s yk efforts with respect to equipment and systems that include embedded logic or software which presents yk issues  management believes that the inventory of such equipment and systems is approximately complete 
the company s assessment of yk issues associated with such equipment and systems is approximately complete and its remediation efforts with respect to such equipment and systems is approximately complete 
the company expects to complete its assessment of all of these areas by june the company expects to commence testing efforts with respect to the systems  hardware and equipment following the completion of the inventory and assessment stages of its yk program 
the company has not  to date  received substantial responses to its requests of customers  suppliers and vendors with respect to their yk readiness 
as a result  management is currently unable to form an opinion as to the present level of risk associated with the state of yk readiness of the company s customers  vendors and suppliers  other than a belief that the yk issues generally associated with the healthcare industry are very significant and complex and include issues associated with the delivery of healthcare services and products as well as the billing and collection of amounts due for such services and products 
according to a recent report the report by the senate special subcommittee on the year technology problem  the healthcare industry lags behind other industries in yk preparedness 
while  according to the report  the pharmaceutical segment appears to be better yk prepared than other segments of the healthcare industry  the preparedness of health claim billing systems of third party payors is progressing slowly 
management of the company believes that the company s yk program will be substantially completed by the third quarter of the company estimates that the total cost of the yk program  including million in costs associated with discontinued operations  will be approximately million  of which approximately million has been spent through december  of such aggregate yk expenditures made to date  management currently estimates that approximately million consisted of capital expenditures for new or replacement systems  hardware and equipment and approximately million consisted of expenses of the yk program 
the source of the funding utilized to make such historical expenditures has been borrowings under the company s credit facility and cash flow from operations 
management of the company believes that a significant amount of the funds spent to date and budgeted in the future for achieving yk readiness would otherwise have been spent and budgeted in connection with the company s ongoing information technology consolidation efforts to reduce the number of information systems and hardware platforms utilized in its operations and acquired through the company s various acquisition transactions over the years 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worse case scenario with respect to yk issues is the possibility that equipment and systems that include embedded logic or software will fail to be yk ready and that such failure will cause such equipment to fail to operate or operate improperly 
the failure of such equipment may expose individual patients to potential injury and may expose the company to claims and liabilities 
at this time the company cannot estimate the likelihood or magnitude of any such equipment or systems failures 
the company has not established a contingency plan for the failure of such equipment or systems but plans to establish such a plan during in conjunction with the implementation of the yk program 
the yk problems experienced by the company s vendors  suppliers and distribution network could result in the company experiencing difficulty in obtaining and distributing prescription drugs or pharmaceutical therapies  thereby disrupting the company s pbm business as historically conducted 
yk problems experienced by hmos  other third party payors and the government agencies which administer medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored healthcare programs  may result in delays in payments to the company for services or in erroneous payments for such services which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and liquidity 
the foregoing discussion involves the estimates and judgments of the senior management of the company 
there can be no assurances that the company will be yk ready or that the company will not incur liability or suffer a material adverse effect as a result of the company s failure to be yk ready 
in addition  there can be no assurances that the estimated expenses to make the company yk ready will not be materially higher than estimated or that the company will not incur additional expenses associated with its efforts to get yk ready or its failure to do so 
factors that may affect future results the future operating results and financial condition of the company are dependent on the company s ability to market its services profitably  successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth 
the future operating results and financial condition of the company may be affected by a number of additional factors  including the company s divestiture of its discontinued operations  the proposed settlement and transition plan to exit its ppm operations in the state of california  the company s compliance with or changes in government regulations  including pharmacy licensing requirements and healthcare reform legislation  potentially adverse resolution of lawsuits pending against the company and its affiliates  declining reimbursement levels of products distributed  identification of growth opportunities  implementation of the company s strategic plan  liabilities potentially in excess of insurance risks  the company s liquidity and capital requirements  and the company s potential failure to ensure its information systems are year compliant 
changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the future operating results and financial condition of the company 
there are various legal matters which  if materially adversely determined  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company has experienced positive cash flow from continuing operations for each of the last three fiscal years 
this positive cash flow has been offset by the company s investing activities  primarily capital expenditures  and cash used in the discontinued operations 
the cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million  offset by net capital expenditures of million and cash used in discontinued operations of million 
the combined cash used in discontinued operations of billion over the last three years is the primary cause of the company s significant debt level of billion at december  on june   the company entered into an amendment and restatement of its billion credit facility with nationsbank  na as administrative agent 
the credit facility is unsecured  but is guaranteed by the company s material subsidiaries 
the credit facility consists of the following i 
a one year non amortizing term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to million the company has an option to extend the term loan for an additional two years as an amortizing term loan million outstanding at december   ii 
a three year non amortizing term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to million million outstanding at december   and iii 
a three year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million million in outstanding borrowings and million in letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  resulting in million in available borrowing capacity at december  effective december   the company amended its credit facility to permit a million accounts receivable securitization 
the company has securitized certain of its accounts receivables with the chase manhattan bank as funding agent 
this facility provides approximately million in liquidity to the company 
effective january   the company entered into an amendment to its credit facility  bringing it in line with the company s new corporate strategy of separating from its ppm business to focus on its cpg business 
the credit agreement provides for of the first million in net cash proceeds received from asset sales after december  to be used to reduce the company s outstanding debt under its term loans 
the remaining of such net asset sales proceeds  up to a maximum of million  is available to the company for use in its business and operations in the ordinary course 
all net cash proceeds in excess of million from such asset sales are to be used to reduce the company s outstanding debt under its term loans 
effective april   the company entered into an amendment to its credit facility to modify the terms of its credit agreement concerning the company s proposed settlement with the state of california see note on april  the terms of the agreement were modified to among other things a permit the company to enter into a comprehensive settlement agreement and transition plan the california transition plan with the state of california and certain health care service plans  b permit the sale or other disposition of all of the property and assets of the company s california ppm operations  with proceeds remaining in the california ppm operations to satisfy liabilities and obligations of the company s california ppm operations  c to increase to million of which million is available solely to pay amounts under certain promissory notes  from million  the amount of net asset sale proceeds available to the company for use in its business and operations in the ordinary course  and d modify certain financial ratios for periods ending on or after march  the company s discontinued operations will continue to use significant amounts of cash until the company divests such operations 
proceeds from the sales of these operations will be used to reduce the term loans and the revolver to the extent required under the amended credit agreement 
cash used to fund exit costs  which are classified in current liabilities as other accrued expenses and liabilities  will be funded by the revolving credit facility and cash flow from continuing operations 
the company believes that amounts available from the sales of discontinued operations  amounts available under its revolving credit facility and cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements 
however  if the cash generated from such sources is insufficient to fund discontinued operations until they are divested  or if the company is unable to successfully implement its divestiture strategy in a timely manner  the company s liquidity position could be adversely affected 
on april   the company and representatives of the state of california the state have signed a letter of intent to settle the disputes relating to mpn 
the proposed settlement provides for a loan of up to million from certain health care services plans to the company or  as designated by the company  purchasers of mpn s and the company s physician practice assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to its long term debt
