industry trends conditions for semiconductor device manufacturers appear to be improving  as factory utilization rates increased above the level according to vlsi research  inc a number of fabs are adding capacity and investing in capital equipment  and some customers are converting existing mm fabs to mm 
a few mm pilot lines exist or are expected to come on line  however  fsi does not expect significant mm spending until calendar pc shipments improved in the last few quarters  particularly in the asia pacific region 
according to international data corp  worldwide pc unit shipments grew in calendar second quarter  compared to the prior year  and from the first quarter 
accelerated growth in communications and internet related products also fueled improving industry conditions 
although the rate of order growth for semiconductor equipment manufacturers slowed during calendar third quarter  industry analysts currently predict moderate growth in booking activity through calendar dataquest s july forecast estimates growth in the resist processing available market and in the surface conditioning available market in calendar due to factors such as shrinks  capacity constraints  new materials such as copper and low k dielectrics  and mm pilot programs 
foundries  semiconductor manufacturers producing devices for companies that do not have fabs fabless  often located in the asia pacific region  are forecasted to make significant capital equipment investments over the next few years 
in calendar  asia pacific equipment spending is expected to approach us spending  and as forecasted by industry analysts  to exceed the us in equipment spending by fsi anticipates many challenges as industry conditions continue to change with fabless environments and demands for integrated processes from its customers continue to increase 
results of operations fiscal was a difficult year as fsi saw its revenue decrease from fiscal in anticipation of lower revenue  fsi implemented cost reduction measures in october  including an involuntary reduction in force  scheduled plant shutdowns and the delay or cancellation of certain programs 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  fsi incurred million of charges relating to the realignment of its business due to industry conditions and the length of the industry downturn 
these charges were the result of the reduction in force and related severance costs  additional inventory reserves due to the discontinuation or phasing out of certain product lines  increased allowance for doubtful accounts for customers who previously purchased products which may be impacted by the realignment and charges related to the consolidation of facilities 
see note of the consolidated financial statements the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain income and expense items as a percent of total sales percent of sales  fiscal years ended sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating loss other income  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense equity in earnings losses of affiliates net loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net loss income from discontinued operations gain on sale of net assets of discontinued operations net loss income sales sales decreased to million for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  the decrease in sales occurred in both the microlithography and surface conditioning product lines 
the overall decrease in sales is a result of limited capital expenditures by fsi s customers due to fewer new fabs being constructed and equipped  and a limited number of fab expansions by fsi s customers 
sales decreased slightly to million for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  the decrease in sales occurred in the microlithography product lines as a result of industry conditions 
international sales were million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  and represented approximately  and of sales during these periods 
the decrease in international sales in fiscal occurred in all international markets  particularly japan 
due to its broader customer base  the surface conditioning division has a higher percentage of international sales than the microlithography division 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s international sales 
fsi ended the fiscal year with a backlog of approximately million as compared to million at the end of fiscal backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer purchase order has been received or a customer purchase order number has been communicated in writing to fsi 
because of the timing and relative size of orders and the possibility of cancellations or customer delays  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for future periods 
our book to bill ratio for the fourth quarter of fiscal was and was for the full fiscal year 
orders  net of cancellations  in the second half of fiscal were approximately million as compared to approximately million during the first half  reflecting the improving industry conditions 
fsi expects an increase in the amount of orders for the first quarter of fiscal as compared with the fourth quarter of based upon current backlog  anticipated orders  and delivery schedules  fsi expects fiscal sales to be above the fiscal level 
gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of sales for fiscal  was as compared to approximately for fiscal the decrease in gross margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to fixed excess manufacturing capacity related costs spread over a lower sales level 
gross profit  as a percentage of sales for fiscal  was as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal was generally due to increased inventory write offs  product mix  and increased warranty and obsolescence costs 
gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was significantly reduced due to approximately million of additional inventory reserves and severance and outplacement costs associated with a reduction in force 
due to the industry conditions and fsi s realignment  both divisions reviewed their phase out plans and discontinued products 
as a result  the divisions increased their inventory reserves 
the total net increase in inventory reserves for fiscal was approximately  as compared to a net increase of  in fiscal and a net increase of  in the larger net amounts in and were due to the continued downturn in the industry 
in the past  industry cycles were shorter and inventory levels were managed to phase out plans and product discontinuances 
fsi s gross profit margin may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the mix of products sold as some products have higher margins than others  the proportion of international sales as international sales generally have lower margins  competitive pricing pressures and utilization of manufacturing capacity 
it is anticipated that gross margins as a percent of sales will be in the mid range in fiscal cost reduction programs currently under way at the company  if successful  could result in higher margins in the latter half of fiscal as compared to the first half of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal were million or of sales  as compared to million or of sales in fiscal and million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is due to the overall reduction in force and also due to approximately million of realignment charges in as discussed below 
the dollar and percentage increase in sg a in fiscal as compared to is due to one time charges of approximately million 
the million of charges consists of million of costs associated with organizational changes announced in december and the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit  million of costs associated with facilities consolidation   of costs associated with increased allowance for doubtful accounts and  of severance costs and outplacement fees related to the reduction in force 
in addition  the increase in the amount of sg a expenses in fiscal was also due to costs associated with information systems  year programs and overall infrastructure costs 
fsi expects the dollar amount of sg a expenses to increase in fiscal primarily because of goodwill associated with the recent acquisition of yieldup international  inc  the sap system operating and support costs and other sg a costs 
also  fsi will continue investments to expand worldwide sales and support capability 
fsi expects sg a expenses to be up slightly in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal however  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal fsi expects to have a decrease in sg a expense as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal and million  or of sales  for fiscal fsi s average investment on new product and process development programs as a percent of total revenues has been for the past three years 
fsi expects r d expense as a percentage of sales to decrease in fiscal as compared to however  the dollar amount is expected to increase 
fsi will continue to remain focused on critical technologies and strategically invest our r d dollars  specifically in the immersion technology for surface conditioning products  the calypso spin on dielectric product  and mm products for both resist processing and surface conditioning 
fsi expects r d expenses to decrease in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of also  fsi will incur an in process r d write off of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal related to the yieldup acquisition 
during fiscal years  and  fsi recognized approximately   and  respectively  of third party funding as reductions in research and development expenses 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was approximately  of income  or of sales  for fiscal as compared to million of income  or of sales  for fiscal and million of income  or of sales for fiscal the overall change for fiscal as compared to is due to an additional expense of approximately  associated with the make whole penalties related to the repayment of certain senior unsecured notes scheduled to mature through the decrease for fiscal as compared to was due to increased interest expense as a result of the million private debt placement completed in december interest expense is expected to be minimal for fsi in fiscal year interest income is expected to be  to  per quarter  depending upon the level of investments and the interest rates 
income tax benefit expense the tax expense related to continuing operations for fiscal was million of expense as compared to a million of tax benefit for the comparable period 
during the third quarter of  fsi recorded a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance was recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 primarily due to fsi s continued losses 
the income tax benefit from continuing operations for fiscal was approximately million compared to million of tax benefit for fiscal the increase in tax benefit for fiscal was due to larger operating losses 
fsi does not expect to record any tax benefit or expense in the future until the company is consistently profitable on a quarterly basis 
fsi s deferred tax assets on the balance sheet as of august  have been fully reserved with a valuation allowance 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates equity in earnings losses of affiliates was approximately million of losses for fiscal   of income for fiscal and million of income for fiscal the loss in fiscal and the decrease in income in as compared to fiscal is due to losses or lower earnings at both affiliates  metron technology bv and m fsi ltd 
fsi is expecting improved financial performance for metron technology in fiscal in late september  metron technology filed an s document with the sec for an initial public offering ipo 
metron plans to use the proceeds from the ipo for working capital and general corporate purposes 
fsi expects to participate as a selling shareholder and anticipates that its post ipo ownership percentage will be slightly above percent 
the company expects that the improving financial performance of metron will be offset by losses of m fsi in fiscal liquidity and capital resources fsi s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately million as of august   an increase of million from the end of fiscal the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is due to cash proceeds of approximately million from the divestiture of the chemical management division offset by million of acquisitions of property  plant  and equipment  million in senior unsecured notes prepayments and the funding of operating losses 
on september   fsi completed the repayment of its senior unsecured notes 
the notes consisted of million of senior unsecured notes due to mature in which were paid off in september and million of senior unsecured notes due to mature in which were paid off prior to year end fiscal at the time of the prepayment  certain lenders had claimed that fsi was in default under certain covenants contained in the note agreements 
these claims were waived in connection with the repayment 
fsi s long term debt  including current maturities  remaining after the pay off of its unsecured notes is approximately  related to capital leases 
accounts receivable decreased million from the end of fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable was mainly due to the decrease in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal however  accounts receivable did not decrease as much as would be expected given the year over year sales decrease because fourth quarter sales increased over fourth quarter sales 
inventory decreased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal this was mainly due to decreases in raw materials and work in process and a net increase in the inventory reserves of  offset by an increase in finished products 
as of august   fsi s current ratio was to and working capital was million 
acquisitions of property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fsi expects capital expenditures to be between and million in fiscal fsi believes that with existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and internally generated funds  there will be sufficient funds to meet fsi s currently projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least mid fiscal 
fsi believes that success in its industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
fsi may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  consider divestitures  investments or acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
fsi may affect additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to fsi s shareholders 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes appropriate accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
must be adopted for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  it is anticipated that fsi will adopt sfas no 
in fiscal the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on fsi s financial statements 
risk factors due to the nature of business and the industry in which we operate  the following risk factors should be considered in addition to others described above 
because our business depends on the amount that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment  downturns in the microelectronics industry may adversely affect our results the microelectronics industry experiences periodic slowdowns  which may have a negative effect on our sales and operating results 
for example  in fiscal  before the current industry slowdown  we reported net income from continuing operations of million 
in contrast  in fiscal  we reported a net loss from continuing operations of million 
our business depends on the amount that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment 
the amount they spend on capital equipment depends on the existing and expected demand for semiconductor devices and products that use semiconductor devices 
the microelectronics industry has experienced alternating upturns and downturns in business activity 
some semiconductor manufacturers have experienced lower demand and increased pricing pressure for their products 
as a result  they have purchased less semiconductor processing equipment and have sometimes delayed making decisions to purchase capital equipment 
in some cases  semiconductor manufacturers have cancelled or delayed orders for our products 
if we do not continue to develop new products  we will not be able to compete effectively our business and results of operations could decline if we do not develop and successfully introduce new or improved products that the market accepts 
the technology used in microelectronics manufacturing equipment and processes changes rapidly 
industry standards change constantly and equipment manufacturers frequently introduce new products 
we believe that microelectronics manufacturers increasingly rely on equipment manufacturers like us to design and develop more efficient manufacturing equipment design and implement improved processes for microelectronics manufacturers to use make their equipment compatible with equipment made by other equipment manufacturers to compete  we must continue to develop  manufacture  and market new or improved products that meet changing industry standards 
to do this successfully  we must select appropriate products design and develop our products efficiently and quickly implement our manufacturing and assembly processes efficiently and on time make products that perform well for our customers market and sell our products effectively introduce our new products in a way that does not reduce sales of our existing products if we cannot effectively integrate yieldup s operations  then potential benefits of the merger may not be realized 
we will have to integrate yieldup s manufacturing  research and development  and sales and marketing efforts 
if we are not successful in this integration  then our results of operations could be adversely affected  employee morale could decline  and key employees could leave 
in addition  until yieldup s existing customers have had the opportunity to determine how well the combined organization operates  they may cancel existing orders or delay placing new ones 
future acquisitions may dilute our stockholders ownership interests and have other adverse consequences because of consolidations in the semiconductor equipment industry served by us and other competitive factors  our management will seek to acquire additional product lines  technologies  and businesses if suitable opportunities develop 
acquisitions may result in the issuance of our stock  which may dilute our stockholders ownership interests and reduce earnings per share 
acquisitions may also increase debt levels and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in absorbing the new business  product line  or technology diversion of management s attention from other business concerns entering new markets in which we have little or no experience possible loss of key employees of the acquired business because of the current industry slowdown  costs associated with our idle facilities have increased as a percent of sales while revenues have decreased as a result of the current industry slowdown  we are not currently able to fully utilize the new manufacturing facilities we added in the last several years 
these additional facilities and related costs have increased our overall operating expenses 
these higher expenses  together with lower revenues caused by the industry slowdown  are having a negative effect on our gross profit margins 
this negative effect will continue until we are able to increase our use of our facilities 
because of the volatility of our stock price  your ability to trade fsi shares may be adversely affected and our ability to raise capital through future equity financings may be reduced the price of our stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be so in the future 
in the fiscal year  for example  our stock price ranged from to per share 
the reasons for this volatility include variations in our actual or anticipated financial results from quarter to quarter announcements made by us  our competitors  or our customers government regulations industry developments general market conditions the prices of technology stocks  including ours  have been particularly affected by extreme fluctuations in price and volume in the stock market generally 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stock is traded 
these broad stock market fluctuations may have a negative effect on our future stock price 
because our quarterly operating results are volatile  our stock price could decrease in the past  our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations may have a significant impact on our stock price 
the reasons for the fluctuations in our operating results  such as sales  gross profits  and net income  include economic conditions in the microelectronics industry financial results of our affiliates a large portion of revenues being generated by a small number of sales timing of orders placed by major customers competitive pricing pressures the proportion of total sales made up by international sales product modifications requested by customers product mix and performance because international sales are important to us  and because most of our international sales are through our affiliated distributors  reductions in the sales efforts of these affiliates could adversely affect our results the profits or losses of our affiliated distributors  metron technology bv and m fsi ltd  can also significantly affect our financial results 
we make most of our international sales through these affiliated distributors 
as of the end of fiscal  we have a ownership interest in metron and a interest in m fsi 
fiscal sales through m fsi were million or of our total sales 
fiscal sales through metron were million or of our total sales 
in addition  these affiliates also provide service and support to many of our international customers 
metron and m fsi also distribute or sell products for companies other than us 
it could have a negative effect on our operating results if either of these affiliates reduced its sales efforts  lost the business of a significant company for which it distributes or sells products  or otherwise became less financially viable 
we cannot guarantee that metron or m fsi will continue to successfully distribute our products or the products of other companies 
the failure of metron or m fsi to do so could have a significant negative effect on our results of operations 
changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may reduce our international sales almost all of our direct international sales are denominated in us dollars 
nonetheless  changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect our international sales 
most of our international sales  however  are through our affiliated distributors 
metron s sales of our products and other companies products are primarily denominated in us dollars  but its expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect metron s financial results 
m fsi sales are denominated in yen 
as a result  us dollar yen exchange rates may affect our equity interest in m fsi s earnings 
metron and m fsi sometimes engage in so called hedging or risk reducing transactions to try to limit the negative effects that the devaluation of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could have on operating results 
they will do so if a sale denominated in a foreign currency is sufficiently large to justify the costs of hedging 
to hedge a sale  metron or m fsi will typically commit to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at a given price at a future date 
if the customer cancels the sale  metron or m fsi may be forced to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at market rates to meet its hedging obligations and may incur a loss in doing so 
to date  the hedging activities of metron and m fsi have not had any significant negative effect on us 
because of the need to meet and comply with numerous foreign regulations and policies  the changeability of the political and economic environments in foreign jurisdictions and the difficulty of managing business overseas  we may not be able to sustain our historical level of international sales we and our affiliates operate in a global market 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
in fiscal  this figure was  and in fiscal it was 
these figures include sales through metron and m fsi  which accounted for of international sales in  in  and in we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total sales 
sales to customers outside the united states involve a number of risks  including the following imposition of government controls compliance with us export laws and foreign laws political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in taxes and tariffs longer payment cycles difficulty of administering business overseas general economic conditions in particular  the japanese and asia pacific markets are extremely competitive 
the semiconductor device manufacturers located there are very aggressive in seeking price concessions from suppliers  including equipment manufacturers like us 
in fiscal  approximately of our international sales were attributable to these markets 
total sales to these markets have declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we seek to meet technical standards imposed by foreign regulatory bodies 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with those standards in the future 
any failure by us to design products to comply with foreign standards could have a significant negative impact on us 
because of the significant financial resources needed to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support and to invest in research and development  we may be unable to compete with larger  better established competitors the microelectronics equipment industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition throughout the world 
we believe that to remain competitive  we will need significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support  and to invest in research and development 
we believe that the microelectronics industry is becoming increasingly dominated by large manufacturers who have the resources to support customers on a worldwide basis 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and customer support capabilities than us 
large equipment manufacturers may enter the market areas in which we compete 
in addition  smaller  emerging microelectronics equipment companies provide innovative technology 
we expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes 
we also expect them to introduce new products and processes with better performance and pricing 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to compete effectively in the united states or elsewhere 
because we do not have long term sales commitments with our customers  if these customers decide to reduce  delay or cancel orders or choose to deal with our competitors  then our results will be adversely affected if our significant customers  including ibm  texas instruments  or national semiconductor  reduce  delay  or cancel orders  then our operating results will suffer 
our largest customers have changed from year to year 
sales to fsi s top five customers accounted for approximately  and of total sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
ibm accounted for more than of revenue during each of the last three years  representing in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal texas instruments accounted for of revenues during fiscal national semiconductor accounted for and of revenues in fiscal and we currently have no long term sales commitments with any of our customers 
instead  we generally make sales under purchase orders 
because we retained certain liabilities from the divestiture of the chemical management division or agreed to indemnify boc with respect to specified obligations and liabilities  we may experience charges in excess of the reserves established at the time of the divestiture which could negatively impact results from operations in connection with the divestiture of the chemical management division  we retained certain liabilities and agreed to indemnify boc with respect to certain specified obligations and liabilities 
in addition  the purchase price is subject to adjustment based upon the closing statement of net assets 
we have prepared the closing statement  but boc has raised certain objections to it 
the parties are undertaking to resolve those objections and come to an agreement regarding any necessary purchase price adjustments 
that closing statement has not yet been agreed to by the parties 
at the time of the divestiture  we recorded reserves for known liabilities 
if we experience liabilities or charges in excess of established reserves or the parties disagree or are unable to resolve the differences with respect to the closing statement of net assets and it is ultimately determined that an adjustment in favor of boc is warranted  our results of operations could be adversely impacted due to additional costs associated with those reserves or the request to return to boc a portion of the purchase price because of such adjustments 
it may be difficult for us to compete with stronger competitors resulting from industry consolidation we believe that industry consolidation may result in competitors that are better able to compete 
this could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in the past several years  we have seen a trend toward consolidation in the microelectronics equipment industry 
we expect the trend toward consolidation to continue as companies seek to strengthen or maintain their market positions in a rapidly changing industry 
because we depend upon our management and technical personnel for our success  the loss of key personnel could place us at a competitive disadvantage our success depends to a significant extent upon our management and technical personnel 
the loss of a number of these key persons could have a negative effect on our operations 
competition is high for such personnel in our industry in all locations 
we periodically review our compensation and benefit packages to ensure that they are competitive in the marketplace and make adjustments or implement new programs for that purpose  as appropriate 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we require to continue to grow and operate profitably 
because our intellectual property is important to our success  the loss or diminution of our intellectual property rights through legal challenge by others or from independent development by others  could adversely affect our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  and other measures 
however  we believe that our financial performance will depend more upon the innovation  technological expertise  and marketing abilities of our employees than on such protection 
in connection with our intellectual property rights  we face the following risks our pending patent applications may not be issued or may be issued with more narrow claims patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented rights granted under issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us foreign laws may not protect our intellectual property rights others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products  or design around our patents as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we occasionally receive notices from others alleging infringement claims 
we have been involved in patent infringement litigation in the past and scd mountain view is currently involved in such litigation 
we could become involved in similar lawsuits or other patent infringement claims in the future 
we cannot guarantee the outcome of such lawsuits or claims  which may have a significant negative effect on our business or operating results 
if we and or our third party vendors are not year compliant  then we may be incapable of conducting business we are addressing the issues associated with date related data and the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
we are aware of the computing difficulties that the millennium issue presents for the year we have identified teams to address the information technology it systems used for internal purposes at fsi and to also address the non it systems used by us 
each of our divisions have also identified teams to address the potential software and hardware issues associated with the division s individual product lines 
it is anticipated that all reprogramming and year testing efforts for internally used information technology it systems will be complete by the end of november the non it systems generally require third party assurances as to compliance with year to date  confirmations have not been received from all of our vendors indicating that plans are being developed to address processing of transactions in the year availability of resources  unexpected delays as well as coding issues may impact our ability to complete the reprogramming by the end of november or of our vendors ability to become year compliant 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal operating systems  which are composed predominantly of third party software and hardware technology or by the inability of vendors to correct their year issues 
in the worst case  we or the third parties on which we depend may  for an extended period of time  be incapable of conducting critical business activities  such as manufacturing and shipping products and invoicing customers 
in addition  if public suppliers of water  electricity  or natural gas are disrupted for a substantial period  our operations may be materially adversely affected 
each of the divisions have completed the analysis of each of their product lines to determine if hardware and software are year compliant and if necessary  determined and began the implementation of the appropriate fixes 
our current standard product lines are believed to be year compliant 
we are working with our customers to schedule appropriate upgrades and necessary servicing of products 
there can be no assurance that our current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to the company  including repair and replacement costs and costs incurred in litigation due to any such defects 
many commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  and our current lack of knowledge as to whether our products are year compliant  there can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected by claims related to year compliance 
we incurred approximately  to address the year problem during and expect to incur approximately  in fiscal 
we have completed a contingency plan if our it and non it systems are not year compliant 
adoption of the common european currency may adversely affect us and our affiliated distributors by requiring systems modifications and possibly increasing their currency exchange risks we are in the process of analyzing the issues raised by the introduction of the common european currency unit  the euro 
the use of the euro began on january  and will be phased in through january  we do not expect the cost of any necessary systems modification to be material and do not anticipate that the introduction and use of the euro will materially affect our results or those of our affiliated distributors international business operations 
nor do we expect the euro to have a material effect on the currency exchange risks of our or our affiliated distributors businesses 
our management will continue to monitor the effect of the implementation of the euro 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates due to investments in foreign based affiliates 
our investments in affiliates includes a interest in metron technology metron and a interest in m fsi ltd 
metron operates mainly in europe  asia pacific and the united states 
m fsi ltd 
operates in japan 
approximately of fiscal sales to affiliates were to metron 
we denominate all us export sales in us dollars 
metron attempts to limit its exposure to changing foreign currency exchange rates through operational and financial market actions 
products are sold in a number of countries throughout the world resulting in a diverse portfolio of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
certain short term foreign currency exposures are managed by the purchase of forward contracts to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates as all material outstanding debt was repaid on september  and all marketable securities consist of debt instruments  of which mature within one year 
all marketable securities mature within two years 
as of year end  amortized cost approximates market value for all outstanding marketable securities 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions
