this data is unaudited and includes  in the opinion of the company s management  all adjustments necessary to present fairly the data in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

as of december   the components of cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments were cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  short term marketable investments of million and long term marketable investments of approximately million 
such marketable investments consisted principally of high grade fixed income securities  with a maturity of less than two years 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  totaled approximately million at december   an increase of approximately million from december   or 
this increase is attributable to an increase in accrued therapeutics revenue of million  and increased diagnostics receivables of million offset by a like increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the company s average number of days sales in net diagnostics receivables was approximately compared to approximately at december  this decline is principally due to the increased allowance for doubtful accounts 
virtually all of the company s diagnostic services are rendered on a fee for service basis 
accordingly  the company assumes the financial risk related to collection  including potential uncollectability of accounts  long collection cycles for accounts receivable  difficulties in gathering complete and accurate billing information and delays attendant to reimbursement by third party payors  such as governmental programs  private insurance plans and managed care organizations 
the company monitors the collection quality of its accounts receivable through analytical review of aging categories by payor group and collections performance 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded a special charge of million to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts in respect of certain accounts for which the company determined that the cost of additional collection efforts would exceed the expected collections 
in addition  in  the company determined that due to oversights in the implementation and administration of certain marketing arrangements  the company did not send invoices timely to certain patients  primarily managed care patients  for certain co pay  deductible and other amounts relating principally to services rendered in in december  the company commenced collection efforts for certain of these amounts 
the company has taken steps to implement systems and processing changes intended to improve its billing procedures and related collection results  including actions taken in respect to the oversights determined in while the company maintains what it believes to be an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts  there can be no assurance that the company s ongoing assessment of accounts receivable will not result in the need for additional provision for doubtful accounts 
such additional provision could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company believes that the potential patient and client reaction as a result of the company s delay in sending invoices to patients for the co pay  deductible and other amounts determined in  could result in some of the urologists for such patients discontinuing or reducing their use of the company s diagnostic services 
the loss of any of such clients business could adversely affect the rate of the company s growth in revenues and the company s results of operations

of the total amount  approximately million related to internal software development costs for information services 
while future capital expenditures will depend upon a number of factors  the level of expenditures is expected to be higher than the historical level of such expenditures as the company expands to deliver therapeutics and information services and continues to enhance current diagnostic services and operational capabilities 
the company intends to finance the majority of these capital expenditures with existing cash and investment balances 
in  the company expects to relocate to a new building  which is currently being constructed adjacent to the company s existing facilities 
the company has committed to funding a portion of the building tenant improvements and expects to spend in excess of million beginning in the first quarter for such improvements and other capital expenditures related to moving to the new building 
the company intends to finance the majority of these capital expenditures with existing cash and investment balances 
in october  the company entered into a co promotion agreement with the manufacturer of two therapeutic products pursuant to which  for the year ended december   the company recorded revenue of approximately million 
pursuant to this agreement  the company recognized revenue when earned based primarily on the attainment of mutually agreed upon sales goals 
pursuant to a revised agreement entered into between the parties that became effective january   the company s compensation is based primarily upon sales calls completed by the company with a potential bonus if certain sales goals are attained 
since the criteria for determining the company s compensation differs under the current agreement from the original agreement  the company does not believe that revenues recorded for prior periods under the original agreement will be indicative of future revenues under the current agreement  and the company currently anticipates that it will not attain the same level of revenues under the current agreement that it attained under the original agreement in the current agreement also is subject to termination upon the occurrence of certain events or by either party in its discretion giving the other party prior notice of days of termination without cause on or after september  in december  the company obtained distribution rights to a therapeutic product currently under review for marketing approval by the fda 
prior to  the company made aggregate milestone payments of million 
the company is obligated to pay an additional milestone payment of million if and when the product is approved by the fda for marketing in the united states 
if the company is required to make this payment  it intends to do so from existing cash and investment balances 
the company may terminate this agreement at any time prior to fda approval of the product and recoup the equivalent of payments already made 
during  the company obtained marketing and other rights to two other therapeutic products  and is obligated to pay up to  to the manufacturers based on achievement of certain milestones 
if the company is required to make these payments  it intends to do so from existing cash and investment balances 
the company paid current income taxes of approximately  during at december   the company estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million were available to reduce future taxable income after considering certain annual limitations 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to provide the funds necessary to maintain its present level of operations and implement its currently planned growth strategy 
however  there may be circumstances or new business opportunities that would require additional resources 
in such event  the company may be required to seek additional financing  and there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms 
impact of year issue the year issue is the result of computer programming being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s systems  as well as those of key vendors  payors and customers  that have date sensitive logic may interpret a date using as the year rather than this may result in inaccurate processing or possible system failure causing potential disruption of operations  including among other things a temporary inability to process transactions  send bills for services or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has implemented a year program to address its current information systems  desktop systems  laboratory equipment and infrastructures 
the program also addresses the year readiness of key vendors and suppliers  corporate partners  governmental agencies  banks and key customers and clients 
the program is being administered by an internal task force and consists of the following phases phase is the compilation of an inventory of systems and relationships with suppliers  key customers and other business partners 
this phase is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of phase is the final assessment of each item identified in the inventory  verification of each item s compliance with year requirements and a resulting financial risk analysis 
anticipated completion for this phase is the second quarter of phase is the resolution of any issues identified in phase and the development of a contingency plan to deal with internal and external risks associated with the year issue 
it is anticipated that this phase will be complete by the end of the third quarter of in  urocor s initial assessment of its internal computer systems and related applications indicated that these systems and applications are prepared to accommodate date sensitive information relating to the year issue 
urocor expects that any additional costs related to ensuring such systems to be year compliant will not be material to the financial condition or results of operations of the company and to fund such costs through existing working capital and operating cash flows 
the company estimates that the total future expenditures specifically relating to the year project will be less than  however  there is no assurance that a complete review will not identify additional costs and efforts that will be required and could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations 
additionally  the ability of third parties with whom urocor transacts business to address their year issues adequately is outside the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the failure of such third parties to identify and address their respective year issues adequately will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the most significant exposure is to the federal government s medicare and medicaid programs and with major insurance companies 
these customer in aggregate represent a material portion of the company s revenue and corresponding cash flow 
as to supplier and vendors  the most significant are those associated with services and products supply and distribution 
to date  the company is not aware of any problems that would materially impact results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
as the ability of these third parties to address their year issues adequately is outside the company s control  there can be no assurance that the failure of third parties to address their respective year issues adequately will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the company s risk analysis which will be completed as a part of phase  the company will develop a contingency plan in the event that it is unable to achieve year readiness of its critical operations 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion of its year efforts no later than june  and determine whether a contingency plan is necessary 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to develop contingency plans that will adequately address all year issues that may arise
