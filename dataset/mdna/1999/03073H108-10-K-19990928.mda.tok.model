item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general elk s principal activity is making small and medium sized business loans as permitted under the act 
historically  elk s earnings have been derived primarily from net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets consisting of small and medium size business loans  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities consisting of indebtedness to elk s banks and subordinated debentures issued to the sba 
net interest income is a function of the net interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to interest bearing liabilities 
unrealized depreciation on loans and investments is recorded when elk adjusts the value of a loan to reflect management s estimate of the fair value  as approved by the board of directors 
see note of notes to the financial statements 
results of operations results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income elk s investment income increased  to  for the year ended june   when compared with the year ended june  the increase was due to an increase in interest earned on the loan portfolio  off set by a decrease in other fees and income 
this reflects elk s decision to maximize stockholders return by maximizing the use of bank financing 
operating expenses interest expenses increased  to  when compared with the prior year due to elk s strategy to maximize bank financing which rose to  as of june   as compared to  at june  other operating expenses increased to  for the year ended june   as compared with  in the prior year 
bad debt expense decreased  to  during the year ended june   as compared with the year ended june  net income net income for the year ended june   increased  to  when compared with the year ended june  the increase reflects the benefit of elk s decision to maximize the use of leverage on bank financing 
results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income elk s investment income for the fiscal year ended june  increased to  from  or  when compared with the year ended june  this increase was mainly due to an increase in its loan portfolio 
the portfolio increased from  as of june  to  as of june   as part of our strategy to maximize stockholder rate of return primarily through the utilization of bank financing 
operating expenses interest expense for the year ended june  increased to  as compared to  for the similar period ended june  this increase was mainly due to increased bank borrowings of  as of june   compared to  as of june  other operating expenses increased  when compared with the year ended june  this increase was mainly due to a  increase in bad debt expense  in addition to various increases in the administrative fees 
net income net income for the year ended june   decreased  as compared to the year ended june  this decrease was mainly caused by an increase in the bad debt expense of  balance sheet and reserves total assets increased by  as of june  as compared to june  this increase was due to management s decision to expand its portfolio in the chicago taxi medallion market plus increases in the diversified loan portfolio 
this expansion was financed by an increase in bank debt of  during the fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources to date  elk has funded its operations through private placements of its securities  bank financing  and the issuance to the sba of its subordinated debentures 
in  elk agreed to repurchase all of the  outstanding shares of its preferred stock from the sba for an aggregate price of  representing a discount of from the original issue price of per share 
as a condition of the repurchase  elk granted the sba a liquidating interest in a newly established restricted capital surplus account the restricted capital account 
the restricted capital account is equal to the amount of the net repurchase discount in which the sba received a liquidating interest  amortized over months ending november  however  if elk is liquidated or if a material violation of sba regulations occurs during the amortization period  the sba would receive the remaining unamortized amount of the restricted capital account prior to the stockholders of elk receiving any amounts on their common stock 
the unamortized balance of the sba s liquidating interest at june  was  in december and september elk raised additional capital of  and  respectively  less private placement costs of  and  respectively 
these proceeds were used to repurchase elk s preferred stock from the sba 
in connection with the purchase  all dividends in arrears on the preferred stock were extinguished 
during january  elk completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share for aggregate gross proceeds of  less offering expenses of  the net proceeds were utilized to repay bank indebtedness and for working capital 
a portion of the proceeds temporarily used to reduce bank indebtedness  up to a maximum of  were allocated by elk toward the organization and capitalization of its new parent company  ameritrans 
at june   of elk s indebtedness was represented by indebtedness to its banks and by the debentures issued to the sba with fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
elk currently may borrow up to  under its existing lines of credit  subject to the limitations imposed by its borrowing base agreement with its banks and the sba  the statutory and regulatory limitations imposed by the sba  and the availability of funds 
during september  elk s banks collectively approved an increase of the credit lines to an aggregate of  in addition  elk is presently eligible to apply for additional leverage from the sba if it is determined by the board of directors to be in the best interests of elk 
no assurance can be given that  if applied for  such additional financing will be approved by the sba 
loan amortization and prepayments also provide a source of funding for elk 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
because elk distributes at least of its investment company taxable income and if the share exchange is completed  ameritrans will do likewise  we will continue to rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
in order to provide the funds necessary for our expansion strategy  we expect to raise additional capital and to incur  from time to time  additional bank indebtedness and if deemed necessary by management to obtain sba loans 
there can be no assurances that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms 
year compliance we have been taking steps to address and prevent problems in connection with the year year 
such problems are expected to occur due to the inability of computer systems to properly recognize and process date sensitive information relating to the year and beyond 
year issues may affect our information technology systems it and non information technology systems non it 
the following are the it systems that we use o we use a computer program to track our receivable loans loan track 
to address year  in february we engaged the consultant who originally developed loan track for us  to test  upgrade and certify loan track as year compliant 
the consultant completed all of such tasks  and the year compliant loan track program is now in use in our regular operations 
we also use the standard peachtree tm accounting system for general in house accounting functions 
the version of peachtree we currently use has been upgraded to be year compliant 
o we also use other industry wide programs such as windows and word perfect 
it is expected that either the current versions are year compliant or that year compliant upgrade versions have been obtained or will be obtained prior to december in addition  during the past months and at present  we have been replacing or upgrading our computer hardware with equipment that will be year compliant 
non it systems have been defined as embedded technology  such as micro controllers  that may be included in elevators and other equipment and machinery 
most of our non it systems consist of office equipment 
we have inventoried our non it systems  and we are in the process of contacting our office equipment and telecommunications suppliers and landlord to determine the status of their year readiness 
we do not believe that we face material year issues with respect to our non it systems 
costs in connection with year compliance have been i to review and upgrade existing it systems  ii to analyze year readiness of our banks and customers and iii to analyze non it year compliance 
to date  such costs have aggregated approximately  and  for the most part  have been for it review and upgrades 
such costs are being treated as expenses 
during june and july  we replaced certain hardware and purchased additional software and communications systems at a cost of approximately  and the cost of such replacements are being capitalized and depreciated over a five year period 
we do not believe that other costs associated with year compliance will be material or that they will have a material effect on our financial condition 
we are dependent on banks for financing and for normal banking operations 
in surveying year readiness  we have received oral  and we are in the process of obtaining written  assurances from our banks that they are taking the actions necessary to be year compliant so that neither the banks nor their customers business will be interrupted due to year difficulties 
our portfolio companies are taxi and taxi medallion owners and other small businesses  which  to the best of our knowledge  use computer equipment and software only to a limited extent in the operation of their businesses 
we are in the process of surveying certain of our vendors to assess their potential year exposure and to confirm that they are making arrangements for their own year compliance 
to date we have attempted to comply fully with year compliance requirements  and we are in the process of determining the compliance of our banks and customers 
our failure  or the failure of third parties  to adequately address year issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  given the nature of our portfolio companies and the industries in which they operate  we anticipate that few of our customers would actually suffer material adverse effects from year we believe that our reasonably likely maximum risk is i a material increase in our credit losses due to year problems affecting our portfolio companies and our banks and ii disruption in financial markets  causing us liquidity stress 
at this point  our management is unable to quantify the amount of potential losses and disruptions due to year issues  but is in the process of developing a contingency plan
