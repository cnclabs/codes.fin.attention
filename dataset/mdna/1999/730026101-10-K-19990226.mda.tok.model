item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared with sales increased for the eighth consecutive year  as sales at million were up from levels 
the major contributor was brite line technologies  where sales increased by million from last year  reflecting increased business from both new and existing customers 
sales in plymouth s tape business produced in canton  mass  and porrino  spain decreased by million and  primarily because of capacity constraints  product mix  and because of reduced demand due to the general motors strike 
gross margin increased to from last year 
in plymouth s tape business  gross margin improved to from last year 
the primary factor was lower product costs  resulting from lower purchase costs for resin and other raw materials  and lower manufacturing spending  offset in part by higher unfavorable volume variances 
gross margin at brite line decreased to from last year  reflecting higher production costs and an increase in inventory reserves  offset in part by favorable manufacturing overhead absorption from higher production levels  and by favorable product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from last year 
the major contributing factors were lower warehouse handling charges  advertising  freight and commissions in plymouth s tape business 
this was partially offset by higher accrued bonus  profit sharing  professional fees  and bad debt expense in plymouth s tape business  and higher professional fees at brite line 
interest expense  as a percentage of sales  increased to from last year 
higher interest expense resulted from an increase in current and long term debt to million from million last year  in order to finance capital equipment purchases 
in addition  the revolving line of credit increased to million at november  from million last year  in order to finance higher accounts receivable  resulting from a million sales increase in the fourth quarter of from the same period in  some capital equipment purchases  and a small increase in inventory 
as a result of the above factors  income before tax increased to million in from million last year 
the effective tax rate in decreased to from last year  resulting from investment tax credits generated by the more than million of capital equipment placed in service during the year 
as a result  net income increased to million from million last year 
the company generated million of operating cash flow in this operating cash flow and cash provided through additional borrowings totaling million under the company s line of credit  a refinancing of capital equipment and a capital expenditure line of credit of million  and the sale leaseback of plant assets of million  were used to pay off or reduce term debt and capital leases of million and to finance capital expenditures of million 
the us dollar is the functional currency for the company s brite line and canton operations 
for these operations  all gains and losses from currency transactions are included in income currently 
the company operates a wholly owned subsidiary in spain which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal the functional currency of this subsidiary is the peseta 
changes in the peseta exchange rate could affect the reporting of the subsidiary s earnings in the consolidated statement of operations 
from time to time  the us company enters into purchase or sales contracts in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s practice is to hedge those transactions which are of significant size 
environmental proceedings 
claims under cercla the company has been named as a potentially responsible party prp by the united states environmental protection agency epa in two ongoing claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
these cercla claims involve attempts by the epa to recover the costs associated with the cleanup of two superfund sites in southington  connecticut the solvent recovery service of new england superfund site srs site and the old southington landfill superfund site osl site 
srs was an independent and licensed solvent recycler disposal company 
the epa asserts that srs  after receiving and processing various hazardous substances from prp s  shipped some resultant sludges and wastewater from the srs site to the osl site 
the company received a prp notification regarding the srs site in june  the epa originally attributed a share of the aggregate waste volume at the srs site to the company 
remedial action is ongoing at the site  and the company is a participant in the performing prp group 
largely because of orphaned shares  the company recently has been contributing approximately toward the performing prp group s expenses 
based upon the investigations and remedial actions conducted at the site to date  including the recently completed phytoremediation study  it is presently estimated that the total cost of the cleanup at the site will range from approximately million to million 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of november   management has accrued  as a reserve in this matter which is net of approximately  in payments made to date by the company 
the company received a prp notification regarding the osl site in january  in addition to numerous srs transshipper prp s such as the company  epa has named a number of other prp s who allegedly shipped waste materials directly to the osl site 
based on epa s asserted volume of shipments to srs  epa originally attributed of the srs transshipper prp s waste volume at the osl site to the company  which is an undetermined fraction of the total waste volume at the site 
a record of decision rod was issued in september  for the first phase of the cleanup and  in december   following mediation  the company contributed  toward a total contribution by the srs transshipper prp s of approximately million in full settlement of the first phase 
at present  neither the remedy for the second phase of the cleanup groundwater nor the allocation of the costs thereof among the prp s has been determined 
it has been estimated that the total costs of the second phase may range from million to million 
management has accrued  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a reserve against the company s potential future liability in this matter 
based on all available information as well as its prior experience  management believes that its accruals in these two matters are reasonable 
however  in each case the reserved amount is subject to adjustment for future developments that may arise from one or more of the following the long range nature of the case  legislative changes  insurance coverage  the joint and several liability provisions of cercla  the uncertainties associated with the ultimate groundwater remedy selected  and the company s ability to successfully negotiate an outcome similar to its previous experience in these matters 
claims under massachusetts general laws  chapter e while in the process of eliminating the use of underground storage tanks at the company s facility in canton  massachusetts  the company arranged for the testing of the areas adjacent to the tanks in question a set of five tanks in and a set of three tanks in the tests indicated that some localized soil contamination had occurred 
the company duly reported these findings regarding each location to the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep in and respectively  and dep issued notices of responsibility under massachusetts general laws chapter e to the company for each location rtn no 
and rtn no 
 respectively 
the company has retained an independent licensed site professional lsp to perform assessment and remediation work at the two locations 
with regard to the first matter involving the set of five tanks  the lsp has determined that the soil contamination appears to be confined to a small area and does not pose an environmental risk to surrounding property or community 
with regard to the second matter involving the set of three tanks  a limited amount of solvent has been found in the soil in the vicinity of the tanks  however  additional sampling is required 
it presently is estimated that the combined future costs to complete the assessment and remediation actions at the two locations will total approximately  and that amount has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements 
in january  the company received a chapter e notice of responsibility from dep concerning two sites located in dartmouth  massachusetts rtn no 
and freetown  massachusetts rtn no 
 respectively 
according to dep  drums containing oil and or hazardous materials were discovered at the two sites in  which led to some cleanup actions by the dep 
dep contends that an independent disposal firm allegedly hired by the company and other prp s  h m drum company  was responsible for disposing of drums at the two sites 
to date  the dep has issued notices of responsibility to approximately prp s 
a group of prp s  including the company  has retained an lsp to conduct groundwater investigations at both sites 
those investigations are still in progress  and until additional data is gathered  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the extent of the problem  the costs of any cleanup that may be required at either or both sites  or the company s potential share of liability or responsibility therefor 
accordingly  no reserve has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements with respect to these two sites 
other litigation the company s subsidiary  brite line technologies  inc  is both a defendant and a counterclaim plaintiff in a patent infringement lawsuit which was initiated in in federal district court in minnesota 
the suit involves contrasting claims by brite line and the plaintiff a competitor of brite line in the highway marking tapes business  that the other party has committed patent infringement with respect to its specialty retroreflective pavement marking tapes containing raised areas protrusions 
the particular brite line products in question  which were recently introduced to the market  are sold under the deltaline trademark 
brite line believes  upon advice of counsel  that it has not infringed the plaintiff s patents 
brite line is vigorously defending against the plaintiff s claims and is pursuing with equal vigor  its own patent infringement claims against the plaintiff 
the case is in the early stages of discovery  so it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the dollar amount  if any  that either party ultimately may recover from the other 
however  the plaintiff s sales of its challenged products have significantly exceeded plymouth s sales of deltaline products 
year computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors that use only two digits to identify a year in a data field may be unable to process accurately certain date based information at or after the year this is commonly referred to as the year issue  and the company has assembled a task force to oversee the entire year project  which includes the company s domestic and foreign tape business and brite line  for both information technology it and non it systems 
the company believes that its greatest potential risks are associated with its it systems and non it systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure 
the task force has identified five phases of the year compliance process for the company s it and non it systems 
these phases are issue identification  assessment  development of remediation plans  implementation and testing and contingency planning 
the first two phases have been completed as planned 
the company s year project is currently in the remediation phase and  with respect to its main information systems hardware and software  in the implementation and testing phase  which is complete 
with respect to it systems  the company s strategy is to upgrade some of the existing systems and replace others 
correction and testing of mission critical systems are targeted for completion by the end of the second quarter of fiscal with respect to non it systems  the implementation phase is complete 
large and critical suppliers were selected for compliance confirmation  to date of the responses have been received and no critical problems have been identified 
the company is following up with vendors yet to respond satisfactorily or at all to its inquiries 
separately  the company also is actively seeking information and assurances of a more technical nature from certain vendors regarding the compliance status of specific manufacturing and information processing equipment 
in addition to confirming compliance directly with suppliers and vendors  the company expects to perform its own testing of certain purchased equipment and it systems for compliance 
the company is monitoring the status of year compliance of its most significant customer by reviewing publicly available information 
compliance for all other customers is being determined through direct contact and written confirmation 
the company cannot provide assurance that the year compliance plans of its vendors and customers will be successfully completed in a timely manner 
the company has begun contingency planning and plans to complete its contingency planning for both it and non it systems  as appropriate  by the end of the second quarter of fiscal possible contingency plans include using alternate suppliers  outsourcing to third parties and reverting to manual processing of information 
once developed  contingency plans will continue to be reassessed and refined as additional information becomes available 
costs incurred to date for year have totaled approximately  and have been expensed as incurred 
the company currently estimates that total costs will approximate  including internal employee costs and costs of external consultants  and it currently plans to be able to fund the costs through operating cash flows 
the company does not expect a material adverse impact of such costs on its long term results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
cost estimates may be refined as remediation  testing and contingency planning continue and as compliance status information becomes available from third parties 
if the company were not taking any of the remedial steps detailed above  year issues would possibly cause significant technological problems for the company  disrupting business and resulting in a decline in earnings 
at this time  however  management does not believe that this will happen 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario should the company  its customers or suppliers be unable to adequately resolve year issues  would include a temporary slowdown or abrupt stoppage of operations at one or more of the company s facilities due to the failure of one or more critical processes or business systems 
such failures could result in interruptions in manufacturing  safety and or environmental systems  and or a temporary inability to receive raw materials  ship finished products and process orders and invoices 
although not anticipated at this time  if such or similar scenarios were to occur  they could  depending on their duration  have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
such theoretical consequences are of a kind and magnitude generally shared with other manufacturing companies 
assuming the successful completion of its year program in a timely manner  the company expects that any year disruptions which occur  should there be any  will be minor and not material to its business 
estimates and conclusions herein contain forward looking statements and are based on management s best estimates of future events

fas will be effective for the company on december   the beginning of fiscal year the company currently does not expect the impact of adopting fas to be material 
compared with sales increased for the seventh consecutive year  as sales at million were up over from levels 
the major contributors to the growth were the october   and january   acquisitions  now operating as brite line technologies  inc  and plymouth rubber europa  sa  respectively  which contributed to of the growth 
plymouth rubber s core business parent company without subsidiaries sales were up over  as capacity restrictions continued to limit production output in the canton manufacturing facility 
in the core business  commitments to providing product to the automotive market resulted in sales increases of over in that market while sales in the non automotive oem market decreased and sales in other markets were flat or down slightly from levels  due primarily to the capacity restrictions 
in february   the company announced a million capital investment program to substantially increase the company s manufacturing capacity  reduce costs and improve productivity 
the largest step in the program  accounting for over half of the planned expenditure  was a new vinyl calender and auxiliary equipment  which began production in the third quarter of gross margin as a percentage of sales improved to in from in plymouth s core business gross margin improved from in to in  as higher volumes and product cost reductions were partially offset by higher plant maintenance expenses and higher indirect labor and training costs  which were incurred in preparation for the company s increase in manufacturing capacity 
in addition  brite line s gross margin contributed to the improved overall percentage 
europa s gross margin was 
selling expenses as a percentage of sales were and in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to the addition of brite line 
selling expenses for in plymouth s core business were slightly higher when compared with levels  as increased outside warehouse costs were somewhat offset by lower advertising  commissions  and freight 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in as compared to in the consolidation of the brite line and europa subsidiaries was the primary contributor to the increase in general and administrative expenses  although some of brite line s administrative functions were absorbed by the parent company 
plymouth s core business also had increases in employee recruiting  salaries  and k contributions to supplement the company s previously frozen pension plan  offset by lower employee incentive compensation 
interest expense as a percentage of sales increased from in to in or a total increase of  from this increase reflected higher loan volume due primarily to the financing of the two acquisitions  offset in part by reduced interest rates 
other income  net increased from  in to  in  due primarily to the sale of some unused real estate in foreign currency exchange loss increased from  in to  in  resulting from foreign currency denominated sales and from intercompany receivables with the plymouth europa subsidiary  in combination with a strengthening dollar and longer payment terms which are in accordance with local customs 
as a result of the factors described above  income before tax increased from  in to  in the effective tax rate in was of pre tax income compared to a  tax benefit in  due primarily to a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
as a result  net income was  in and  in cash generated from operating activities was  in as compared to  in three major contributors to cash inflows were net income  depreciation and amortization  and a reduction in inventory  which occurred in plymouth s core business work in process and finished goods inventory  offset by inventory increases from the two newly consolidated subsidiaries 
the major operating use of cash was an increase in accounts receivable  which was also due in large part to the additional new subsidiaries 
during  the company used  in proceeds from additional term debt   from its revolving line of credit  and  from the sale lease back of certain new capital equipment to fund the cash portion of the purchase of cintas adhesivas nunez  sa now operating as plymouth rubber europa  sa for  increase its investment in brite line technologies  inc by  purchase  of capital equipment  the largest item being the new vinyl calendering line  and reduce term debt by  liquidity and capital resources during  plymouth rubber initiated a significant capital expansion program  including a new calender and associated equipment  which substantially increased its vinyl tape production capacity 
at the end of fiscal and the beginning of fiscal  the company also invested in new subsidiaries brite line technologies  inc  and plymouth rubber europa  sa  which it considers to be strategic opportunities 
in connection with these investments  the company has increased its debt from approximately of total capitalization in to approximately in and in the company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants as of november  although several of these covenants will become more restrictive in  the company believes that it will meet these covenants during based upon current projections

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at november   the carrying value of company s debt totaled million which approximated its fair value 
this debt includes amounts at both fixed and variable interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at november   the company had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of fixed rate debt by approximately  the earnings and cash flows impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately  holding other variables constant
