income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  asset liability management and market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial performance is impacted by  among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
the company utilizes no derivative instruments to mitigate its credit risk  relying instead on strict underwriting standards  loan review  and an adequate loan loss reserve 
interest rate risk is the risk of loss in value due to changes in interest rates 
this risk is addressed by the company s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives 
alco monitors and considers methods of managing interest rate risk by monitoring changes in economic value of equity eve and net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
market value has taken on greater interest as a measure of equity risk 
by marking to market the components of the balance sheet  the company can compute the market value of equity 
not unlike a bond analysis  interest rates are changed at various increments and the new market value is calculated 
alco attempts to manage the various components of the company s balance sheet to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on eve and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
rate risk measurement is undertaken to determine potential loss in the net interest margin nim and  ultimately  in each bank s capital ratio 
one of the most popular methods used to estimate interest rate risk is the rate sensitivity gap 
the theory states that interest rate risk is due to the volume differences  called gap  between repricable assets and liabilities over a specific period of time 
nim change can be quantified by assuming a rate change and applying it to this gap 
if potential changes to eve and nim resulting from hypothetical interest rate swings are not within limits acceptable by the board of directors  the board of directors may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within acceptable limits 
to ensure that the company s eve and nim remain within acceptable limits the following strategies have been developed 
first  greater emphasis has been placed on adjustable rate loans  which generally reprice in one year or less 
second  its investment activities are short and medium term securities 
third  attempt to maintain and increase regular savings and transaction deposit accounts 
fourth  utilize long term borrowings to match long term assets 
the following table presents the company s projected change in eve and net interest income for the various rate shock levels as of december  eve and the impact on net interest income for the company are regularly calculated internally 
changes in economic value of equity market value of change in portfolio actual percent interest rates equity change change basis point rise   base rate scenario  
basis point decline   changes in net interest income net change in interest actual percent interest rates income change change basis point rise   base rate scenario  
basis point decline   the preceding table indicates that at december   in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  the company s eve would be expected to decrease and in the event of a decrease in prevailing market rates  the company s net interest income would be expected to decrease 
at december   the company s estimated changes in eve were acceptable to the board of directors 
rate risk analysis can be complex and risk can only be estimated 
computation of forecasted effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity gap up to one year as of december   excluding now and savings accounts  which the company does not consider to be rate sensitive  the company has a positive interest sensitivity gap up to one year

financial condition the company  including the banks  reported consolidated total assets of approximately million at december  and million at december  representing an increase of approximately million for the year ended december  loan growth exceeded deposit growth as loans increased approximately million and deposits increased approximately million 
additionally  funds were provided by operations of million  sale of stock of  federal home loan bank advances of million  decrease in interest bearing deposits of million  increase in federal funds purchased and other borrowings of million and decrease in federal funds sold of  these funds were used to purchase additional bank premises and equipment of million  pay dividends of million  increase investment securities million  increase cash by million and decrease note payable to a correspondent bank by million 
the growth in loans and deposits is attributable to several factors including growth in the customer base due to the business development efforts of the management team  the pricing of loans and deposits and the favorable economic conditions experienced in the markets served by the banks 
the changes in interest rates as previously discussed are reflective of interest rates in general and market conditions including competition 
changes in short term funds including cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits and investment securities are reflective of the liquidity position of the company 
the company s capital to assets ratio as of december  and was and  respectively 
the company and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the state and federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s and the banks financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and of tier i capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes  as of december  and  that the company and the banks meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the most recent notification from banking regulators categorized the company and the banks as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as adequately capitalized  the company and the banks must maintain minimum total risk based  tier i risk based  and tier i leverage ratios as set forth in the table 
there have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institutions category 
the company s consolidated actual capital amounts and ratios and the minimum amounts and ratios under the capital adequacy and prompt corrective action provisions are presented below to be well capitalized under for capital prompt corrective actual adequacy purposes action provision amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets    tier i capital to risk weighted assets    tier i capital to average assets    as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets    tier i capital to risk weighted assets    tier i capital to average assets    liquidity and capital resources liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers  for the withdrawal of funds or the funding of additional loans  and the ability of the banks to meet those requirements 
management monitors and maintains appropriate levels of assets and liabilities so that maturities of assets are such that adequate funds are provided to meet estimated customer withdrawals and loan requests 
the banks liquidity position depends primarily upon the liquidity of its assets relative to its need to respond to short term demand for funds caused by withdrawals from deposit accounts and loan funding commitments 
primary sources of liquidity are scheduled payments on its loans and interest on the banks investments 
the banks may also utilize their cash and due from banks  short term deposits with financial institutions  federal funds sold and investment securities to meet liquidity requirements 
at december   the banks cash and due from banks were approximately million after reduction for their required reserves of million  their short term deposits with financial institutions were million  and their federal funds sold were million 
the effect of the required reserves is to reduce available liquidity 
all of the above can be converted to cash on short notice 
the sale of investments  which had a market value of approximately million at december   can also be used to meet liquidity requirements  to the extent the investments are not pledged to secure public funds on deposit as required by law 
securities with a market value of million were pledged as of december  the banks funding needs are based primarily on the volume of lending 
the primary funding source is from new deposits 
the banks seek to attract new deposits by paying rates of interest on deposit accounts which are competitive in their respective primary service areas 
the banks generally do not pay brokers commissions in connection with the obtaining of deposits or have deposits outside the primary service area 
the banks do not pay premiums to attract deposits 
as of december   the average cost for deposit liabilities was approximately 
the banks continue to expect that new deposits will serve as its primary funding source 
the banks also have the ability  on a short term basis  to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions 
the banks are members of the federal home loan bank of atlanta and as such have the ability to secure advances therefrom  although the cost of such advances exceed lower cost alternatives such as deposits from the local communities 
the banks had advances outstanding from the federal home loan bank of atlanta of million at december  at an average rate of

reserve for possible loan losses an allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior loan loss experience 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  specific impaired loans and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
the reserve for possible loan losses was approximately of outstanding loans at december  and at december  the reserve was increased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  nonperforming loans increased from approximately  at december  to approximately million at december   representing 
of total loans 
management believes that the reserve for loan losses of approximately million at december  is adequate due to the  of charge offs in the year ended december  and the fact that approximately million or of the banks loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by real estate

total    deposit maturities the principal sources of funds for the banks loans and investments are demand  time  savings and other deposits and borrowings 
the banks offer a variety of deposit accounts including checking and now accounts  savings and time accounts  certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
as of december   total deposits were approximately million compared to approximately million at december  and compared to approximately million at december  although  in some instances  time deposits greater than  may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates  substantially all the banks deposits are derived from within their primary service areas which management believes are not as interest rate sensitive as are more urban service areas 
the banks do not have any brokered deposits

the banks ability to reprice assets and liabilities in the same dollar amounts and at the same time minimizes interest rate risks 
one method of measuring the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income is to measure  in a number of time frames  the interest sensitivity gap  by subtracting interest sensitive liabilities from interest sensitive assets  as reflected in the following table 
such interest sensitivity gap represents the risk  or opportunity  in repricing 
if more assets than liabilities are repriced at a given time in a rising rate environment  net interest income improves  in a declining rate environment  net interest income deteriorates 
conversely  if more liabilities than assets are repriced while interest rates are rising  net interest income deteriorates  if interest rates are falling  net interest income improves

impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and inventories and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices 
while the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates  interest rates react more to change in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of the company s ability to react to changing interest rates

year the year issue refers generally to the data structure and processing problem that may prevent systems from properly processing data sensitive information when the year changes to the year issue affects it systems  such as computer programs and various types of electronic equipment that process data information by using only two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year  and thus may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the issue also affects some non it systems  such as devices which rely on a microcontroller to process date information 
the year issue could disrupt a company s operations by generating erroneous data or causing system failures or miscalculations 
the company s state of readiness the company has implemented a year readiness program designed to ensure that the company s computer systems and applications will function properly beyond this program is also designed to assess the readiness of other entities with which the company and its affiliates do business 
this program has been divided into five phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
the major areas of focus include hardware  software  embedded chips  third party vendors as well as third party data centers 
management s target date for completion of all phases for its mission critical applications is june  mission critical applications include those that i directly affect delivery of primary services to the banks customers  ii directly affect revenue recognition and collection  iii would create noncompliance with any statutes or laws  and iv would require significant costs to address in the event of noncompliance 
the principal critical area consists of software and hardware that comprise the core of the banks customer servicing systems 
testing of these components has been ongoing since the third quarter of and will continue until year compliance has been achieved 
as of december   the awareness  assessment  renovation and validation phases for mission critical applications were each approximately to complete 
the implementation phase is approximately complete 
costs to address the company s year issues expenses associated with the company s year compliance effort for fiscal year were between  and  expenses projected for fiscal year are between  and  additionally  capital investment estimates are between  and  over the life of the project 
contingency plans the company has developed a contingency plan in connection with its year readiness program  including a back up site as well as back up procedures with southern financial systems  located in macon  georgia  for its in house data processing system 
however  the company realizes that any reasonable contingency plan cannot accurately account for all possible scenarios which may arise as a result of year related computation problems 
eagle bank and trust utilizes a third party service bureau  m i data services  located in brown deer  wisconsin  which has substantially completed all five phases of its year readiness program 
risks of the company s year issues the company anticipates that its mission critical applications will be year compliant by june  however  no assurance can be given that unforeseen circumstances will not arise during the performance of the testing and implementation phases 
furthermore  the year compliance status of third party suppliers and networks  which could adversely impact the company s applications  cannot be fully known 
the company is unable to determine the impact that any system interruption would have on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
however  such impact could be material
