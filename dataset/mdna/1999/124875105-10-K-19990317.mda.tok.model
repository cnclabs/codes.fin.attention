the contribution of free liabilities to the net interest margin computed as net interest margin less the interest rate spread rose to basis points in from basis points in the overall increase in net interest income of million was due to increases in volume of million and rate of million 
growth in the average earning asset base in the previous three years has primarily occurred in the loans and lease financing portfolio 
following a trend begun in  the mix in earning assets continued to shift toward loans and lease financing due to increased loan demand 
expansion of the earning asset base during the periods presented has been funded primarily with increases in the deposit base and the retention of earnings 
substantially all deposits originate within the market areas of ccb and amfed 
average total deposits increased by approximately million or in and million or in noninterest income and noninterest expenses noninterest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts  trust and custodian fees  sales and insurance commissions  fees and service charges for various other banking services provided to customers  mortgage servicing and secondary marketing income and accretion of negative goodwill resulting from past acquisitions 
noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and losses  totaled million for the year ended  an million increase over increases in noninterest income were experienced in all categories of other income due to growth of the asset and customer bases  a stronger emphasis on the collection of fees for services rendered and new revenue generating customer service initiatives 
in addition  the subsidiary banks adopted a heightened sales focus which resulted in higher revenues in noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and losses  totaled million in and million in the five year compound growth rate for noninterest income is at december  service charges on deposit accounts continue to be the largest source of noninterest income totaling million in compared to million in  a increase 
the increase was due primarily to growth in the deposit base  repricing of certain customer services and surcharge income from foreign non subsidiary bank customers atm use on the subsidiary banks expanded atm network 
additionally  over the past several years  a greater emphasis has been placed on developing new commercial service products and attracting commercial customers 
service charges on commercial accounts have increased from million in to million in due to the higher volume of accounts and expansion of products offered 
the corporation monitors service charges closely and evaluates such fees periodically to ensure that they reflect the costs of providing the services and are competitive in the marketplace 
trust and custodian fees rose to million in from million in due to growth of assets managed  new trust business acquired in and the continued promotion of employee benefit trust products introduced in trust and custodian fees totaled million in expansion of trust operations have resulted from the mid acquisition of institutional trust business from barnett bank which operates from salem trust company s three florida offices  the opening of a trust office in virginia in the third quarter of and the mid opening of a two office trust department by amfed 
in addition to the focus on institutional trust business  management is positioning the trust departments to attract new consumer trust business

despite the advances made in increasing noninterest income over the past three years  management believes significant future growth opportunities are available through branch optimization and further expansion of trust  brokerage and insurance services and professional banking 
branch optimization includes not only placing branches in the right locations and closing duplicate facilities but designing branch operations for maximum productivity profitability 
during  ccb experimented with a new branch design called sales centers 
the new design seeks to increase productivity from the traditional branch model by employing energetic  sales oriented individuals who are trained to function as a teller  sales and service representative and loan originator 
these individuals are compensated based on their revenue production 
the sales center approach was initially instituted at three branches in greensboro  north carolina  improvements in sales and profitability in those pilot sales centers were very encouraging 
during  three branches were opened as sales centers  management plans to convert of existing branches to the sales center model by beginning in  the subsidiary banks expanded trust services to florida and virginia 
while salem trust company s florida operations were founded upon a book of business acquired from barnett bank  it is pursuing new institutional customers 
ccb s virginia trust office was opened in response to growth opportunities identified in that market 
in order to compete with other financial service providers  ccbi and asc must expand their investment and insurance offerings 
beginning in  ccbi began a series of initiatives related to expanding its life insurance services 
growth in this area is anticipated to come from existing insurance customers  referrals from within the subsidiary banks and target marketing potential customers 
insurance products will be offered through a combination of dedicated insurance agents  direct mail solicitations  telephone sales specialists  joint ventures with third party sales forces and eventually  over the internet 
new professional banking offices are planned for certain metropolitan areas  these offices will cater to higher wealth individuals with a focus on providing high touch quality service

the taxable equivalent basis is computed using a federal tax rate and applicable state tax rates 
noninterest expenses  excluding non recurring items  rose million or in over s level of million 
this increase was due primarily to a million increase in personnel expense 
as reported in table  total noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets rose to from s indicating that noninterest expenses grew at a faster rate than average assets 
the increase in personnel expense was due in part to general wage increases and a greater emphasis on incentive based compensation 
commissions and incentive pay totaled million in compared to million in temporary and contract personnel costs rose  due to a tight labor market in the subsidiary banks market area and the need for specialized personnel to complete various initiatives 
net occupancy and equipment expenses were up million for the year ended december  the increases experienced in were due primarily to increased computer equipment costs incurred as a result of year remediation as discussed later and other technological initiatives such as implementation of a data warehouse and improved branch platforms

strong loan growth during resulted in an increase in average loans and lease financing and a increase in average assets 
the five year compound growth rate for average loans and lease financing is and for average assets is 
the subsidiary banks loan portfolios are comprised primarily of diversified credits with little borrower or industry concentration 
management believes that lending to medium sized commercial customers and consumers allows a higher interest rate spread which helps support the net interest margin 
table shows the year end breakdown of the major categories of the loans and lease financing portfolio for the previous five years based upon regulatory classifications 
outstanding loans and lease financing increased million over s outstandings 
all of the loan growth was internally generated 
substantially all loans are made on a secured basis with the exception of certain revolving credit accounts and  with the exception of marketable mortgage loans  are originated for retention in the subsidiary banks portfolios 
in general  the subsidiary banks do not purchase loans or participate with others in the origination of loans and confine their lending activities to north and south carolina except for credit card receivables which are offered on a nationwide basis and automobile loans which are offered from virginia to georgia through referrals from a major automobile insurance company 
lending officers of the subsidiary banks generally consider the cash flow or earnings power of the borrower as the primary source of repayment 
the subsidiary banks do not engage in highly leveraged transactions or foreign lending activities 
there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans other than those categories included in table t a b l e loans and lease financing in thousands as of december commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      instalment loans to individuals      revolving credit      lease financing      total gross loans and lease financing      less unearned income      total loans and lease financing      loans in the commercial  financial and agricultural category consist primarily of short term and or floating rate commercial loans made to medium sized companies 
there is no substantial loan concentration in any one industry or to any one borrower 
real estate construction loans are primarily made to commercial developers and residential contractors on a floating rate basis 
cash flow analyses for each project are the primary decision factor  with additional reliance upon collateral values 
management expects moderate to strong growth in these categories during the subsidiary banks will maintain their focus on quality credit underwriting 
see table for a schedule of maturities and sensitivities of certain loan types to changes in interest rates 
real estate mortgage loans consist primarily of loans secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residences of total real estate mortgage loans 
the remainder of real estate mortgage loans are primarily for commercial purposes and often include the commercial borrower s real property in addition to other collateral 
it is the subsidiary banks general policy to sell current originations and retain only certain adjustable and fixed rate loans in the portfolio 
the lower interest rate environment experienced in is expected to continue in while these rates may generate high production volume  with the subsidiary banks planned sales of loans  the mortgage portfolio will not grow in proportion to s anticipated production volume 
consequently  management anticipates only moderate growth in this category during instalment loans to individuals consist primarily of loans secured by automobiles and other consumer personal property 
lending officers consider the customer s debt obligations  ability and willingness to repay and general economic trends in their decision to extend credit 
since  the corporation has had an alliance with a major automobile insurance company  which  through referrals from company agents  has increased the amount of automobile loans outstanding 
the agreements with the insurance company cover a market area stretching from virginia to georgia 
revolving credit includes overdraft protection and traditional credit card products 
the credit card program was restructured in late resulting in more options based on credit card interest rates and annual fees 
additionally  a credit card product offering travel awards for airline flights based on card usage was introduced where the travel awards are not limited to a particular travel partner but can be used with any of the major airlines 
amfed did not offer credit cards at the time of the merger and thus their customer base provides an additional opportunity to grow the credit card portfolio 
with continued emphasis on prudent underwriting standards  management expects moderate growth during the leasing portfolio  net of unearned income  increased in to million 
the leasing portfolio is not concentrated in any one line of business or type of equipment 
the lease growth in resulted from instituting a leasing program at amfed and expanding of the number of ccb lenders originating leases

these funds are being primarily reinvested in shorter term us government agencies as there is not an interest rate advantage in committing funds to longer term investments 
investment securities as a percentage of earning assets declined due to the previously discussed shift in earning assets to higher yielding loans 
average investment securities totaled of average earning assets for versus for taxable securities remain the primary component of the portfolio

long term debt and other borrowings the corporation s ratio of long term debt to shareholders equity increased to at december  from at december  the increase was due to obtaining additional advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb at favorable interest rates

in the increase continues the corporation s thirty four year trend of annual dividend increases  a record that places the corporation first among us banks tracked by moody s investors service 
dividends paid as a percentage of earnings  excluding non recurring items  equaled  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
the corporation s dividend guideline is to pay approximately to of operating earnings in dividends 
management feels that this guideline provides a reasonable cash return to shareholders and at the same time maintains sufficient equity to support future growth and expansion 
capital expenditures for new and improved facilities as well as furniture and equipment amounted to million in  million in and million in there were no significant capital resource commitments at december  other than the operating lease commitments specified in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and resolution of year technology concerns as discussed below 
additionally  the corporation has budgeted million in for technological improvements and new or renovated facilities 
technology improvements totaling million planned for include tools to enhance cross selling  track profitability of individual customers and measure product profitability 
year issue the corporation is in the midst of its project to assess and correct the impact of the year issue 
the year issue resulted from many computer programs having been written using two digit dates rather than four to define the applicable year 
historically  the first two digits were eliminated to save memory 
since in such systems there is no accommodation for the full four digit year  a serious problem may occur when is used to identify the year for these systems  it is not only impossible to distinguish from but it also becomes difficult to calculate the passage of time between preceding or succeeding years and the year this error could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  an inability to process customer transactions  properly accrue interest income and expense or engage in normal business activities 
in addition  non information technology non it systems such as security alarms  elevators  telephones  etc 
may be subject to a year malfunction due to their dependence upon computer technology for proper operation 
as described  the year issue presents a number of challenges to financial institutions management  correction of year issues has been and will continue to be costly and complex for the entire industry 
the corporation began discussing the year issue more than two years ago and adopted a year strategic project plan to address the issue 
the corporation s year plan follows guidelines outlined by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
the ffiec requires all financial institutions to develop plans with five critical phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
the awareness phase defined the year issue and the potential challenges associated with the date change 
the assessment phase consisted of an evaluation of the size and complexity of ensuring that the corporation will be ready for the year during the assessment phase  the corporation determined that it would be required to modify a significant portion of its software and replace certain software and hardware so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  during the renovation phase  system upgrades were implemented and applicable hardware was replaced 
the validation phase involves testing all computer systems 
even if software has been tested by the vendor and certified year ready  the corporation s year project team is re testing and validating all software to ensure compatibility with the corporation s information systems environment 
the implementation phase is the final step which involves incorporating year ready systems into the day to day operations of the corporation 
the renovation of all major software applications was completed in early september testing of mission critical systems was substantially completed by the end of this consisted of performing tests on the mainframe hardware  operating system  and application software  pc and server hardware and software  data and telecommunications systems  and non it systems 
a new year ready mainframe computer was put into production during mid january substantially all non mission critical testing and replacement of non mission critical personal computers is scheduled to be completed by the end of march the corporation plans to complete the year project by the end of june testing of hardware and software acquired or modified since initial testing was completed will be done in the remainder of as part of on going due diligence 
in addition to ensuring the proper operation of its systems  the corporation is also monitoring the remediation efforts of third party entities whose own year disruptions would impact the corporation s operations 
the incurred to date and estimated costs to assess the impact of third parties remediation efforts are included in the corporation s total year project costs and estimates 
the project team identified the vendors whose operations were deemed mission critical to the corporation s operations and contacted those vendors regarding their progress in correcting their year issues 
in addition  the corporation initiated communication with its major customers to determine the extent of their year preparedness 
as most corporate customers depend on computer systems for normal operations  a disruption in their business could result in potentially significant financial difficulties 
in the loan and deposit areas  major customers of million or more have been identified 
as of december   the corporation had contacted in excess of of major customers and evaluated the risk to the corporation based upon the results of the customer communication 
also  the corporation has reviewed certain issuers of debt securities held in the investment securities portfolio as well as federal funds counter parties 
in the trust area  the corporation has reviewed certain issuers of debt and equity securities held as managed investment assets 
finally  financial institutions such as the subsidiary banks exchange large volumes of date sensitive data electronically between other financial institutions  clearing houses  customers and regulatory agencies 
the corporation has tested and verified  as appropriate  these data exchanges 
based on these reviews of critical vendors  major customers and other major counter parties  at present the corporation feels that there is not an inordinate amount of risk which would require the establishment of any special reserves for the year issue 
the corporation will continue to monitor and test the remediation efforts of these third parties and determine if it needs to modify its own operations due to their failure to remediate their year issue 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the corporation s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the corporation s systems  will not have an adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
the corporation has a contingency plan that outlines emergency response procedures that meet regulatory guidelines 
the goal of the contingency plan is to facilitate the resumption of business in the event there is a disruption of critical systems necessary to operate 
contingency plans include alternative power sources  off site processing  etc 
the ffiec s contingency planning guidelines require the completion of organizational planning guidelines and business impact analysis by march  ffiec guidelines further require that the development and validation of the business resumption contingency plans be completed by june  the corporation completed its organizational planning guidelines and business impact analysis in october the corporation s contingency plans include consideration of the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
development and validation of the contingency plans and independent review and verification of the contingency plans were completed in february the last contingency planning requirement  developing detailed year rollover event plans  is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of while the corporation s project team is monitoring the progress of the year plan  consulting firms are also being used to keep track of the readiness program 
a year independent consulting services group is overseeing the year project management office on an on going basis 
in addition  the corporation retained the services of another independent consulting firm to review its year readiness plans 
as the corporation and its subsidiary banks are regulated by federal and state banking regulatory agencies  they are required to comply with those agencies year modification schedules 
federal regulatory agencies periodically review the corporation s year conversion efforts and have had no adverse criticism on the progress to date or its anticipated schedule to complete the year project 
management believes that it will meet the regulators timeframe for year compliance 
the total cost of the year project is currently estimated at million  of which million is attributable to the purchase of capitalizable software and hardware 
since the third quarter of  estimated costs for the year project have increased by  estimated hardware and software costs were increased by  and the remaining  was earmarked for the development of detailed business resumption plans and a support contract with the corporation s year independent consulting services group to extend through the millennium rollover 
during  the corporation incurred million of non capitalizable expense attributable to the year project 
total non capitalizable expense incurred prior to was less than  the remainder of the cost will be expensed as incurred over the next two years and is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
the costs of the year project and the dates the corporation plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved at the cost disclosed or within the timeframe anticipated 
management presently believes that with its identified modifications to existing software and conversions to new software and hardware and the successful completion of third party remediation efforts  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if the corporation s modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed on a timely basis or if mission critical third parties do not remediate their own year issues  disruptions in operations could occur and could have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the corporation

unallocated portion of reserve    total    management performs a detailed analysis of the loan and lease portfolio to determine the adequacy of the reserve for loan and lease losses 
the reserve is comprised of allocated and unallocated portions 
the allocated reserve consists of specific as well as general allocations 
specific loan loss allocations are determined for significant credits where management believes that a risk of loss exists 
a key tool in controlling loan losses is the corporation s loan grading system that begins at the inception of the credit relationship 
under this grading system  substantially all credit relationships greater than  excluding residential mortgage and home equity lines are assigned grades that direct the timing and intensity of loan review activity throughout the life of the relationship 
all significant relationships are reviewed at least annually 
relationships that have the lowest grade are reviewed each thirty days 
all relationships in excess of  which have been internally classified as special mention  substandard or loss are evaluated individually for their potential loss  factors such as collateral value and guarantor strength are included in the evaluation process 
in addition  general allocations are determined for each loan type by assigning a risk factor to compute their respective loss reserve 
the risk factors have been developed using historical loss levels  economic trends  market conditions and other factors 
the allocated reserve is determined as a result of this analysis which includes the specific and general reserves discussed above 
during  management adjusted the risk factors used for general allocation of the reserve among the respective loan categories 
the risk factors were adjusted upward in consideration of historical charge off rates  recent trends in consumer debt levels  increased consumer bankruptcy rates nationally and in north carolina and other pertinent factors 
management reviews risk assets and charge offs by loan type on a monthly basis 
for the unallocated portion of the reserve for loan and lease losses  management determines the appropriate level of unallocated reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios and for unfavorable credit events that may have occurred for specific borrowers of which management is not yet aware 
factors considered in management s determination of the appropriate level of unallocated reserve are general economic and lending trends 
the level of unallocated reserves as of year end has declined from prior years 
management believes that the reserve for loan and lease losses is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan and lease financing portfolio 
the most recent regulatory agency examinations have not revealed any material problem credits that had not been previously identified  however  future regulatory examinations may result in the regulatory agencies requiring additions to the reserve for loan and lease losses based on information available at the examination date 
liquidity and interest sensitivity liquidity ensures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan and capital expenditure commitments  maintain reserve requirements  pay operating expenses  provide funds for dividends  debt service and other commitments and operate the organization on an ongoing basis 
funds are primarily provided by the subsidiary banks through financial resources from operating activities  expansion of the deposit base  borrowing funds in money market operations and through the sale or maturity of assets 
net cash provided by operating activities and deposits from customers have historically been the primary sources of liquidity for the corporation 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
average total deposits have grown by million  million and million during the three previous years 
average certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more still comprise a relatively small percentage of average total deposits  in versus in these deposits grew on average million from to management intentionally keeps the corporation s reliance on the higher cost large certificates of deposit low because of the availability of less expensive sources of funding and considers them a secondary source of liquidity that can be obtained as needed 
at december   time certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more were million compared to million at december  during  the maximum month end balance for time certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more totaled million 
the following is a remaining maturity schedule of these deposits at december  in thousands over over months through through or less months months total jumbo deposits     at december   the subsidiary banks were net short term lenders as average short term investments exceeded average short term liabilities by million 
in the past several years  the subsidiary banks have been net short term borrowers 
the change to being a net short term lender was due to s interest rate environment the subsidiary banks received higher than normal paydowns on mortgage backed securities due to the fall in mortgage interest rates  excess funds were not reinvested in longer term investment securities due to the flat yield curve and the subsidiary banks were able to obtain longer term borrowings at attractive interest rates 
in and  average short term borrowings exceeded short term investments by million and million  respectively  due to high loan demand 
correspondent relationships are maintained with several larger banks enabling the subsidiary banks to purchase federal funds when needed 
also available as liquidity sources are access to the federal reserve discount window and ccb s million line of credit maintained with the fhlb 
this line of credit is secured by a blanket collateral agreement on ccb s mortgage loan portfolio 
maturities of securities held for investment and sales and maturities of securities categorized as available for sale are other sources of liquidity 
securities with carrying values of million mature in the available for sale portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  obligations of us government agencies and corporations and equity securities 
securities available for sale are considered in the corporation s asset liability management strategies and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  liquidity needs and or significant prepayment risk 
liquidity at the parent company level is provided through cash dividends from the subsidiary banks and the capacity of the parent company to raise additional borrowed funds as needed 
at december   the parent company had an unused million credit agreement with a financial institution 
the credit agreement is unsecured and expires in november in addition to ensuring adequate liquidity  the corporation is concerned with the management of its balance sheet to maintain relatively stable net interest margins despite changes in the interest rate environment 
responsibility for both liquidity and interest sensitivity management rests with the corporation s asset liability management committee alco comprised of senior management 
alco reviews the corporation s interest rate and liquidity exposures and  based on its view of existing and expected market conditions  adopts balance sheet strategies that are intended to optimize net interest income to the extent possible while minimizing the risk associated with unanticipated changes in interest rates 
determining and monitoring the appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities and the impact on earnings of changes in interest rates is accomplished through alco s use of gap analysis and simulation analysis 
gap analysis measures the interest sensitivity of assets and liabilities at a given point in time 
the interest sensitivity of assets and liabilities is based on the timing of contractual maturities and repricing opportunities 
prepayments of loans and certain investment securities and early withdrawals of deposits represent options which may or may not be exercised and thus are not considered in the gap analysis 
a positive interest sensitive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities 
the reverse situation results in a negative gap 
management feels that an essentially balanced position of total earning assets between interest sensitive assets and liabilities is necessary in order to protect against wide fluctuations in interest rates 
an analysis of the corporation s interest sensitivity position at december  is presented in table at december   the corporation had a cumulative negative gap interest sensitive liabilities exceeding interest sensitive assets of million or of total earning assets over a twelve month horizon 
the ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities was 
x 
gap analysis is a limited measurement tool  however  because it does not incorporate the interrelationships between interest rates charged or paid  balance sheet trends and management s reaction in response to interest rate changes 
in addition  a gap analysis model does not consider that changes in interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
therefore  alco uses gap analysis as a tool to monitor changes in the balance sheet structure 
to estimate the impact that changes in interest rates would have on the corporation s earnings  alco uses simulation analysis

the interest sensitivity position has meaning only as of the date for which it is prepared

the mark to market adjustment of  for available for sale securities is not included 
simulation analysis is performed using a computer based asset liability model incorporating current portfolio balances and rates  contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  and assumptions about prepayments  future interest rates  and future volumes 
using this information  the model calculates earnings estimates for the corporation under multiple interest rate scenarios 
to measure the sensitivity of the corporation s earnings  the results of multiple simulations  which assume changes in interest rates  are compared to the base case simulation  which assumes no changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity of earnings is expressed as a percentage change in comparison to the base case simulation 
as a matter of policy  alco has stated that the maximum negative impact to net income from a positive or negative basis point change in interest rates over a month period should not exceed  which was achieved during and at december   earnings sensitivity was well under this guideline as a basis point increase is projected to decrease net income 
and a basis point decrease is projected to decrease net income 
alco in practice manages earnings sensitivity  however  with a targeted goal of only a to impact on net income 
if simulation results show that earnings sensitivity exceeds the targeted limits  alco will adopt on balance sheet and or off balance sheet strategies to bring earnings sensitivity within target guidelines 
management uses both on and off balance sheet strategies to manage the balance sheet 
the most efficient and cost effective method of on balance sheet management is creating desired maturity and repricing streams through the tactical pricing of interest earning and interest bearing on balance sheet products 
alco reviews the interest earning and interest bearing portfolios to ensure that the corporation has a proper mix of fixed and variable rate products 
emphasis will continue to be placed on granting loans with short maturities and floating rates where possible 
this strategy increases liquidity and is necessitated by the continued shortening of maturities and more frequent repricing opportunities of the corporation s funding sources 
as of year end  approximately of all loans reprice or mature within days 
see table for additional detail regarding loan maturity and sensitivity to changes in interest rates at december  within the corporation s overall interest rate risk management strategy  off balance sheet derivatives have been and may be used in the future as a cost and capital efficient way to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing or maturity of on balance sheet assets or liabilities 
as of december   the corporation had off balance sheet derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps basis swaps with notional principal of million 
the interest rate swaps were entered into in november and april and have two year terms 
the purpose of entering into the interest rate swaps was to synthetically convert us treasury based liabilities into prime rate based liabilities and to lock in a wide spread between the two indices 
these financial instruments had a nominal negative effect on interest expense for and the corporation was not party to any other off balance sheet derivative financial instruments during although off balance sheet derivative financial instruments would not expose the corporation to credit risk equal to the notional amount of the contracts  the corporation would be exposed to credit risk to the extent of the fair value of the unrealized gain if any in the off balance sheet derivative instrument if the counterparty failed to perform 
credit risk resulting from a counterparty s nonperformance of any contracts is being monitored through routine review of the counterparty s financial ratings 
the corporation has not experienced any liquidity problems in the past nor are problems anticipated in the future 
reliance will continue to be placed on the same funding sources  primarily financial resources provided by operating activities and expansion of the core deposit base 
management will continue to monitor the corporation s interest sensitivity position with goals of ensuring adequate liquidity while at the same time seeking profitable spreads between the yields on funding uses and the rates paid for funding sources 
other accounting matters statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives and hedging activities 
it requires that all derivatives be included as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and that such instruments be carried at fair market value through adjustments to either other comprehensive income or current earnings or both  as appropriate 
the corporation is in the process of assessing the impact of this standard 
the standard is effective for financial statements issued for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise  establishes accounting and reporting standards for certain mortgage banking activities 
it also conforms the subsequent accounting for securities retained after the securitization of other types of assets 
the corporation is in the process of assessing the impact of this standard 
the standard is effective for financial statements for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market price and interest rates 
this risk of loss can be reflected in diminished current market values and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
the corporation s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
the structure of the corporation s loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant rise or decline in interest rates may adversely impact net market values and net interest income 
the corporation does not maintain a trading account nor is the corporation subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
responsibility for monitoring interest rate risk rests with the asset liability management committee alco which is comprised of senior management 
alco regularly reviews the corporation s interest rate risk position and adopts balance sheet strategies that are intended to optimize net interest income while maintaining market risk within a set of board approved guidelines 
to estimate the impact that changes in interest rates would have on the corporation s earnings  alco uses simulation analysis 
simulation analysis is performed using a computer based asset liability model which incorporates current portfolio balances and rates  contractual maturities  repricing opportunities and assumptions about prepayments  future interest rates and future volumes 
to measure the sensitivity of the corporation s earnings  the result of multiple simulations  which assume changes in interest rates  are compared to the base case simulation  which assumes no changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity of earnings is expressed as a percentage change in comparison to the base case simulation 
the model assumes an immediate parallel shift in interest rates 
as a matter of policy  alco has stated that the maximum negative impact to net income from a positive or negative basis point change in interest rates over a month period should not exceed 
however  alco in practice manages earnings sensitivity within a targeted range of only a to impact on net income 
the corporation s interest rate risk position based on simulation results as of december  is as follows basis point change in interest rates projected percentage change in net income 

as of december   management believes that it has accomplished its objective to avoid material negative changes in net income resulting from possible future changes in interest rates 
projected percentage changes in net income brought about by changes in interest rates are not material relative to the corporation s net income 
if simulation results indicate earnings sensitivity in excess of the targeted limits  alco will adopt on balance sheet and or off balance sheet strategies to bring earnings sensitivity within target guidelines 
on balance sheet strategies involve the creation of desired maturity and repricing streams through the tactical pricing of interest earning and interest bearing portfolios to ensure that the corporation has a proper mix of fixed and variable rate products 
as of december   the corporation had off balance sheet derivative financial instruments outstanding in the form of interest rate swaps basis swaps with a notional amount of million 
the two year term basis swaps were entered into in november and april to synthetically convert us treasury based liabilities into prime rate based liabilities and to lock in the favorable spread between the two indices 
the corporation was not a party to any other off balance sheet derivative financial instruments during emphasis will continue to be placed on granting loans with short maturities and floating rates where possible 
this strategy increases liquidity and is necessitated by the continued shortening of maturities and more frequent repricing opportunities of the corporation s funding sources 
management will continue to monitor the corporation s interest rate risk position to minimize the adverse impact of earnings caused by changes in interest rates
