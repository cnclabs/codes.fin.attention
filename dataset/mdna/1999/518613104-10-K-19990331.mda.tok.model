in may  the company determined that certain assets of sylvan prometric were impaired as a result of certain strategic changes that were made as a result of pursuing the nec acquisition 
during and after the acquisition negotiations with nec  the company developed certain plans that resulted in required changes in both software systems and hardware currently utilized in sylvan prometric s network of centers 
the plans continued to be valid for the company even after the nec acquisition was terminated 
the impaired assets  consisting of computer equipment and software  were impaired as a result of changes in the technical requirements and specifications of certain computer hardware and software 
the amount of the impairment loss was determined by evaluating the likely sales proceeds from the disposition of the assets compared to their book value 
the company determined that it was unlikely that the net cash proceeds from the sale of any assets would be significant  and therefore recorded an impairment loss equal to the net book value of the assets of million 
during  these assets were disposed of for no significant consideration 
investment and other income increased by million to million during  primarily due to the million non cash dividend income received from the company s investment in jlc holdings  inc and the higher cash and investment balances resulting from the nec termination fee and the proceeds received from the sale of the company s common stock during the company s interest expense decreased by million due to the repayment of all outstanding educational inroads debt in the second quarter of the company reported losses of million in from its investment in affiliates  consisting primarily of million attributable to caliber learning network  inc  in which the company has an equity investment 
the company and mci communications corp 
organized caliber in november of the company s effective tax rate remained constant at in and future assessment of recoverability and impairment of goodwill in connection with its various acquisitions  the company recorded goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of to years  its estimated periods that the company will be benefited by such goodwill 
at december   the unamortized goodwill was million which represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill arises when an acquirer pays more for a business than the fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
for financial reporting purposes  goodwill and all other intangible assets are amortized over the estimated period benefited 
the company has determined the life for amortizing goodwill based upon several factors  the most significant of which are the relative size  historical financial viability and growth trends of the acquired companies and the relative lengths of time such companies have been in existence 
management of the company periodically reviews the company s carrying value and recoverability of unamortized goodwill 
if the facts and circumstances suggest that the goodwill may be impaired  the carrying value of such goodwill will be adjusted which will result in an immediate charge against income during the period of the adjustment and or the length of the remaining amortization period may be shortened  which will result in an increase in the amount of goodwill amortization during the period of adjustment and each period thereafter until fully amortized 
once adjusted  there can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment and recoverability in future periods 
of the various factors to be considered by management of the company in determining whether goodwill is impaired  the most significant will be i losses from operations  ii loss of customers  and iii industry developments  including the company s inability to maintain its market share  development of competitive products or services  and imposition of additional regulatory requirements

the company s investment in working capital continues to reduce net cash flow from operations  particularly as a result of the growth in accounts and notes receivable 
the million increase in accounts and notes receivable is principally the result of a increase in revenue during of the million cash flow reduction attributable to an increase in accounts and notes receivable  approximately million relates to sylvan s expanding testing contracts  with the remainder of the increase related to the company s other operating segments 
the increase in amounts due from expanding testing contracts resulted from higher domestic testing volumes and a significant increase in billings under the international contract with ets to establish overseas testing capacity 
ets typically makes monthly payments for domestic activity and quarterly payments for international services 
notes receivable for new area development agreements accounted for million of the increase in notes receivable from tuition financing activities increased by million

all required regulatory approvals have been received and this transaction is expected to close during the second or third quarter of year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year

the company has established a corporate wide year task force with representatives from all divisions 
the task force has conducted a comprehensive review of the company s information technology and non information technology systems affected by the year issue and has developed an implementation plan to resolve them 
the company measures its progress towards completion based on the level of efforts completed to date compared to the total expected 
the process involves five phases phase i inventory and data collection 
this phase involves conducting a comprehensive inventory of the company s information systems which includes but is not limited to telecommunications systems  computer hardware  software and networks as well as building infrastructure such as hvac  elevators and security systems 
the identification of key third party vendors is also involved 
during this phase  all new systems are required to have passed year compliance tests before being purchased and implemented 
the company commenced this phase in the first quarter of and the phase is complete 
phase ii assessment date impact 
in this phase  systems identified during phase i are reviewed to determine what impact  if any  the year issue has on the operation of these systems 
this phase also identifies the effects of year being a leap year 
this phase is complete 
phase iii remediation 
this phase involves modifying  replacing or upgrading the systems that have failed during phase ii 
the remediation phase is complete and is expected to be completed by the middle of the second quarter of phase iv testing 
this phase involves review of systems for compliance and re testing as necessary 
the testing phase is complete and is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of phase v implementation

to date  the company is not aware of any non compliance by its customers or suppliers that would have material impact on the company s business 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that unanticipated non compliance will not occur  and such non compliance could require material costs to repair or could cause material disruptions if not repaired 
the company is in the process of developing a strategy to address these potential consequences that may result from unresolved year issues  which will include the development of one or more contingency plans by mid euro conversion on january   certain countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and one common currency  the euro

the company is currently evaluating the systems and business issues raised by the euro conversion 
these issues include the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment and the competitive impact of cross border transparency

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
foreign currency risk the company derives approximately of its revenues from customers outside of the united states 
this business is transacted through a network of international subsidiaries  generally in the local currency that is considered the functional currency of that foreign subsidiary 
the company generally views its investment in the majority of its foreign subsidiaries as long term 
the functional currencies of these foreign subsidiaries are principally denominated in the spanish peseta  the british pound sterling  and the australian dollar 
the effects of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries are reflected in other comprehensive income 
a depreciation in year end functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a  decrease in consolidated stockholders equity 
the company s investment in certain foreign subsidiaries providing information technology testing services is considered temporary 
these subsidiaries regularly remit collected testing fees  generally paid in advance of the test and denominated in foreign currencies  to the us parent  which upon test delivery  pays the test sponsor s fee and retains the residual 
the principal currencies of these subsidiaries are the british pound sterling  the german deutsche mark and the japanese yen 
the company is generally not exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to collected fees on undelivered tests as a result of contractual provisions with test sponsors 
foreign exchange gains and losses during the period from the date of test delivery through the date of payment of the test sponsor have not been material  and the company s exposure to such exchange losses at december   assuming a deterioration in foreign exchange rates  would not be material 
the company s foreign operations providing international academic testing services under a cost plus contract with ets are not exposed to foreign currency risk 
under the contract  foreign exchange rate gains and losses are a component of the reimbursable contract costs 
interest rate risk the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due to the short term nature of the company s portfolio 
at december   the company s investment in available for sale  interest bearing securities is not material 
the company s long term revolving credit facility bears interest at variable rates  and the fair value of this instrument is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates under the credit facility for one year would increase interest expense by an immaterial amount
