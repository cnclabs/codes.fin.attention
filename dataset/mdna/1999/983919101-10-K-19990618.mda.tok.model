item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement the statements in this management s discussion and analysis that are forward looking involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
certain of these risks and uncertainties are discussed under factors affecting future operating results 
forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking words  such as may  will  could  should  expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  continue  plan  intend  project  or other similar words 
nature of operations xilinx  inc xilinx or the company designs  develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions  including advanced integrated circuits ics  software design tools  predefined system functions delivered as cores of logic and field engineering support 
the company s programmable logic ics include field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds 
these components are standard ics programmed by xilinx s customers to perform desired logic operations 
xilinx also markets hardwire devices  which are mask programmed ics functionally equivalent to programmed fpgas 
the company s products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers in the data processing  telecommunications  networking  industrial control  instrumentation  high reliability military and consumer markets 
the company markets its products throughout the world through a direct sales organization  direct sales to manufacturers by independent sales representative firms  sales through franchised domestic distributors and sales through foreign distributors 
xilinx s products have provided effective solutions for a wide range of customer logic requirements 
results of operations net revenue in thousands change change net revenues    xilinx s net revenue increased during fiscal the increase was primarily due to the continued penetration in high growth end markets attributable to the xcex  xcxl and xc product lines  which was partially offset by decreased revenues relating to the company s mature xc family as well as the xc family 
despite the revenue growth in fiscal  revenues continue to be impacted by the japanese and asia pacific economic conditions 
the company believes that this factor  as well as others described in factors affecting future operating results  could continue to impact revenues in the near term 
the increase in fiscal over was primarily due to the revenue growth of the  xcex and xcxl devices as well as thexc and xc product lines 
the company currently classifies its product offerings into four categories 
base products consist of the company s mature product families that are currently manufactured on technologies greater than micron  this includes the xc  xc  xc  xc and xc families 
base products represented of total revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal mainstream products are currently manufactured on micron technology and include the xce  xcex  xc and xc product lines 
mainstream products represented of total revenues in fiscal and in fiscal advanced products include the company s newest technologies manufactured on micron and smaller  which include the xcxl  xcxv  xcxla  xcxl  virtex  spartan and spartanxl product lines 
advanced products represented and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of over year over year 
the revenue increase in advanced products was driven primarily by the xcxl product family along with the virtex and spartan product lines 
the company s support products make up the remainder of its product offerings and include serial proms  hardwire  high reliability and software 
support products represented and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
no end customer accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal  or during fiscal  the company s total pld unit shipments increased  compared to fiscal however  the average selling price for the highest volume pld products decreased approximately from fiscal prices while individual products within certain families experienced price decreases in excess of during the year 
in order to expand market share  the company passes on to customers manufacturing cost reductions by reducing prices to the extent that the company can maintain acceptable returns 
price erosion has been common in the semiconductor industry  as advances in both architecture and manufacturing process technology have permitted continual reductions in unit cost 
the company has historically been able to offset much of the revenue declines of its mature technologies with increased revenues from newer technologies  although no assurance can be given that the company can continue to do so in the future 
international revenues represented approximately   and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
international revenues are derived from customers in europe  japan and asia pacific rest of world which represented approximately  and of the company s worldwide revenues  respectively  in fiscal as compared to approximately  and of worldwide revenues  respectively  in fiscal year japan and asia pacific rest of world experienced revenue declines in fiscal as compared to a year ago primarily as a result of the continued weak economic environment in those regions 
europe  japan and asia pacific rest of world experienced revenue growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal although the revenue growth in japan was adversely impacted by the weakened yen relative to the us dollar 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its accounting method for recognizing revenue on all shipments to international distributors 
the change was made retroactive to the beginning of fiscal while the company previously deferred revenue on shipments to domestic distributors until the products were sold to the end user  it recognized revenue upon shipment to international distributors  net of appropriate reserves for returns and allowances 
following the accounting change  revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the end customer 
the company believes that deferral of revenue on shipments to distributors until the product is shipped by the distributor to an end customer is a more meaningful measurement of results of operations as it better conforms to the substance of the transaction considering the changing business environment in the international marketplace  is consistent with industry practice  and accordingly  it will better focus the company on end customer sales  therefore it is a preferable method of accounting 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting method for prior years was a charge of million  net of million in taxes  or net income per diluted share 
gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of revenue includes write off of discontinued product family of million 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was excluding this charge 
during fiscal  the company s gross margin percentage declined from the prior year primarily as a result of a non recurring royalty payment made pursuant to a license settlement with lemelson foundation partnership which was partially offset by lower wafer prices from wafer suppliers  manufacturing process technology improvements  and improved yields that offset selling price reductions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the gross margin percentage remained consistent from fiscal to  excluding the impact of a million write off of a discontinued product family  as selling price reductions were offset by the favorable impact of lower wafer prices from wafer suppliers  manufacturing process technology improvements  the impact of the stronger us dollar against the yen  and improved yields 
the company recognizes that ongoing price reductions for its integrated circuits are a significant element in expanding the market for its products 
management believes that a gross margin objective in the range of to of revenues is consistent with expanding market share while realizing acceptable returns  although there can be no assurance that future gross margins can remain in this range 
during fiscal  the company discontinued the xc family of one time programmable antifuse devices 
as a result  the company recorded a pretax charge against earnings of million 
this charge primarily related to the write off of inventory and termination charges related to purchase commitments to foundry partners for work in process wafers which had not completed the manufacturing process 
research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of revenue the company increased its expenditures in research and development as it has done each year during its fifteen year history 
the increase in research and development expenditures from fiscal to was associated with designing and developing new product architectures of complex  high density devices including wafer purchases  software development  increased labor related costs  and testing of new products along with a million charge to acquire in process technology in conjunction with certain assets purchased from mi acquisition llp 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to was primarily due to increased costs associated with designing and developing new product architectures as well as labor related expenses 
the company remains committed to a significant level of research and development effort in order to maintain its technology leadership in the programmable logic marketplace 
through march   the company has received approximately us patents and maintains an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of software  ic architecture and design 
sales  general and administrative in thousands change change sales  general and administrative    percentage of revenue the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased marketing expenses for new product introductions  increased sales commissions on higher revenues from us distributors along with increased personnel costs 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal over due to increased headcount and related employee expenses and  to a lesser extent  an increase in legal expenses 
the company remains committed to controlling administrative expenses 
however  the timing and extent of future legal costs associated with the ongoing enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights are not readily predictable and may significantly increase in the future 
interest and other  net in thousands change change interest income and other    percentage of revenue the company earns interest income on its cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
the amount of interest earned is a function of the balance of cash invested as well as prevailing interest rates 
the company incurred interest expense on the million convertible subordinated notes  which were fully converted in february the company s investment portfolio contains tax advantaged municipal securities  which had pretax yields that were less than the interest rate on the convertible subordinated notes 
for financial reporting purposes  the company effectively recorded the difference between the pretax and tax equivalent yields as a reduction in provision for taxes on income 
average cash and investment balances decreased slightly from the prior year while interest rates increased moderately keeping interest income constant from fiscal to fiscal the increase in interest and other income in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense related to the redemption of the convertible notes in fiscal offset partially by the increase in foreign currency exchange losses from million in foreign exchange gains in the prior year to million foreign exchange losses in fiscal in  average cash and investment balances and average interest rates remained fairly consistent with the prior year  resulting in comparable net interest and other income in both years 
the amount of net interest and other income in the future will continue to be impacted by the level of the company s average cash and investment balance  prevailing interest rates  the balance of any debt outstanding  and foreign currency exchange rates 
provision for income taxes in thousands change change provision for taxes on income    effective tax rate the tax rates from fiscal through fiscal were favorably impacted by legislation reinstating the r d tax credit 
furthermore  increased profits in foreign operations where the tax rate is lower than the us rate combined with lower state taxes favorably impacted the company s tax rates 
joint venture equity income the company records its proportional ownership of the net income loss of united silicon inc usic  a wafer fabrication joint venture located in taiwan  as joint venture equity income loss 
the fiscal net loss was a result of the continued ramp up in production of the wafer fabrication facility 
the net income in fiscal was primarily attributable to foreign exchange gains as well as interest earned on its investment portfolio 
many of the expenses associated with full foundry operations are being incurred although the facility has not reached full production 
inflation to date  the effects of inflation upon the company s financial results have not been significant 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company s financial condition as of march  continued to be strong with total current assets exceeding total current liabilities by times 
at march   total current assets exceeded total current liabilities by times 
the company has used a combination of equity and debt financing and cash flow from operations to support on going business activities  secure acquisitions and investments in complementary technologies  obtain facilities and capital equipment and finance inventory and accounts receivable 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments xilinx s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million in as the company continued to generate positive cash flows from operations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments represented of total assets at march  the company generated cash flow of million from operating activities in  offset by million of cash used for investing activities and million used in financing activities 
investing activities during fiscal included the net purchase of investments  expenditures for property  plant and equipment  an additional investment in the usic joint venture  and certain assets purchased from mi acquisition llp 
financing activities during included million to acquire treasury stock offset by million in proceeds from sales of common stock under employee option and stock purchase plans 
receivables receivables increased from million at the end of to million at the end of days sales outstanding at the end of and were both days 
the consistency in days sales outstanding was primarily a result of the increase in domestic sales through distribution where some distributors received discounts for prompt payment 
inventories inventories decreased from million at march to million at march inventory levels at march  represent days of inventory compared to days at march  inventory levels decreased during fiscal due to higher than expected shipments and increased focus on supply chain management in addition to both architecture and manufacturing process technology improvements that have permitted continued cost reductions 
the company seeks to balance two competing objectives with regard to inventory management 
on the one hand  the company believes that its standard  off the shelf products should be available for prompt shipment to customers 
accordingly  it attempts to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product  package and speed configurations to meet anticipated customer demand 
on the other hand  the company also wishes to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to realize fully the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements 
the company continually strives to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost 
property  plant and equipment during  xilinx invested million in property and equipment  as compared to million in primary investments in fiscal were for software development tools and semiconductor design  test and manufacturing equipment at each of its manufacturing locations 
current liabilities current liabilities increased from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors 
this is a result of the accounting change  under which the company now defers revenue from international distributors in addition to domestic distributors until the distributor ships the product to an end customer 
long term debt and lines of credit in fiscal  the company converted in full million of convertible subordinated notes due notes for a total of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the company has credit facilities for up to million of which million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements for the company s ireland manufacturing facility 
at march  and  no borrowings were outstanding under the lines of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity stockholders equity grew by in to million 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to million in net income  million related to the issuance of common stock from the employee stock plan and the tax benefit from stock options  and million related to the issuance of common stock from the debt conversion partially offset by the million used to acquire treasury stock 
summary of liquidity the company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash needs for the foreseeable future 
however  the risk factors discussed in item could affect the company s cash positions adversely 
the company will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity  procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities  development of new products  and potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that would complement the company s businesses and may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes 
factors affecting future operating results the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  intense competition and cyclical market patterns 
cyclical market patterns are characterized by several factors  including reduced product demand  limited visibility of demand for products beyond three to nine months  accelerated erosion of average selling prices  and volatile capacity availability 
our results of operations are affected by several factors 
these factors include general economic conditions  conditions specific to technology companies and to the semiconductor industry in particular  decreases in average selling prices over the life of particular products and the timing of new product introductions by us  our competitors and others 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by the ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely manner  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors  the impact of new technologies which result in rapid escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep declines in demand for others  and the inability to predict the success of our customers products into their markets 
market demand for our products  particularly for those most recently introduced  can be difficult to predict  especially in light of customers demands to shorten product lead times and minimize inventory levels 
unpredictable market demand could lead to revenue volatility if we were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products in a given quarter 
in addition  any difficulty in achieving targeted wafer production yields could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  the dynamics of the market make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
due to these and other factors  our past results  including those described in this report  are much less reliable predictors of the future than with companies in many older  more stable and less dynamic industries 
based on the factors noted herein  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results 
our future success depends in a large part on the continued service of our key technical  sales  marketing and management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
particularly important are those highly skilled design  process  software and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
sales and operations outside of the united states subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries 
specifically  we have sales and operations in southeast asia and japan 
the recent economic weakness in these markets has adversely affected revenues and may continue to impact those markets in several ways 
customers may face reduced access to capital and exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect their ability to purchase our products 
in addition  our ability to sell at competitive prices may be diminished 
this instability may increase credit risks as the continued weakness of certain asian currencies may impair our customers ability to repay existing obligations 
depending on the recovery in asia in coming quarters  any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the near future 
our financial condition and results of operations are becoming increasingly dependent on a global economy 
the increased instability in worldwide economic environments could lead to a contraction of capital spending 
additional risks to us include government regulation of exports  imposition of tariffs and other potential trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and generally longer receivable collection periods 
our business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import or export of semiconductor products 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future or what effect  if any  such actions would have on our financial condition and results of operations 
many of our operations are centered in an area of california that has been seismically active 
should there be a major earthquake in this area  our operations may be disrupted 
this type of disruption could result in our inability to ship products in a timely manner  thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
the securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
dependence upon independent manufacturers and subcontractors we do not manufacture the wafers used for our products 
during the past several years  most of our wafers have been manufactured by umc and seiko epson corporation seiko epson  with recent wafers also manufactured by usic 
we have depended upon these suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes which include transitioning to advanced manufacturing process technologies  producing wafers at acceptable yields and delivering them in a timely manner 
while the timeliness  yield and quality of wafer deliveries have met our requirements to date  we cannot assure that our wafer suppliers will not experience future manufacturing problems  including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies 
additionally  disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason  including natural disasters such as fires  floods  or earthquakes  as well as disruptions to access to adequate supplies of electricity  natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly services 
any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or assembly services with competitive performance and cost attributes  adequate yields or timely delivery  or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply  could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our growth will depend in a large part upon our ability to obtain increased wafer fabrication capacity and assembly services from suppliers that are cost competitive 
we consider various alternatives in order to secure additional wafer capacity 
these alternatives include  without limitation  equity investments in  or loans  deposits  or other financial commitments to independent wafer manufacturers 
we also consider the use of contracts which commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
we are currently able to obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner 
however  at times we have been unable  and may in the future be unable  to fully satisfy customer demand because of production constraints  including the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials and services to satisfy customer delivery dates  as well as our ability to process products for shipment 
in addition  a significant increase in general industry demand or any interruption of supply could reduce our supply of wafers or increase our cost of such wafers 
these events could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on new products our future success depends in a large part on our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products which address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price  density  functionality and performance 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion of new product designs  our ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies  achieving acceptable yields  the availability of supporting software design tools  utilization of predefined cores of logic  and market acceptance 
we cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successful or that our new products will achieve market acceptance 
revenues relating to our mature products are expected to continue to decline in the future 
as a result  we will be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from newer products along with cost reductions on current products 
we rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and other price performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins 
to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner  or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
competition see competition discussion in item intellectual property we rely upon patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
we cannot assure that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors  have asserted patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
we cannot assure that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future  that assertions by third parties will not result in costly litigation or that we would prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
computer information systems in order to compete effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change  intense competition and cyclical market patterns  we continually evaluate our computer information systems 
as a result  we have recently implemented new computer information systems or system enhancements relating to our semiconductor manufacturing  software manufacturing  order entry processing and financial applications 
like most other companies using computer information systems in their operations  we are currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by our computerized information systems  as well as the vendor and customer date sensitive computerized information electronically transferred to us 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
any of our systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a year ending in as rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations  classification errors or system failures 
we have performed a thorough review of our internal use software and hardware applications and software products in order to identify those applications and products that are not year compliant 
currently  our year efforts have been focused on final year integrated verification for the software and hardware applications identified in the review in addition to those newly implemented or enhanced 
we are also placing additional emphasis on finalizing the assessment of our outside suppliers and other critical business partners for which initial assessments were incomplete 
we believe that our internal computer system implementation or enhancement efforts principally conducted to improve competitive and operating efficiencies  as described above  have also addressed some of our internal year compliance issues 
additional internal information systems are also currently being upgraded 
electronic data interchange modifications have been completed that are intended to ensure all dates are handled properly  although we cannot assure that all dates will be handled properly 
with regard to all information technology hardware  including desktops  servers  networking and telecom equipment  we have completed our assessments  are making the necessary upgrades and expect to complete the upgrades by mid calendar  although we cannot assure these upgrades will be completed as scheduled 
we believe that our latest software release  version m  is year compliant  although we cannot assure that it is year compliant 
however  some of our customers are running product versions that are not year compliant 
we have been encouraging such customers to migrate to the current product version 
we plan to take several steps to minimize any year effects  including miscalculations  classification errors or system failures 
our internal preparedness includes specific steps that will be taken in anticipation of the year in addition  we are relying on a contingency plan which has been developed and is now being implemented which includes manual workarounds  attention to inventory levels  the ability to utilize both our san jose and ireland manufacturing facilities for shipment and having multiple vendors who can provide critical services  wafer assembly as well as test products 
the costs directed solely towards year compliance are not incremental to us  but rather represent a reallocation of existing resources 
to date  we have incurred less than million on efforts directed solely towards year compliance and expect to incur a total of less than million when the process is completed  although we cannot assure that this will be the case 
the costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
if  however  we  our customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues on a timely  cost effective basis  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the statements above represent forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those described above due to a number of risk factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to the complexity of identifying potential year issues  our ability to allocate and or obtain qualified resources to resolve year issues  our ability to work effectively with vendors and other critical business partners  and our effectiveness at encouraging customers to migrate towards our current software product version 
we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully modify all systems and products to comply with year requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we were to discontinue our year preparedness at this time  we would not be able to ensure all internal networks and desktops were operational  nor ensure third party vendors were able to meet our inventory demands or send information electronically 
in addition  disruptions to the economy generally resulting from the year issues could also materially adversely impact us 
we could be subject to litigation for computer system failures such as equipment shutdowns or failure to properly date business records 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of potential liability and lost revenue 
euro currency beginning in  member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
during the three year transition  the euro will be available for non cash transactions and legacy currencies will remain legal tender 
we are continuing to assess the euro s impact on our business 
we are reviewing the ability of our accounting and information systems to handle the conversion  the ability of foreign banks to report on dual currencies  the legal and contractual implications of agreements  as well as reviewing our pricing strategies 
we expect that any additional modifications to our operations and systems will be completed on a timely basis and do not believe the conversion will have a material adverse impact on our operations 
however  we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully modify all systems and contracts to comply with euro requirements 
litigation we are currently engaged in several legal matters 
see legal proceedings in item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item item a 
market rate risks interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s primary aim with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
the portfolio includes tax advantaged municipal bonds  tax advantaged auction rate preferred municipal bonds  certificates of deposit  and us treasury securities 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  the company places investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in a million less than decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities as of the end of fiscal and in addition  the company has historically had the ability and has the intent to hold its securities until maturity and therefore  does not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows  although there can be no assurance of this 
until the conversion of the long term debt to equity in fiscal  the company also had a liability interest rate exposure which was mitigated through the use of a liability interest rate swap agreement 
foreign currency risk the company uses forward currency exchange contracts to reduce financial market risks 
the company s sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen while its purchases of processed silicon wafers from japanese foundries are primarily denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transactions are settled 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria would be recognized in income in the current period 
a adverse change in yen exchange rates based on historical average rate fluctuations would have had approximately a adverse impact on revenue for fiscal years and in fiscal  the company has also begun to share the yen exchange rate risk with some of its japanese customers through risk sharing agreements 
as the company will continue to have a net yen exposure in the near future  it will continue to mitigate the exposure through yen hedging contracts 
however  no forward currency contracts were outstanding as of march the company has several subsidiaries and an equity investment in the usic joint venture whose financial statements are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency financial statements are translated at each month end during consolidation  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
if permanent changes occur in exchange rates after an investment is made  the investment s value will increase or decrease accordingly 
these fluctuations are recorded as a component of stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
to date  the usic joint venture has recorded million in cumulative translation adjustments  as the new taiwan dollar has decreased in value against the us dollar 
also  as the company s subsidiaries and the usic joint venture maintain investments denominated in other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur
