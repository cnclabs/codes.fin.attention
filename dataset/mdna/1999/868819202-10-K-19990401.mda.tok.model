item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net sales registrant s net sales of contact laser tm systems are primarily comprised of contact laser delivery systems and related accessories and nd yag laser systems 
the u 
s market is serviced predominantly by a direct sales force  while sales outside the united states are derived through a network of distributors 
in  net sales were  a decrease of  or  from sales of  the sales of  increased  or from sales of  net sales of contact laser delivery systems and related accessories  which comprised of registrant s net sales in  declined and in and  respectively  due to the lower level of sales of nd yag laser systems and to lower sales primarily within the urology market  offsetting increases in sales within the ent and neurosurgical markets where registrant is currently concentrating its sales efforts 
net sales of nd yag laser systems  which comprised of registrant s net sales in  decreased by on a decline in units 
the decrease in laser system sales was attributable to both domestic hospital budget constraints and to the effect of the asian economic situation which rendered certain distributors unable to secure funding for planned purchases 
in  the overall average unit selling price of an nd yag laser system remained consistant as compared to net sales of nd yag laser systems in was relatively constant with  despite an increase of in unit sales 
unit sales of new nd yag laser systems in remained relatively constant with  while sales of used and demonstration laser systems accounted for the percentage increase in unit sales 
the increase in unit sales was due to both a higher volume of sales of registrant s laser systems for ent surgery as well as registrant s continuing efforts to reduce demonstration laser inventory levels through a reduction in average unit prices 
as a result  in the overall average unit selling price of an nd yag laser system declined by as compared to in october  following the acquisition of the remaining interest in the mediq prn slt joint venture see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  revenues from the rental of registrant s nd yag laser systems and related contact laser delivery systems and accessories began to be included in net sales 
in and  respectively  rental revenue accounted for and of net sales 
all other revenue  including contract development activities  accounted for of net sales in and there were no contract development activities in management will continue to invest in innovative product development and will continue to develop and expand its strategic business relationships while actively pursuing business combination or acquisition opportunities aimed at enhancing the generation of new revenues and increasing shareholder value 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended january  decreased  or from the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was  down from in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from the inclusion in of initial contract development fees with no direct cost for which there were no comparable fees in gross profit for the year ended december  was constant with the prior year on a increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was  down from in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due primarily to three factors 
the main factor was a reduction in the selling price on certain contact laser systems  enacted in an effort to reduce inventory levels 
the second factor was the inclusion in all of of the laser oncall tm rental business which operated at a lower percentage gross profit as compared to the sale of lasers and delivery systems 
a partial offset to those two factors was the higher percentage gross profit realized from contract development activities in for which there were no corresponding activities in operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were  in  compared to  in  a decrease of 
the comparative decrease was due primarily to significantly lower legal fees in due to the settlement in of two outstanding lawsuits 
in  registrant continued to reduce operating expenses where appropriate relative to the lower level of net sales being experienced 
management expects to continue to monitor expense levels throughout  making adjustments where warranted 
selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased from the level of  due mainly to cost reduction actions taken in the third quarter of such actions included reductions in workforce and related employee expenses and a reduction in the operating costs due to the consolidation of registrant s facilities into one location 
also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in legal fees 
product development product development costs were   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in versus was due principally to increased manpower and other expenditures associated with registrant s private label and ent and neurosurgery product development efforts 
non recurring charges credits in  registrant recorded a non recurring charge related to the impending sale of slt s former headquarters facility in oaks  pennsylvania  which is expected to close before the end of june the charge consisted of a  write down of the asset necessitated by the terms of the impending sale and  in accrued closing costs 
in  registrant recorded a benefit from the settlement of litigation with cr bard and the bard urological division of  in addition  registrant recorded non recurring facility related charges of  related to registrant s former headquarters facility and  related to registrant s former manufacturing facility in kentucky 
the  charge resulted from a write down in the carrying value of the former headquarters facility necessitated by the terms under which the facility was expected to be sold at the end of the tenant s initial sublease term 
the  charge resulted from the loss of registrant s former subtenant and subsequent signing of a new subtenant at a lower rental rate 
in  registrant recorded non recurring charges of  representing third quarter restructuring charges of  for severance and other related costs  and a charge of  for the write off of leasehold improvements at registrant s former leased manufacturing facility in oaks  pennsylvania 
the manufacturing operations have been consolidated with all other operations into registrant s leased facility in montgomeryville  pennsylvania 
other income other income primarily consisted of facility related income and expense items 
other income was  in and  in  an increase of  in  other income increased to  from a loss in of  this increase resulted from the inclusion of a full year of sublease income in as compared to only six months of sublease income in and the inclusion of a charge to other income in of moving expenses to relocate registrant s headquarters for which there were no corresponding costs in interest net interest expense in of  was relatively constant with net interest expense of  in net interest expense of  in increased by  from  in the increase was due to the inclusion of a full year of interest expense on the capital leases acquired in the purchase of the mediq prn slt joint venture offset in part by higher interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in income taxes the tax provision in and of  and  respectively  was for state income taxes 
there was no provision for income taxes in due to the net taxable loss incurred 
registrant expects that its effective tax rate for will remain significantly lower than the statutory rate due to continued availability of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
medtrek agreement in  registrant acquired exclusive worldwide rights to certain new products and medical devices used in minimally invasive otolaryngology and head and neck ent surgery  pursuant to an agreement with medtrek corporation and its president  mr 
dom l 
gatto 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  registrant was required to make cash payments to medtrek when certain products were commercially introduced and has issued stock warrants to medtrek that will vest when and if predetermined revenue targets are achieved 
during  slt concluded that certain products under the agreement would not be commercialized 
as a result  the net value of the agreement and any remaining liabilities associated with these products were written off in december also  since these products will not be commercialized  it is improbable that the predetermined revenue targets necessary to vest the warrants will be achieved 
therefore  in december  slt wrote off the value of the warrants see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at january  were  a decrease of  over the december  balance of  registrant invests its excess cash in high quality  liquid  short term investments 
in each of the two years   was restricted and pledged in favor of american united life insurance company aulic as a condition of the first mortgage with aulic see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at january  and december   letters of credit  issued under registrant s bank line of credit  were outstanding in favor of the montgomery county industrial development corporation mcidc as a condition of the security agreement with mcidc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the letters of credit amounted to  and  at the end of and  respectively 
the letter of credit requirement and the restricted cash requirement are expected to be eliminated with the sale of the facility 
registrant has a  credit facility with a bank 
this facility includes a sub line for letters of credit of  under which the aforementioned letters of credit were issued 
other than the letter of credit requirement by mcidc  and one other minor letter of credit  there were no borrowings under the credit facility during or borrowings under the credit facility are secured by registrant s accounts receivable and inventories 
the credit facility is subject to registrant maintaining certain financial covenants as defined 
management expects to renew a line of credit facility when this facility expires on may  in  net cash provided by operating activities was  which resulted principally from losses incurred of  offset by net non cash adjustments of  and a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory of  and  respectively 
the net non cash adjustments of  included non recurring charges of  net cash provided by operating activities was  in  primarily resulting from net non cash adjustments of  a decrease in accounts receivable of  partially offset by the net loss incurred of  coupled with a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  the net non cash adjustments of  included non recurring charges of  the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities included royalty payments of  to norio daikuzono in connection with the settlement of litigation 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in compared to cash used in investing activities of  in the increase was principally due to the maturity of certain short term investments of  during compared to the purchase of certain short term investments of  during net cash used in financing activities was  in  compared to net cash used in financing activities of  in the increase was principally the result of stock warrants issued in of  of which there was no comparable issuance in management believes that registrant s current cash position and available line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations and meet its commitments for long term debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  other commitments and contingencies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and capital expenditures 
in july  registrant s subordinated convertible debentures will mature 
management believes that its cash position will be sufficient to meet this obligation 
management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on operations for the three years in the period ended january  year compliance registrant has analyzed its information technology systems for the year compliance issues 
management believes that the year issue related to registrant s hardware and software programs are not likely to result in any material adverse disruptions in registrant s computer systems or its internal business operations 
registrant has purchased the latest version of its operating software package to provide remediation for the year issue 
the costs of this new software was  and testing and implementation is to be completed by the third quarter of registrant has analyzed and determined that the year issue related to its non information technology  such as its telephone and security system  are not likely to result in any material disruption of it business operations 
registrant is currently in the process of evaluating its relationships with third parties  such as banks  service providers and suppliers  with which registrant has a direct and material relationship to determine whether they are year compliant 
the responses received to date from such third parties to inquiries made by registrant indicate that these third parties either are or expect to be compliant by the year even assuming that all material third parties confirm that they are or expect to be year compliant by december   it is not possible to state with certainty that such parties will be so compliant  or that the operations of such third parties will not be materially impacted by other parties with whom they themselves have a material relationship  and who fail to timely become year compliant 
consequently  it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent the year issues may have an adverse material impact on registrant as a result of their impact on the operations of the third parties with whom registrant has a material relationship 
for example  the failure to be year compliant by a bank with whom registrant has a material banking relationship could cause significant disruption in registrant s ability to make payments  deposit funds and make investments  which could have a material adverse effect on registrant s financial condition 
registrant has not established a contingency plan in case of failure of its information technology systems since it expects to have its new software system in place by the third quarter of registrant will continuously monitor its relationships with banks  service providers and suppliers to ensure they expect to be year compliant 
if registrant learns that one of these third parties will not be year compliant  registrant s contingency plan would include replacing such third party

changes in the us health care system 
there has been substantial debate in the political arena related to prospective changes in the us health care system 
in addition  developments in both the public and the private sector have significantly affected the financing and delivery of health care in the united states  including the rapid expansion of managed care programs  the reduction of reimbursements under the capital cost pass through system for the medicare program and the implementation of prospective governmental reimbursement programs based on diagnostic related groups 
cost containment has been a major element of these developments  which have had a material adverse effect on registrant s results of operations over the past several years 
there can be no assurance that such changes in the financing and delivery of health care will not continue to affect hospital capital equipment and supplies procurement patterns or dictate which surgical procedures will be covered by applicable insurance or government funded or subsidized programs  which could continue to have a material adverse impact on registrant 
registrant also cannot predict the extent or impact of future legislation or regulations 
competition 
registrant faces substantial competition from conventional surgical methods  from other manufacturers of surgical lasers and from manufacturers of alternatives to surgical lasers 
competitive pressure could result in price competition or the introduction of new products by registrant s competitors  which could have an adverse impact on registrant s revenues and results of operations 
in addition  registrant is engaged in an industry characterized by extensive research efforts 
advances in medical lasers which improve clinical effectiveness and other discoveries or developments in either the medical device or drug industry could render registrant s products obsolete 
some of the companies with which registrant competes or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater financial  technical and personnel resources than registrant and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
governmental regulation 
government regulation in the us and other countries is a significant factor in the development  manufacturing and marketing of many of registrant s products and in registrant s ongoing research and development activities 
specifically  medical devices are subject to united states food and drug administration fda approval or clearance before they can be utilized for clinical studies or sold commercially 
the process for obtaining the necessary approvals and compliance with applicable regulations can be costly and time consuming 
there can be no assurance that regulatory review will not involve delays or other actions adversely affecting the marketing and sales of registrant s products 
registrant has received all of its fda clearances to date using the procedure under section k 
there is no assurance registrant will continue to be able to obtain applicable government approvals or successfully comply with such regulations in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  and failure to do so may have an adverse effect on registrant s financial condition and results of operation 
further  there can be no assurances that more stringent regulatory requirements and or safety and quality standards will not be issued in the future with an adverse effect on registrant s business 
although registrant believes that it is in compliance with all applicable regulations of the fda  current regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect registrant 
registrant s products are similarly subject to foreign regulating bodies 
typically  foreign bodies readily allow registrant s products to be traded within their jurisdictions  based on the fact that registrant s products have secured clearance from the fda 
however  there can be no assurance that such foreign bodies will not impose different  additional requirements that may materially hamper registrant s ability to compete in overseas markets 
patents and proprietary technologies 
registrant s ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on its ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of its technology 
registrant owns fourteen united states patents  several japanese patents and a number of issued foreign patents and pending patent applications for its products 
registrant treats its design and technical data as confidential  and relies on nondisclosure safeguards  such as confidentiality agreements  laws protecting trade secrets and agreements to protect proprietary information 
registrant has incurred substantial costs in enforcing its patents against infringement by others and defending itself against similar claims of others 
although registrant has been successful to date in disputes involving the validity and enforceability of its patents and in defending itself against claims by others of patent infringement  there can be no assurance that registrant will continue to be successful in such matters in the future or that registrant s patents or other proprietary rights  even if continuing to be held valid  will be broad enough in scope to enable registrant to prevent third parties from producing products using similar technologies or processes 
as registrant attempts to broaden its offerings in ent and  to a lesser extent  in other surgical fields  registrant perceives that it may be obliged to license technology from third parties in order to have competitive offerings 
there can be no assurance that registrant will be successful in obtaining such licenses on terms satisfactory to registrant 
product development and acquisitions 
registrant is actively engaged in identifying market needs and in developing products to satisfy those unmet needs 
such products are not necessarily laser products 
registrant attempts to validate the existence of such unmet needs as well as the potential revenues  costs and profits involved in satisfying such needs 
there is a material risk that registrant s competitors may satisfy those needs with more effective or less expensive products 
there is also a material risk that registrant s estimates of the economic potential from such unmet needs may be incomplete or inaccurate  or that the products which registrant develops to meet such needs will be untimely introduced or insufficiently effective clinically or economically to gain market acceptance 
registrant seeks to expand its product offerings through both internal development and acquisition of products and or companies 
no assurance can be given that registrant will be successful in carrying out an acquisition strategy or that if an acquisition is made that the acquisition will be successfully integrated and result in increased revenues and profits 
change in marketing approach 
registrant is taking  or is contemplating taking  certain actions to transition its marketing approach from addressing a wide range of surgical specialties to providing a broader array of products to a more select market segment 
although registrant believes that this transition will have a long term positive financial impact  no assurance can be given that the actions taken will provide the intended results  or that registrant will not experience short term disruptions or an adverse impact of operations during the transition to this new marketing approach 
nasdaq listing requirements 
registrant s common stock is traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in  nasdaq modified its listing requirements with which registrant was required to comply in order to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market 
in january  registrant requested and received nasdaq s approval to move the market in which the common stock is traded from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market  due primarily to the registrant s inability to satisfy the minimum public float requirement for the nasdaq national market 
although registrant s stock price has remained above nasdaq s minimum bid requirement since the one for five reverse split of the common stock was implemented in january  no assurance can be given that the bid price of registrant s common stock will remain above the minimum  or that registrant will continue to meet the other listing requirements required by the nasdaq smallcap market
