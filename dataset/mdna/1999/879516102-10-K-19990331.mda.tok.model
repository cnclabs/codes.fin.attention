year readiness the potential problems referred to as year or yk result from systems using only two digits to indicate the year in a date and thereby not being able to distinguish between january  and january  in addition  certain systems may fail to detect that the year is a leap year 
the yk issue affects the company s internal systems  including information technology it and non it systems 
to evaluate these systems  the company has organized a task force to address software  hardware network  pc and third party data and communication provider issues 
the task force has created a comprehensive action plan to assess and evaluate current systems and is currently implementing replacements and modifications where necessary 
the final phase of the action plan includes thoroughly testing systems and developing contingency plans as specific problems are identified 
the company has substantially completed the assessment phase of its internal hardware and software applications and is in the process of upgrading or replacing non compliant systems in the course of upgrading the computer hardware 
the company has not accelerated the replacement dates for non compliant equipment  and the cost of upgrading non compliant equipment was previously included in the company s planned capital expenditures 
the company currently intends to complete its replacement and modification phase for internal hardware and software applications in the second quarter of the company believes its host system  which is considered by management to be the company s critical system  is yk compliant since this system has control logic based on binary julian dates rather than the two digit format 
the company is currently testing its host system to ensure that it is yk compliant 
furthermore  the company expects that all phases of yk compliance can be accomplished with current staffing levels 
to date  no yk remediation costs have been expensed and future costs  which are expected to be minimal  will not be reflected in the financial statements until incurred 
the company s internet and online services are highly dependent upon outside communication and third party data providers 
the company has compiled a list of critical providers and vendors  which approximates  and is contacting them to assess and monitor their compliance and remediation efforts 
the company cannot currently identify whether all yk issues resulting from outside communication and third party data providers will be resolved 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is the failure of one or more outside communication or third party data provider to be yk compliant 
such failure could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to replace such outside communication or third party data  if needed  to maintain the company s products and services at expected levels  which action could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company anticipates being available to determine the worst case scenarios by june  as the company s testing phases of internal hardware and software applications are completed and the assessments of outside communication and third party data providers are received  the company will develop an applicable contingency plan for yk issues 
the contingency plan to react to the worst case scenario should be developed by the company no later than the end of july
