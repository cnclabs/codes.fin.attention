item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to such consolidated financial statements also included in this form k 
some of the information that follows are not statements of historical fact  and reflect our intent  belief or expectations regarding the anticipated effect of events  circumstances and trends 
such statements should be considered as forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include uncertainty of future profitability and cash generation from operations  manufacturing delays while awaiting regulatory approval for our new manufacturing facility  uncertainty of clinical trial results for our products under development  uncertainty of market acceptance of our products by the worldwide medical community  risks inherent in international transactions  including those relating to our expansion in europe  brazil and elsewhere  our limited sales and marketing experience  the extent of future expenditures for sales and marketing programs  dependence on third party reimbursement from government entities  managed care organizations  and private insurance plans  dependence on abbott laboratories as our principal european distributor  delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for our products in development  uncertainty regarding patents and proprietary rights in connection with our products  our ability to obtain requisite additional financing to fund our operations beyond calendar  and other factors as set forth under the caption additional considerations beginning on page overview we develop  manufacture and market our patented hybrid capture r gene analysis system and tests  and we are commercializing these hybrid capture products in three areas women s health testing  blood virus testing  and pharmaceutical clinical research 
our primary focus is in women s health where our lead product is the only fda approved dna test for human papillomavirus  or hpv  which is associated with more than of cervical cancers 
we are the world s leading supplier of hpv tests 
our hybrid capture ii hpv test received pma marketing approval from the fda in march internationally  our portfolio of women s health tests is now cleared for sale in almost every major european country and in brazil and argentina 
our objective in the women s health area is to become the world leader in gene based testing for women s cancers and infectious diseases 
we have also developed a family of unique blood virus testing products based on our hybrid capture system including tests for cytomegalovirus cmv and hepatitis b 
our cmv test is the only cmv dna test cleared by the fda  we received k clearance in october internationally  we are working to establish our hpv test as the standard for cervical cancer screening 
pursuant to a marketing and distribution agreement that became effective in may  our women s health and blood virus tests are marketed in europe by abbott laboratories and  once fda clearance is received  our chlamydia and gonorrhea tests will be marketed by abbott laboratories in the united states 
we currently market our hybrid capture products in the united states through a direct sales force supported by technical and customer service representatives 
in the united states  we are currently marketing our hpv test for the follow up screening of women with equivocal pap smears 
in the pharmaceutical clinical research market we are using the unique capabilities of our hybrid capture system to provide us access to complimentary early stage technologies and to link our tests with novel therapeutics and vaccines 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since inception  resulting principally from expenses associated with our research and development programs  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory submissions for our products and the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and our global sales and marketing activities 
we expect such operating losses to continue at least through fiscal as we continue our product development efforts  seek fda and foreign regulatory approvals of our products  expand our manufacturing capabilities and expand our sales and marketing activities 
in march  we entered into a lease agreement for a new facility where we will consolidate our research and development facility  our corporate office and our manufacturing facility into one location in gaithersburg  maryland  to which we expect to relocate in december this new facility will result in increased operating expenses 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we believe that they may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future with lower product revenues in the first and second fiscal quarters as compared with the third and fourth fiscal quarters  primarily attributable to the lower demand for certain women s health related medical procedures during the summer months in the united states and europe  and during the december holiday season 
in addition  our quarterly operating results  as well as annual results  may fluctuate from period to period due to the degree of market acceptance of our products  competition  the timing of regulatory approvals and other regulatory announcements  the volume and timing of orders from and shipments to distributors  variations in our distribution channels  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors  product obsolescence resulting from new product introductions and other factors  many of which are outside our control 
due to one or more of these factors  in one or more future quarters our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased sales of our hybrid capture tests  primarily hpv tests and related equipment  partially offset by lower sales of our non core products 
we anticipate that sales of our hpv tests will account for a substantial portion of our product sales for at least the next two fiscal years 
research and development contract revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to our performance during the entire fiscal year under a major research contract with the national institutes of health for the development of tests for herpes simplex virus 
we anticipate that fiscal research and development contract revenues will remain approximately the same as they were in fiscal cost of product sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to increased sales volume 
gross margin on product sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin equipment and increased write offs for inventory obsolescence  partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies and product pricing 
we expect gross margins to fluctuate moderately based on product mix in the coming years 
research and development expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to reductions in expenditures for clinical trials and laboratory supplies  partially offset by higher personnel costs 
we expect research and development expenses to increase moderately for the next few fiscal years 
selling and marketing expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to increases in european sales and marketing programs  partially offset by decreases in expenditures in the united states associated with lower personnel costs 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to decrease over the next fiscal year as a result of the marketing and distribution activities performed in europe  the middle east and africa by abbott under our marketing and distribution agreement rather than through the expansion of a digene sales and marketing force in those areas 
thereafter  we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase moderately for the following few fiscal years 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to costs associated with the planned december move to our new facility in gaithersburg  maryland  as well as increases in professional services expense  partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase moderately for the following few fiscal years 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to the write off of certain intangible assets in fiscal  partially offset by amortization expense attributable to goodwill associated with our acquisition of viropath  bv on july  we expect amortization of intangible assets to remain constant in the next fiscal year 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to the repayment in december of debt incurred in february interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances primarily as a result of negative cash flows from operations 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased sales of our hybrid capture tests  primarily hpv  partially offset by lower sales of equipment and non core products 
research and development contract revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to substantial completion of contract activities during fiscal cost of product sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to increased sales volume 
gross margin on product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was due primarily to sales of higher margin hybrid capture tests and increases in overhead absorption and unit pricing 
research and development expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the hiring of additional research and development personnel and increases in clinical trial activity related to the development of our blood virus and sexually transmitted disease tests and to the further development of our hybrid capture technology 
selling and marketing expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to substantial increases in sales and marketing programs  the hiring of additional selling and marketing personnel  and other selling costs incurred under our international distribution agreements 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel  and costs associated with our expansion into the european and brazilian markets 
amortization of intangible assets increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to debt incurred in february as a result of our expansion into the european market 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances as a result of negative cash flows from operations  partially offset by the interest income generated by the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of our common stock in october the  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is a result of the early adoption of statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
the write off of the unamortized balance of capitalized costs was incurred in connection with our acquisition of hpv customer lists under our agreements with international murex technologies corporation to establish a digene direct european sales operation for our women s health products 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  our expenses have significantly exceeded our revenues  resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately million at june  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
at june   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregating approximately  net cash used in our operating activities was  for the fiscal year ended june  capital expenditures decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to changes in our distribution agreements requiring a smaller investment in equipment 
in march  we entered into a lease agreement for a new facility in gaithersburg  maryland  to which we expect to relocate in december the integration of our operations into this new facility may result initially in inefficiencies and delays 
specifically  we may encounter difficulties in expanding and or moving our manufacturing operations 
we do not have any bank financing arrangements 
we anticipate that working capital requirements will increase moderately for the foreseeable future due to increasing accounts receivable as a result of expected revenue growth 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts  expand our sales and marketing activities and expand our manufacturing capabilities 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations through calendar we cannot give assurances that we will not need to consume a significant amount of our available resources more rapidly than we presently anticipate 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including the successful commercialization of our products  progress in our product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  progress in our regulatory affairs activities  the cost and timing of expansion of our manufacturing capabilities  the development and maintenance of effective sales and marketing activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of our products 
to the extent that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
although we expect to seek additional equity financing  we do not have any committed sources of additional financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
on july   we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of viropath bv  a company with limited liability registered in amsterdam  the netherlands  for total consideration of  shares of our common stock 
in addition  we are obligated to pay royalties  not to exceed  on future sales of viropath s licensed hpv products in the field of cervical cancer testing 
we also granted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the three viropath individual shareholders in connection with their execution of consulting agreements with us 
the options were compensatory options and were valued on july  at approximately  this amount will be expensed ratably over five fiscal years 
year readiness disclosure we are working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the ability of our computerized information programs and systems and certain manufacturing and other equipment to accurately process information that may be date sensitive 
any of our technology that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year could result in errors or system failures 
we have substantially completed an assessment of our manufacturing and research equipment  computer programs and telephone systems and have identified the mission critical equipment  computer programs and systems that were not year compliant  at least of which have been upgraded and vendor certified for year compliance 
we have also tested a majority of such mission critical equipment  computer programs and systems for year compliance 
we expect to complete our upgrade and replacement activities by november and complete the remainder of our testing activities by december during the remainder of calendar  we intend to communicate with our significant raw material and product vendors to determine their respective states of year readiness 
in connection with our planned move to the new facility in gaithersburg  maryland in december  we have upgraded or replaced the mission critical computer programs  systems and manufacturing and other equipment with new computer programs  systems and equipment which the suppliers have certified or will certify to be year compliant 
in anticipation of the possibility that our relocation will not occur in  which we do not expect  we have also made the necessary year related changes to the few systems  such as our existing telephone system  that we do not intend to relocate to the new facility and have developed contingency plans 
we do not expect that continuing our operations in our existing space  if necessary  would be materially impacted by the advent of the year we are in the process of testing our upgraded or replaced computer programs  systems and equipment and will continue the testing throughout the remainder of calendar based on information developed to date as a result of our assessment and testing efforts  we do not anticipate that the total cost of upgrading or replacing our computer programs  systems and equipment will be material 
in anticipation of possible year related failures and possible delays in our manufacturing processes in connection with our planned relocation  we are also formulating contingency plans  including the stockpiling of product inventory during the second quarter of fiscal if we  or any third parties upon which we rely  are unable to address the year issue in a timely and successful manner  our business could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk digene is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our exchange rate risk is limited to our operations in europe and south america 
we do not believe that the impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have a material impact on our financial statements 
the net impact of foreign exchange activities on earnings was immaterial for the years ended june   and interest rate exposure is primarily limited to the million of short term investments owned by us 
such securities are debt instruments which generate interest income for digene on excess cash balances 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term  less than months  nature of these investments 
we do not consider the present rate of inflation to have a significant impact on its business
