the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in the decline in gross margin in fiscal was related mainly to the increase in sales of lcd products  which historically are at a lower margin 
the company intends to record charges related to inventory up to million in the first quarter of such charges are due to a management decision to discontinue certain products and record potential reserves for other products 
this is in line with management s efforts to rationalize the product portfolio 
research and development research and development expenses increased million or to million in from million in the increase is due primarily to additional expenses related to the development of new technologies and product engineering associated with the development of color amlcd products in both the commercial and military avionics businesses 
in addition  the company also received million less in contract funding in as compared to research and development expenses increased in from this increase in fiscal related primarily to lcd development at the company s lcd facility 
increases in net expenses in both years related to continued work on the next generation color products  and technology development on amlcds  feds  amel miniature displays  and organic light emitting diodes oleds 
research and development expenses are expected to decrease in fiscal year due to anticipated reductions in spending 
as a result of these reductions and other cost savings associated with the restructuring charges recorded in  operating expenses are expected to decline to approximately in fiscal as a percentage of sales as compared to in purchased research and development costs purchased research and development costs were million for fiscal these one time  non recurring costs represent in process research and development costs expensed by the company in connection with its acquisition of standish industries  inc sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased  or to million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to additional marketing resources associated with the medical and transportation markets

amortization of goodwill and excess of fair market value of acquired net assets over purchase price in connection with the company s acquisition of standish industries  inc in september  the company recorded goodwill on its balance sheet for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the goodwill is being amortized over a ten year period  resulting in operating expenses of  per year 
in connection with the company s acquisition of its finland operation in january  the company exchanged common stock with a fair market value based upon an independent valuation equivalent to the value of the business acquired 
due to historical losses of this business and the expectation of future losses  the value of the common stock paid was less than the fair market value of the net assets acquired 
this required the company to write fixed assets down to zero and to record negative goodwill on its balance sheet for the remaining amount of the excess fair market value of the net assets acquired over the purchase price 
amortization of this negative goodwill has created a positive offset to operating expenses in the amount of  per year 
negative goodwill is being amortized over a ten year period 
non operating income and expense non operating income and expense includes interest income on investments  interest expense and net foreign currency exchange gain or loss 
net interest income expense decreased from net interest income of  in to net interest expense of  in due to lower cash balances earning interest income and higher interest expense due to increased borrowings 
the company has increased its borrowings to finance equipment purchases associated with a new production facility 
net interest income decreased in from as a result of lower cash balances in  due to the cash paid for the acquisition of standish industries  inc in september  and the retirement of its debt in  and cash used for stock repurchases 
on july   the company acquired a interest in dpix holding company llc 
dpix holding company llc owns of dpix llc 
the company paid million in cash for its interest in dpix holding company llc 
dpix llc manufactures and sells amorphous silicon thin film transistor arrays for use in x ray digital detectors and liquid crystal displays 
the investment has been accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
as part of the acquisition agreement  there is a disproportionate allocation of profit and losses where the company recognizes the first million of losses incurred 
the company has written off the entire investment of million  which includes transaction costs of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the actual losses incurred since the date of acquisition and the belief that the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are related to timing differences in the receipt and payment of funds in various currencies and the conversion of cash accounts denominated in foreign currencies to the applicable functional currency 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses amounted to a gain of million in  a loss of  in and a gain of million in these amounts are comprised of realized gains and losses on cash transactions involving various currencies and unrealized gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated receivables and payables resulting from exchange rate fluctuations between the various currencies in which the company conducts business 
the company currently realizes about one fifth of its revenue outside the united states and expects this to continue in the future 
additionally  the functional currency of the company s foreign subsidiary is the finnish markka which must be translated to us dollars for consolidation 
as such  the effects of future foreign currency fluctuations will impact the company s business and operating results 
the other expense recognized for the fiscal year ended september  reflects the write off of an equity investment in virtual i o  a privately held virtual reality headset manufacturing company 
the investment was accounted for under the cost method 
in december  as a result of delays in product developments and supplier issues  virtual i o needed additional funding which it received at a price per share lower than that paid by the company 
based upon the lower of cost or market method  the company s investment was written down based on the price paid in the last round of independent financing 
virtual i o declared bankruptcy during and the company s investment was written off 
provision for income taxes the company recorded a tax benefit of million in  an effective tax rate of for and a tax benefit of  for the change in the effective tax rate for was due to the relative profitability of the company s finland subsidiary compared to the united states entities 
for fiscal and  the change in the effective tax rates was due to recognition of book losses in the united states compared to book income for the company s finland subsidiary 
in  the book loss in the united states was due primarily to the write off of the dpix investment and the restructuring charges 
in  the book loss in the united states was largely due to the write off of the purchased research and development associated with the acquisition of standish industries  inc as a result of the acquisition of the company s finland subsidiary in january  the company recognized a change in ownership for tax purposes that resulted in a limitation on the annual utilization of net operating loss carryforwards for united states tax purposes 
in fiscal  and  the company was subject to the million annual limitation 
quarterly results of operations the table below presents unaudited consolidated financial results for each quarter in the two year period ended september  the company believes that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements

the increase in was primarily due to the loss on the dpix investment and the restructuring charges offset by the change in deferred taxes and other balance sheet accounts 
the decrease in was primarily related to changes in the balance sheet accounts including inventory  accounts receivable  other current assets and other current liabilities 
additions to plant and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the significant acquisitions during and were purchases of equipment for the wisconsin and finland manufacturing operations 
the principal acquisitions during fiscal were related to the acquisition of equipment to be used in connection with the development of the military flat panel displays and the continued development of amel miniature displays 
the company invested million and million in and  respectively  associated with the implementation of a new production facility and equipment  which had not been placed in service at the end of each fiscal year 
as of september   the equipment had not yet been placed in service 
the company expects to bring its new production facility on line during the second quarter of fiscal at september   the company had two bank lines of credit agreements with a total borrowing capacity of million and credit facilities for financing equipment of million 
as of september  and september   borrowings outstanding under the credit line were and million  respectively 
borrowings outstanding under the equipment financing lines were million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
the company was in violation of certain financial covenants under both lines of credit as of september  the banks have waived the covenant violations 
the company believes its existing cash and investments together with cash generated from operations and existing borrowing capabilities will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
on april   the company announced its intention to repurchase up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock from time to time over the following twelve months in open market and negotiated transactions 
on may   the company announced its intention to repurchase up to an additional million of the company s outstanding common stock from time to time over the following twelve months in open market and negotiated transactions 
during the twelve months ended september   the company repurchased approximately  shares of its outstanding common stock for million 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio  and short term and long term debt obligations 
the company mitigates its risk by diversifying its investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the company believes that its net income or cash flow exposure relating to rate changes for short term and long term debt obligations is not material 
the company primarily enters into debt obligations to support capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures 
interest expense is affected by the general level of us interest rates and or libor 
increases in interest expense resulting from an increase in interest rates would be offset by a corresponding increase in interest earned on the company s investments 
the finnish markka is the functional currency of the company s subsidiary in finland 
the company does not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the company does maintain cash balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar  the company believes that the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would not decline by a material amount 
year issue like most other companies  the year computer issue creates risks for the company 
the year issue exists because many computer programs use two digit rather than four digit date fields to define the applicable year 
as a result  computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  production delays  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue by the company or critically important suppliers or customers of the company could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer systems  software and other operational equipment will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
for this purpose  the term computer systems and software includes systems that are commonly thought of as information technology it systems  including enterprise software  operating systems  networking components  application and data servers  pc hardware  accounting  data processing and other information systems  as well as systems that are not commonly thought of as it systems  such as telephone systems  fax machines  manufacturing equipment and other miscellaneous systems and equipment 
both it and non it systems may contain embedded technology  which complicates the company s year assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
all of the company s financial and information systems are believed to be year compliant 
the company has completed the process of inventorying and assessing its primary manufacturing and other non it systems 
to date  no significant issues have been identified with the company s manufacturing and other non it systems 
the company has surveyed its major vendors  suppliers  and customers to assess the potential impact on its operations of these key third parties 
the process included obtaining information as to their efforts associated with year compliance 
to date  no significant compliance issues have been identified with these third parties 
the company currently estimates that the cost of its year assessment  remediation and testing efforts  as well as current anticipated costs to be incurred by the company with respect to year issues of third parties  will not exceed  the expenditures will be funded from operating cash flows 
this estimate is subject to change as additional information is obtained in connection with the company s assessment of the year issue 
as of september   the company had incurred costs of approximately  related to its year assessment  remediation  and testing efforts 
in addition  the company has incurred  which was capitalized and will be amortized over the expected useful life associated with the implementation of the new erp system in its finland facility  which was funded from operating cash flows and existing cash balances 
the company presently believes that year issues will not pose significant problems for the company 
however  if all year issues have not been properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely with respect to year problems that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors and others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities  such as one or more of the company s critical customers or suppliers  will not have a material adverse impact on the company s systems or its business  financial condition or results of operations 
finally  if there are infrastructure failures  such as disruptions in the supply of power  water  transportation  communications services  or if major institutions  such as the government  foreign or domestic banking systems  are unable to continue to provide their services or support resulting in a disruption in services or support to the company  the company may be unable to operate for the duration of the disruption 
the foregoing statements as to the company s expectations regarding the impact on the company of the year problem are forward looking statements that are based upon management s assumptions and expectations regarding future events  third party remediation plans and certifications  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these expectations will prove to be accurate and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the ability to identify  assess  remediate and test all relevant computer codes and embedded technology  the reliability of third party assessments and certifications  and similar uncertainties 
introduction of the euro the company has established a team to address the issues raised by the introduction of the single european currency euro for initial implementation as of october  and during the transition period through to january  the company expects that its internal systems that will be affected by the initial introduction of the euro will be euro capable by january   and does not expect the costs of system modifications to be material 
the company does not presently expect that introduction and use of the euro will result in any material increase in costs to the company 
while the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro introduction over time  based on currently available information  management does not believe that the introduction of the euro currency will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operation 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities litigation reform act of that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company s business  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements due to numerous factors  including  but not limited to those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed from time to time in the company s other securities and exchange commission filings and reports 
in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  and general domestic and international economic conditions 
the forward looking statements contained in this report speak only as of the date on which they are made  and the company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report 
if the company does update one or more forward looking statements  investors and others should not conclude that the company will make additional updates with respect thereto or with respect to other forward looking statements 
outlook issues and uncertainties the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating the company s future financial performance and prospects for growth 
competition the market for information displays is highly competitive  and the company expects this to continue 
the company believes that over time this competition will have the effect of reducing average selling prices of flat panel displays 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater name recognition and financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company  and competitors of the company have made and continue to make significant investments in the construction of manufacturing facilities for amlcds and other advanced displays 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing products that would render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
to the extent the company is unable to compete effectively against its competitors  whether due to such practices or otherwise  its financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
development of new products and risks of technological change the company s future results of operations will depend upon its ability to improve and market its existing products and to successfully develop  manufacture and market new products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to improve and market its existing products or develop and market new products  or that technological developments will not cause the company s products or technology to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
even successful new product introductions typically result in pressure on gross margins during the initial phases as costs of manufacturing start up activities are spread over lower initial sales volumes 
the company has experienced lower than expected yields with respect to new products and processes in the past 
these low yields have and will continue to have a negative impact on gross margins 
in addition  customer relationships are negatively impacted due to production problems and late delivery of shipments 
a portion of the company s flat panel products rely on el technology  which currently constitutes only a small portion of the information display market 
through the acquisition of standish industries  inc  the company has diversified its display products and expanded its addressable market significantly to include flat panel passive liquid crystal display applications 
the company s future success will depend in part upon increased market acceptance of existing el  passive lcd and active matrix lcd technologies  and other future technological developments 
in that regard  the company s competitors are investing substantial resources in the development and manufacture of displays using a number of alternative technologies 
in the event these efforts result in the development of products that offer significant advantages over the company s products  and the company is unable to improve its technology or develop or acquire an alternative technology that is more competitive  the company s business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the company s military product sales are significantly based on crt technology 
military avionics contractors are increasingly focused on incorporating displays  primarily amlcds  into cockpit applications that have traditionally used crts 
the company s ability to transition the military product line to flat panel displays over the next few years will be important to the long term success of planar s military avionics business 
level of advanced research and development funding the company s advanced research and development activities have significantly been funded by outside sources  including agencies of the united states and finnish governments and private sector companies 
the company s recently funded research and development activities have principally focused on multi color and full color displays  miniature displays  low power displays  advanced packaging and other applications 
the actual funding that will be recognized in future periods is subject to wide fluctuation due to a variety of factors including government appropriation of the necessary funds and the level of effort spent on contracts by the company 
within congress  there has been significant debate on the level of the funding to be made available to programs that have historically supported the company s research activities 
additionally  government research and development funding has been gradually shifting to a more commercial approach  and contractors are increasingly required to share in the development costs 
this trend is likely to continue  which could increase the company s net research and development expenses 
while the company has historically not experienced any loss or decline of external research funding  the loss or substantial reduction of such funding could adversely affect the company s results of operations and its ability to continue research and development activities at current levels 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
international operations and currency exchange rate fluctuations shipments to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately  and  of the company s sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company anticipates that international shipments will continue to account for a significant portion of its sales 
as a result  the company is subject to risks associated with international operations  including trade restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  changes in tariffs  export license requirements and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations including  in finland  relations with national labor unions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
declining military expenditures the company s sales associated with military applications have been increasing 
however  military capital expenditure levels have been declining for several years and depend largely on factors outside of the company s control 
although the company believes that its dependence on military sales will decrease as the company continues to expand its customer base  no assurance can be given that military sales will continue at current levels 
in addition  as a result of the reduction in military sales  several key suppliers have threatened to halt production of critical components 
although the company believes it has reached agreement with each of its critical vendors  no assurance can be given that critical material supply will be available when needed 
the company continues to develop strategic relationships with suppliers 
however  there can be no assurance given that these strategic relationships will continue in the future and the company will receive the critical components required to meet production and shipment schedules 
effects of quarterly fluctuations in operating results results of operations have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
various factors  including timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  disruption in the supply of components for the company s products  changes in product mix  capacity utilization  the timing of orders from major customers  production delays or inefficiencies  inventory obsolescence charges  the timing of expenses and other factors affect results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
the company s backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not normally include all orders needed to achieve expected sales for the quarter 
consequently  the company is dependent upon obtaining orders for shipment in a particular quarter to achieve its sales objectives for that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on expected future sales 
if sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results may be adversely affected
