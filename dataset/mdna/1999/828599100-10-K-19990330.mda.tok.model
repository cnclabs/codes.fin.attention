item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company has continued to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of its net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of the company s large customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design modifications  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers  and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
any terminations of manufacturing relationships or changes  reductions or delays in orders could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s results also depend to a substantial extent on the success of its oem customers in marketing their products 
the company is always seeking to diversify its customer base to reduce its reliance on its few major customers 
see business strategy and customers under item  business 
the industry segments served by the company and the electronics industry as a whole  are subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
discontinuance or modification of products containing components manufactured by the company could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the electronics industry is also subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced  and is likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
a general recession in the electronics industry could have a material adverse effect on techdyne s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company typically does not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from its customers but rather attempts to work with its customers to anticipate future volumes of orders 
based upon such anticipated future orders  the company will make commitments regarding the level of business it wants and can accomplish  the timing of production schedules and the levels of and utilization of facilities and personnel 
occasionally  the company will purchase raw materials without a customer order or commitment 
customers may cancel  delay or reduce orders  usually without penalty  for a variety of reasons  whether relating to the customer or the industry in general  which orders were already made or anticipated by the company 
any significant cancellations  reductions or order delays could adversely affect the results of operations 
the company uses erp techniques through its visual manufacturing system see item  business business strategy and year readiness below in its efforts to continuously develop accurate forecasts of customer volume requirements 
the company is dependent on the timely availability of many components 
component shortages could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or increased component prices which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations

techdyne must continuously develop improved manufacturing procedures to accommodate its customers needs for increasingly complex products 
to continue to grow and be a successful competitor  the company must be able to maintain and enhance its technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although management believes that the company s operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies and equipment currently required by the company s customers  there can be no assurance that the company s process development efforts will be successful or that the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements will not render the company s technology  equipment or processes obsolete or uncompetitive 
in addition  to the extent that the company determines that new assembly and testing technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to require significant capital investment 
during periods of recession in the electronics industry  the company s competitive advantages in the areas of quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to electronic oems  who may become more price sensitive 
the company s results of operations are also affected by other factors  including price competition  the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs  the overhead efficiencies achieved by the company in managing the costs of its operations  the company s experience in manufacturing a particular product  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased orders  and selling  general and administrative expenses

year readiness the year computer information processing challenge associated with the upcoming millennium change concerns the ability of computerized information systems to properly recognize date sensitive information  with which many companies  public and private  are faced to ensure continued proper operations and reporting of financial condition 
failure to correct and comply with the year change may cause systems that cannot recognize the new date and millenium information to generate erroneous data or to fail to operate 
management is fully aware of the year issues  has made its assessments and has evaluated its computerized systems and equipment  and communicated with its major vendors  and has substantially made the operations of the company year compliant 
in the company commenced upgrading its operations software program by acquiring a new visual manufacturing software package

management believes this new system is providing it with leverage in material pricing  production  timely delivery and thereby enabling the company to be more competitive in bidding for manufacturing business 
this visual manufacturing system also enables the company to better track actual costs against its quotes  thereby allowing the company to more effectively control costs and manage operating margins 
the cost of this new software program for the florida  texas and massachusetts operations was approximately  and for ohio and scotland the cost is estimated to be approximately  its parent s cost for the hardware and software was approximately  the visual manufacturing system has been pre tested and guaranteed by the manu facturer to be year compliant 
the company and its parent have an ongoing consulting  training and servicing arrangement with the system s manufacturer for  per annum

with respect to non information technology systems which typically include embedded technology such as microcontrollers  the major equipment used in the company s manufacturing operations is not date sensitive and should not pose any threat of system breakdown 
the quality control cirrus testers have recently been tested and are year compliant 
the personal computer hardware and software systems have been checked and have been determined to be year compliant 
one computer was replaced with a newer year compliant system at no cost 
any upgrading and replacements would cost approximately  per unit 
the company has communicated with its key vendors  customers and other third parties with whom its operations are essential to inquire of their assessment of their year issues and actions being taken to resolve those issues 
the company has received approximately responses of which half have given written assurance that they are year compliant  with the balance assuring the company they will be year compliant before the millenium change 
to the extent such third parties are potentially adversely affected by the year issues  and such is not timely and properly resolved by such persons  this could disrupt the company s operations to the extent that the company will have to find alternative vendors or customers that have resolved their year issues 
no assurance can be given that the company s new visual manufacturing software program will be successful in its anticipated operational benefits as assessed above or that the company s key vendors and customers will have successful conversion programs  and that any such failures  whether relating to the manufacturing operational efficiencies or the year issue  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition

these agreements  which totaled approximately  as of december   contain provisions which can either result in a gain or a cost to the company for early settlement of the related debt depending on whether rates have increased or decreased since the agreements were negotiated 
at december   early settlement of these debt obligations would have had a negative impact of approximately  on the company s results of operations 
the company s exposure to market risks from foreign currency exchange rates relates to its scottish subsidiary whose results of operations when trans lated into us dollars are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
a strengthening of the us dollar against the local scottish currency  the pound  would have negatively impacted earnings by approximately  the company has not incurred any significant realized losses on exchange transac tions and does not utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency fluctuations
