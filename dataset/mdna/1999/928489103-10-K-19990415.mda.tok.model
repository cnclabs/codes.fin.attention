year compliance computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors that use only two digits to identify a year in a date field may be unable to process accurately certain date based information at or after the year the company recognizes the need to insure that its operations will not be adversely affected by year software failures 
software failures due to processing errors potentially arising from calculations using the year date are a recognized risk  and the company is addressing this issue on several different fronts 
the company believes that all company branded hardware products shipped since january are year compliant 
earlier company branded hardware products can be made year compliant through bios upgrades or software supplements 
in addition to internal year software and equipment implementation activities  the company is in contact with its suppliers to assess their compliance 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect on the company if third parties do not convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s systems 
the company believes that its actions with suppliers will minimize these risks 
finally  the company has established an internal workforce to coordinate solutions for the year issue for its own internal information systems and as of december  has determined that its internal information systems are year compliant 
through december   the company has not incurred material expenses relating to year compliance efforts and believes that the expenses associated with completing its year compliance plans will not have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
internal and external expenses specifically associated with modifying internal use software for the year will be expensed as incurred 
the company s current estimates of the amount of time and expenses necessary to implement and test its computer systems are based on the facts and circumstances existing at this time 
nevertheless  achieving year compliance is dependent on many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
should either the company s internal system or the internal systems of one or more significant vendors or suppliers fail to achieve year compliance  the company s business and its results of operations could be adversely affected

dependence on key personnel  recruitment of additional personnel 
the ability of the company to attract and retain highly skilled personnel is critical to the operations of the company 
to date  the company has been able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for its operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future  particularly in light of the company s expansion plans 
if the company is unable to attract and retain personnel with necessary skills when needed  its business and expansion plans could be materially adversely affected 
the company is dependent upon the efforts and abilities of georges c 
st 
laurent iii  its chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and william c 
st 
laurent  its president and chief operating officer  each of whom is a substantial shareholder in the company 
the loss or unavailability of the services of either of these individuals for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on the company s business prospects 
the company has obtained  and is the sole beneficiary of  key person life insurance in the amount of million on the life of each of messrs 
st 
laurent 
there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
fluctuation of quarterly results 
the computer industry generally has been subject to seasonality and to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in operating results  and the company s operating results have been subject to such fluctuations 
the company s quarterly net sales and operating results may vary significantly as a result of  among other things  historical seasonal purchasing patterns and the general economic climate in brazil  the volume and timing of orders received during a quarter  variations in sales mix  delays in production schedules  new product developments or introductions  availability of components  changes in product mix and pricing  and product reviews and other media coverage 
the company s sales plan provides for approximately of the company s sales to be made to federal  state  and municipal government customers 
such sales at times may involve large contracts that can be a significant part of the company s sales 
the company s sales to the consumer and small business markets fluctuate seasonally and are dependent in part on the spending patterns of its customers  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions 
historically  the company s sales have increased in the third and fourth quarters due  in part  to holiday spending 
accordingly  the company s historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and  in general  management expects that the company s financial results may vary materially from period to period 
see the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
possible need for additional financing 
in order to pursue the company s business strategy  the company may need to seek additional funding through public or private financing and may  when attractive sources of capital become available  elect to obtain capital in anticipation of such needs 
adequate funds for growth through internal expansion and through acquisitions may not be available when needed or may not be available on terms favorable to the company 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities or related instruments with conversion or warrant features  dilution to existing shareholders may result 
if funding is insufficient  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of its expansion programs 
in addition  the company has in the past sought funding through third parties related to the company s management and there can be no assurance that these sources can be relied upon in the future 
more recently  the company has entered into a receivables financing facility with tac  an independently owned special purpose corporation  pursuant to which tac issues and sells senior notes to investors collateralized by certain receivables of the company 
the company is required to repurchase these receivables under certain circumstances  including their non payment 
the company currently believes that the projected cash flows from continuing operations and existing and contemplated sources of credit will be sufficient to satisfy its capital requirements and finance its plans for expansion for the next months 
such belief is based on certain assumptions  and there can be no assurance that such assumptions are correct 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such resources will be sufficient to satisfy the company s capital requirements or expansion plans for such period 
there can be no assurance that such contemplated sources will be available at the time they are needed or that the receivables financing facility with tac will be available to the company for financing accounts receivable at favorable terms

competition 
the manufacturing and sale of computer equipment and related products is highly competitive and requires substantial capital 
the company competes with  and will compete with  numerous international  national  and regional companies  many of which have significantly larger operations and greater financial  marketing  human  and other resources than the company  which may give such competitors competitive advantages  including economies of scale and scope 
competitors in the computer hardware market include internationally recognized companies such as ibm  acer  dell  hewlett packard and compaq 
additionally  the company competes in the systems integration market with internationally recognized systems integrators such as ibm  eds and unisys 
competition is based on price  product quality  customer support and the ability to deliver products in a timely fashion 
no assurance can be given that the company will successfully compete in any market in which it conducts or may conduct operations 
in addition  the company competes with other small manufacturers of computer equipment sold on what is known as the gray market in brazil 
such manufacturers are able to sell products at prices that are often significantly lower than those offered by the company and other legitimate manufacturers 
gray market manufacturers are able to offer lower prices because of the avoidance of import duties and other taxes  and the avoidance of necessary software licensing fees 
there can be no assurance that gray market activity will not continue to flourish  putting downward pressures on the company s profit margins as result of low pricing strategies 
importance of customer credit and risks of customer lending 
in  the company began providing extended credit terms to its customers 
credit sales are an important component of the company s results of operations 
in  approximately of the company s net sales revenue was accounted for by sales on credit with terms from to months 
the company s results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if demand for customer credit falls  or if brazilian government policies curtail the company s ability to extend credit or to fund its extensions of credit 
in addition  the company s customer credit activities expose it to significant risks 
at december   the company s outstanding exposure to customer credit risk was approximately million  including the balance of accounts receivable sold to tac 
while an allowance for doubtful accounts including those sold to tac is made monthly based on management s reviews of prior period losses and anticipated losses  there can be no assurance that such allowances would be sufficient to cover actual losses 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business customer financing 
dependence on suppliers 
the company s manufacturing process requires a high volume of quality components that are procured from third party suppliers 
reliance on suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involves several risks  including the possibility of defective parts which can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of the company s products  a shortage of components and reduced control over delivery schedules which can adversely affect the company s manufacturing efficiencies and increases in component costs which can adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company currently purchases all of its microprocessors from intel 
additionally  the company has several other single sourced supplier relationships  either because alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance  quality  support  delivery  capacity or price considerations 
if these sources are unable to provide timely and reliable supply  the company could experience manufacturing delays or inefficiencies  adversely affecting its results of operations 
during the year ended december   the company had one supplier which accounted for more than of purchases 
substantially all of the company s inventory has  and will be  purchased from manufacturers and distributors with whom the company has entered into non exclusive agreements  which are typically cancelable upon days written notice 
there can be no assurance that such agreements will not be canceled 
the loss of  or significant disruptions in relationships with  suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business since there can be no assurance that the company will be able to replace lost suppliers on a timely basis

acquisitions  integration of microtec into the company s operations 
in july  the company completed the acquisition of microtec and  in november  the company completed the acquisitions of majority interests in rectech and techshop 
the company s business strategy includes other potential acquisitions  although the company is not currently negotiating to acquire any other additional companies and has no commitments  understandings or arrangements with respect to any specific transaction 
acquisitions  including that of microtec  involve a number of risks that could adversely affect the company s operating results  including i the diversion of management s attention  ii the integration of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  iii the amortization of acquired intangible assets  iv the assumption of potential liabilities  disclosed or undisclosed  associated with the business acquired  v the possibility that the financial and accounting systems utilized by the business acquired will not meet the company s standards  vi the possibility that the business acquired will not maintain the quality of services that the company has historically provided  vii the dilutive effect of the use of the company s common stock as consideration for transactions  and viii the possibility that the company will be unable to attract and retain qualified local management for both the acquirees operations and the ensuing consolidated operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will consummate any future acquisitions on satisfactory terms  that adequate financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or that any acquired operations will be successfully integrated or that such operations will ultimately have a positive impact on the company  its financial condition or results of operations 
tax exempt status 
the government of the state of bahia  brazil has issued a decree that exempts companies such as the company s subsidiary  bahiatech  from the payment of state import duties  state sales tax  and state services tax 
bahiatech has received an exemption from such taxes through and including the year additionally  bahiatech is exempted from the payment of brazilian federal income tax through and including the year  provided that the company meets certain budgeted production goals 
the company is not exempted from the payment of a federal social contribution tax of approximately of pre tax income 
the normal rate of federal taxation on a non exempt basis is 
in the event that the company is unable to extend such tax exempt status  the company s after tax earnings as a percentage of net sales would decline by the amount of the tax benefit  which may be substantial 
see business tax exempt status 
consequences of technological changes 
the market for the company s products is characterized by continuous and rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards 
compatibility with industry standards in areas such as operating systems and communications protocols is material to the company s marketing strategy and product development efforts 
in order to remain competitive  the company must respond effectively to technological changes by continuing to enhance and improve its existing products to incorporate emerging or evolving standards  and by successfully developing and introducing new products that meet customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop  market  or support such products or that the company will respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements or introductions by others 
in the event that the company does not enhance and improve its products  the company s sales and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  as a result of technological changes  all or a portion of the company s inventory would not be rendered obsolete

affiliated transactions and conflicts of interest 
the company has  since  received loans and sold securities and certain of its accounts receivable to georges c 
st 
laurent jr 
gsl jr  the father of georges c

laurent iii  the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and william c

the company believes that the terms of these transactions were no less favorable to the company than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
to the extent the company enters into transactions with affiliated persons and entities in the future  it will do so only on terms no less favorable to the company than those available from unaffiliated third parties

assets outside the us  enforceability of civil liabilities against foreign persons 
while the company is a us corporation with executive offices in florida  its principal operations are conducted by its brazilian subsidiaries 
for the foreseeable future  a substantial portion of the company s assets will be held or used outside the us in brazil 
consequently  enforcement by investors of civil liabilities under the federal securities laws may be adversely affected by the fact that  while the company is located in the us  its principal subsidiaries and operations are located in brazil 
although the company s executive officers and directors are residents of the us  except for messrs 
touma makdassi elias and william r 
blackhurst  who are residents of brazil  all or a substantial portion of the assets of the company are located outside the us the effect of volatility on the repatriation of excess retained earnings through the floating rate market 
for the foreseeable future  bahiatech does not intend to distribute any excess retained earnings to vitech  but intends to reinvest such earnings  if any  in the development and expansion of its business 
up to now  substantially all of the retained earnings of the company on a consolidated basis have been attributable to bahiatech 
bahiatech is exempted from the payment of brazilian federal income tax through and including the year  provided that the company meets certain budgeted production goals 
tax exemption benefits cannot be distributed as dividends to the parent company in us dollars and are segregated for capital reserves and offsetting accumulated losses in accordance with brazilian law 
for the years ended december   and the tax exemption benefits amounted to  per share   per share and  per share  respectively 
in the future  should bahiatech wish to remit retained earnings in excess of the tax exemption benefits in us dollars  it may do so only in reais convertible into us dollars in the floating rate exchange market 
there are two legal foreign exchange markets in brazil the commercial market and the floating market 
the commercial market rate is the commercial selling rate for brazilian currency into us dollars  as reported by the central bank 
the floating market rate generally applies to transactions to which the commercial market rate does not apply 
prior to the implementation of the real plan  the commercial market rate and the floating market rate differed significantly at times 
since the introduction of the real  the two rates have not differed significantly 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be significant differences between the two rates in the future 
both the commercial market rate and the floating market rate are reported by the central bank on a daily basis 
in order for a company to remit retained earnings abroad in us dollars at the commercial market rate  brazilian law first requires the registration of the foreign capital upon which those retained earnings were made 
bahiatech has not made such registration and therefore is only able to remit excess retained earnings at the floating market rate 
the company uses the commercial market rate for the translation of bahiatech s results into us dollars 
in the event that bahiatech remits excess retained earnings at the floating market rate  there can be no assurance that such remittance will not vary from the company s reported results because of the differences between the commercial market rate and the floating market rate 
although microtec does not currently intend to distribute any retained earnings to vitech  it is currently eligible to remit retained earnings in us dollars at the commercial market rate

government regulation 
the manufacture of computer equipment and related products is subject to various forms of government regulation in the united states and brazil 
the company and its operations are affected by technology transfer and licensing regulations  tariff regulations  regulations governing currency conversion and transfers of profits between jurisdictions  and labor regulations  among others 
while the company does not believe that such regulations adversely affect the company or its business presently  there can be no assurance that such regulations will not materially adversely affect the company in the future 
in addition  the government of brazil has exercised  and continues to exercise  substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in brazil 
share price volatility 
the market for securities of technology companies and companies that participate in emerging markets historically has been more volatile than the market for stocks in general 
the price of the common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcement of acquisitions  vendor additions or cancellations  creation or elimination of banking or other funding opportunities  favorable or unfavorable coverage of the company or its officers by the press  and the availability of new products  technology  or services 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many technology and emerging market companies  both related and unrelated to the operating results of such companies 
these market fluctuations and other factors may affect the market for the common stock

dependence on manufacturing facilities 
the company operates one manufacturing facilities in ilheus  bahia  brazil 
in the event such facility were to experience substantial damage or disruption of its operations for any reason  the company may be required to suspend manufacturing operations or transfer manufacturing operations to an independent facility for an indefinite period of time 
while the company maintains insurance covering various contingencies  any such suspension or disruption of its manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations 
see item properties 
year compliance 
many existing computer systems and applications  and other control devices  use only two digits to identify a year in the date code field  and were not designed to account for the upcoming change in the century 
as a result  such systems and applications could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected so that they can process data related to the year the company relies on its systems  applications and devices in operating and monitoring all major aspects of its business  including financial systems such as general ledger  accounts payable and accounts receivable modules  inventory and receivables systems  customer services  infrastructure  embedded computer chips  networks and telecommunications equipment and end products 
the company also relies  directly and indirectly  on systems of external business enterprises such as distributors  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  and governmental entities  for accurate exchange of data 
although the company is in contact with its suppliers to assess their compliance  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect on the company if third parties do not convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s systems  as the company could be affected through disruptions in the operation of the enterprises with which the company interacts 
based on the information currently available  the company believes that the costs associated with the year issue  and the consequences of incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue  will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations in any given year  however  there can be no assurance that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations

factors relating to brazil political and economic conditions 
the brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent and occasionally drastic intervention by the brazilian government 
the brazilian government has often changed monetary  credit  tariff and other policies to influence the course of brazil s economy 
the brazilian government s actions to control inflation and effect other policies have often involved wage and price controls as well as other measures  such as freezing bank accounts  imposing capital controls and limiting imports into brazil 
changes in policy involving tariffs  exchange controls  and other matters could have a material adverse effect on the company  as could inflation  devaluation  social instability and other political  economic or diplomatic developments  and the brazilian government s response to such developments 
the brazilian political environment has been marked by high levels of uncertainty since the country returned to civilian rule in after years of military government 
the death of a president elect in and the resignation of another president in during his impeachment trial  as well as frequent turnovers at and immediately below the cabinet level  particularly in the economic area  historically have contributed to the absence of a coherent and sustained policy to confront brazil s economic problems 
mr 
fernando henrique cardoso  the finance minister at the time of the implementation of brazil s latest economic stabilization plan  was elected president in october the real plan  which has significantly reduced inflation since the introduction of the real in july  has been continued by the cardoso government 
see impact of extreme inflation below 
president cardoso has continued to support free market and privatization measures of recent years  and his government has taken steps in this regard  such as proposing measures for the liberalization of the state petroleum and telecommunications monopolies and the privatization of a number of state owned enterprises 
although these liberalization measures have enjoyed broad political and public support  some important political factions remain opposed to significant elements of the reform program 
in addition  president cardoso was elected as the leader of a coalition of political parties and governs brazil by coalition government 
as a result  president cardoso s leadership of brazil is likely to be subject to more compromises and accommodations than if his party alone had received support from the majority of voters 
furthermore  the brazilian government s desire to control inflation and to reduce budget deficits may cause it to take actions that will slow or halt brazilian economic growth 
impact of extreme inflation 
brazil has historically experienced extremely high rates of inflation 
inflation itself  as well as certain governmental measures to combat inflation  have in the past had significant negative effects on the brazilian economy 
inflation  actions taken to combat inflation and public speculation about possible future actions have also contributed significantly to economic uncertainty in brazil and to heightened volatility in the brazilian securities markets 
beginning in december  the brazilian government introduced the real plan  an economic stabilization plan designed to reduce inflation by reducing certain public expenditures  collecting liabilities owed to the brazilian government  increasing tax revenues  continuing the privatization program and introducing a new currency 
on july   as part of the real plan  the brazilian government introduced the real 
since the introduction of the real  brazil s inflation rate has been substantially lower than in previous periods 
inflation  as measured by the igp di  was approximately     and in     and  respectively 
there can be no assurance  however  that the recent lower level of inflation will continue or that future brazilian governmental actions including actions to adjust the value of the brazilian currency such as the devaluation of the real in january will not trigger an increase in inflation or that any such increase will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of exchange rate fluctuations 
the relationship of brazil s currency to the value of the us dollar  and the rates of devaluation of brazil s currency relative to the prevailing rates of inflation have affected  and may affect  the company s financial condition and results of operations 
principally all of the company s sales are denominated in the real  while the company s operating results are recorded in us dollars 
any significant devaluation of the real relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
although the company had used real futures and options contracts during  in an effort to hedge against currency risks  its highest coverage at any one time had only met of its exposure  consisting of accounts receivable denominated in reais  net of accounts payable and other current liabilities denominated in reais 
currently  the company is not engaged in any hedging activities 
currency transaction losses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  and were associated with dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by the company s brazilian subsidiaries 
in the event of a significant devaluation of the brazilian currency in relation to the us dollar or other currencies  the ability of the company to meet its foreign currency denominated obligations could be adversely and materially affected 
increases in the rate of inflation in brazil subsequent to such a devaluation of the brazilian currency could adversely affect the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company 
although the exchange rate between the real and the us dollar had been relatively stable from mid july through late  the spread of the asian and russian economic difficulties to south america culminated in the devaluation of the real in mid january by the end of january  the real dropped against the dollar by approximately compared to the end of december in addition  gustavo franco  the president of brazil s central bank and an architect of the real plan  resigned  amid rumors of policy differences between mr 
franco and mr 
francisco lopes  then the central bank s director of monetary policy and who has since been replaced 
although some recent economic measures have been taken by the brazilian federal government in an effort to stabilize the real  the potential for future devaluation or volatility continues to persist 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  impact of extreme inflation 
exchange controls and restrictions 
brazilian law provides that  whenever there is a serious imbalance in brazil s balance of payments or serious reasons to foresee such imbalance  the brazilian government may  for a limited period of time  impose restrictions on the remittance to foreign investors of the proceeds of their investments in brazil  as it did for approximately six months in and early  and on the conversion of brazilian currency into foreign currencies 
no assurance can be given that the international transfer of reais or the floating market will remain legally or commercially available to brazilian residents 
there can be no assurance that the brazilian government will not in the future impose more restrictive foreign exchange regulations that would have the effect of preventing or restricting the company s access to foreign currency that it may require to meet its foreign currency obligations under foreign currency denominated liabilities 
change of economic environment 
despite the success to date of the real plan in reducing inflation in brazil  the fiscal adjustment program necessary to reduce government expenditures is not complete after the fifth year of the real plan 
there can be no assurance that the real plan will be more successful than previous economic programs in reducing inflation over the long term  especially in light of i the brazilian congress delay in the real plan and in the reform of the social security system  and ii the negative effects of the asian  russian and latin american crises on brazil  which has caused a flight of foreign investment  the devaluation of the real and new inflationary pressures on the brazilian economy 
accordingly  periods of substantial inflation may once again have significant adverse effects on the brazilian economy  on the value of the real and on the company s financial condition  results of operations and future prospects
