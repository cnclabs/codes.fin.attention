results of operations the company primarily designs  manufactures  markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits 
the company s products are used in photolithography for exposure and photoresist processing  and in deposition for oxidation diffusion and low pressure chemical vapor deposition lpcvd  and with the acquisition of the semiconductor equipment group of watkins johnson  thermal processing products which address atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition apcvd 
the company manufactures and markets photolithography exposure svgl products  photoresist processing track products  oxidation diffusion  chemical vapor deposition and lpcvd  apcvd thermal products and certain precision optical components 
on july   the company acquired the business of the semiconductor equipment group of watkins johnson company seg 
the acquisition was accounted under the purchase method of accounting for financial reporting purposes 
the results of the company for fiscal include the operating results of seg from the date of acquisition 
on november   the company acquired tinsley laboratories  inc tli 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests for financial reporting purposes 
all amounts discussed below have been retroactively restated to reflect the inclusion of tli 
the semiconductor industry into which the company sells its products is highly cyclical and has  historically  experienced periodic downturns that have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor processing equipment 
as a result of the asian economic crisis which began in  an oversupply of certain semiconductor products  the impact of low cost personal computers  and various other factors  semiconductor manufacturers reduced planned expenditures and cancelled or delayed the construction of new fabrication facilities 
this slowdown in demand began to impact the company during the first quarter of fiscal and continued to impact the company through out fiscal the slowdown in demand resulted in the company experiencing lower new customer orders  customer deferrals of scheduled equipment delivery dates and  to a lesser extent  customer order cancellations 
customer orders with scheduled delivery dates are referred to by the company as bookings 
last year s lower bookings  order rescheduling and cancellations  have caused sales and net income during fiscal to decline from prior years amounts 
although the company has experienced a modest improvement in new bookings as during the second half of fiscal the company recorded new bookings of  up from new bookings of  and  during the first half of fiscal and the second half of fiscal  respectively  there can be no assurance that the dollar amount of new bookings will continue to increase 
there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future experience further customer delivery deferrals  additional order cancellations or a prolonged period of customer orders at reduced levels  any or a combination of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
during fiscal in an effort to lessen the impact of these lower sales volumes  the company took several steps to reduce operating expenses including a reduction in workforce  temporary shutdowns and the restructuring of certain portions of the company s business 
during the second half of fiscal  the company shut down the majority of its operations for days and recorded restructuring and related charges of  the restructuring and related charges include costs of  resulting from the termination of the company s previously announced aps photoresist processing system and a provision of  for reductions in the company s workforce for approximately  employees 
historically  the company has relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of its net sales 
in fiscal  the company s largest customer accounted for of net sales 
the company believes that  for the foreseeable future  it will continue to rely on a limited number of major customers for a substantial percentage of its net sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were  below fiscal net sales of  the decrease in net sales was due to lower shipments of track  thermal and lithography products during fiscal  offset in part by sales of apcvd products during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from the seg acquisition 
the decrease in net sales occurred across all geographies except israel where sales increased by  reflecting continued expansion of customer manufacturing operations in israel 
the company s fiscal net bookings were  representing a book to bill ratio of to  significantly above fiscal net bookings of  representing a book to bill ratio of 
to at september   the company had a backlog of  a increase over september  backlog of  the company includes in backlog only those orders to which a purchase order number has been assigned by the customer  with substantially all of the terms and conditions agreed upon  and for which delivery has been specified within twelve months 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company reduced its nanometer orders by approximately  of this amount  customer orders for three machines totaling  were cancelled and removed from the company s backlog due to customer requirements having changed 
see svgl research and development funding 
backlog at september   included orders for micrascan photolithography products 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recognized net sales of approximately  from one customer who accepted and took title to the related equipment and agreed to normal payment terms  but requested that the company store the equipment until predetermined shipment dates 
during fiscal approximately  in net sales to two such customers was recognized 
at september   the company was storing approximately  of such equipment with a scheduled shipment date of march fiscal gross margin was  slightly above fiscal gross margin of 
fiscal cost of sales includes  in restructuring charges for the write off of aps inventory 
excluding the impact of the aps inventory charge  the fiscal adjusted gross margin was 
the decrease in fiscal gross margin when compared to fiscal adjusted gross margin was primarily the result of the impact associated with the fourth quarter fiscal inventory provision due to the cancellation of orders discussed above under the low na nm lithography program  higher per unit costs resulting from lower shipment volumes of thermal products  partially offset by higher margin shipments of the company s newly acquired apcvd products 
research  development and related engineering r d expenses are net of funding received from outside parties under various development agreements 
such funding is typically payable upon the attainment of one or more development milestones that are specified in the agreements 
during fiscal years  and funding was primarily related to agreements between the company and certain customers for the development of a nanometer micrascan system development program 
during june certain participants in the development program decided that their product needs have changed for initial nanometer machines and have withdrawn from the development program and chosen to use or are evaluating other solutions 
see svgl research and development funding 
during fiscal  r d expenses were  of net sales  compared to  of net sales during fiscal such r d amounts are net of funding recognized under joint development agreements of  and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
r d expense increased over fiscal primarily due to increased spending on the nanometer development program  reduced development funding  offset in part by reduced spending on the aps track product resulting from its fiscal cancellation 
the increase in r d as a percentage of net sales reflects the significant year to year decrease in net sales 
fiscal  marketing  general and administrative mg a expenses were  of net sales  lower than fiscal mg a of  of net sales 
the decrease in mg a from the preceding year was primarily due to reduced product support costs 
the increase in mg a as a percentage of net sales reflects the significant year to year decrease in net sales 
as discussed above  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded restructuring and related charges of  of which  was classified as operating expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company revised its estimate primarily relating to severance and benefits and reversed approximately  of the fiscal restructuring and related charges accrued against operating expenses 
for fiscal  the company had an operating loss of  compared to an operating loss of  during fiscal in comparison to the preceding year  the increase in the operating loss is primarily from reduced gross margin resulting from reduced net sales  increased r d expenses offset in part by the absence of restructuring charges in fiscal and lower mg a expenses 
interest and other income was  during fiscal compared to  for fiscal the year to year increase in interest and other income was primarily the result of foreign currency translation and exchange gains offset in part by lower interest income due to lower average cash balances available for investment 
interest expense in fiscal was  compared to fiscal interest expense of  the increase in interest expense between periods is primarily due to the three japanese bank loans assumed in connection with the acquisition of seg 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a benefit for income taxes for fiscal  compared to a benefit for fiscal variations in the company s effective tax rate relate primarily to changes in the geographic distribution of its pretax income and certain tax free interest income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal the company had a net loss of  loss per share diluted  compared to a net loss of  loss per share diluted for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  net sales were  slightly below fiscal net sales of  the decrease in net sales was due to lower shipments of thermal and track products during fiscal  offset in part by increased shipments of the svgl micrascan photolithography product 
the decrease in net sales occurred across all geographies except ireland and israel where sales increased by  and  respectively 
these increases reflected expansions of customer manufacturing operations in these countries 
the company s fiscal net bookings were  which represented a book to bill ratio of to  significantly below fiscal net bookings of  which represented a book to bill ratio of to at september   the company had a backlog of  a decrease from the september  backlog of  for fiscal  the company s gross margin was  significantly below the fiscal gross margin of 
fiscal included a restructuring charge of  for the write off of aps inventory  which has been included in cost of sales 
this restructuring charge accounted for of the year to year decrease in gross margin 
without taking into account the aps inventory charge  the fiscal gross margin was  a decrease of from the fiscal gross margin 
this decrease was primarily the result of lower volumes and higher fixed costs for svgl products during the second half of fiscal and the overall effect of lower volumes of thermal and to a lesser degree  track products 
r d expenses were  of net sales during fiscal  compared to  of net sales during fiscal such r d amounts are net of funding recognized under joint development agreements of  and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the year to year increase in r d was primarily due to new product and process development  particularly for svgl products  the design and development of equipment capable of processing the next generation mm wafer and costs associated with track s subsequently terminated aps program 
during late fiscal and early fiscal  the company sold approximately  in product to submicron technology pcl smt  a newly established semiconductor foundry in thailand 
smt paid the company approximately  before encountering severe financial difficulties 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the remaining receivable from smt was uncollectible 
after reversing costs accrued for the installation and warranty of the products sold to smt  the company recorded a net charge against its fiscal operating results of approximately  the smt charge 
during fiscal  marketing  general and administrative mg a expenses were  of net sales  lower than fiscal mg a of  of net sales 
the decrease in mg a from the preceding year was primarily due to the effect of the smt charge on fiscal mg a 
as discussed above  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded restructuring and related charges of  of which  was classified as operating expenses 
under the terms of a research and development agreement  svgl owed ibm certain royalties based on future operating results 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company satisfied its obligation to ibm  recognized an expense of  which represented royalties related to products currently under development  and recorded a prepayment of  which represented royalties related to existing products which are being amortized through fiscal for fiscal  the company had an operating loss of  compared to an operating loss of  during fiscal in comparison to the preceding year  the fiscal operating loss was the result of the restructuring charges  lower gross margins on lower net sales and increased r d expenses  offset in part by the non recurring royalty settlement during fiscal interest and other income was  during fiscal compared to  for fiscal the year to year decrease in interest and other income was primarily the result of lower interest income due to lower average cash balances available for investment  foreign currency translation and exchange losses  in large part due to the strength of the us dollar during fiscal  and the absence of certain royalty income under an agreement which expired during the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense of  in fiscal was equivalent to fiscal interest expense of  interest expense in fiscal and was primarily associated with a  loan received from the connecticut development authority 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a benefit for income taxes for fiscal  compared to a provision for fiscal variations in the company s effective tax rate relate primarily to changes in the geographic distribution of its pretax income  settlement of royalty obligations and certain tax free interest income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the minority interest reflected in the company s financial statements represents that share of svgl s operating results attributable at the time to its minority stockholder  ibm 
in march  the company purchased ibm s interest in svgl for  the company now accounts for svgl as a wholly owned subsidiary and there is no longer a minority interest 
in fiscal  minority interest was recorded from the beginning of the fiscal year through the date the company purchased ibm s interest and represented a reduction from income of  for fiscal the company had a net loss of  loss per share diluted  compared to net income of  per share diluted for fiscal liquidity and capital resources at september   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  a decrease of  from the september  balance of  and a decrease of  from the september  balance of  during fiscal years and the company generated  and  respectively  in cash from operating activities 
contributors to positive cash from operations during fiscal include non cash depreciation and amortization  reduced inventories and refundable income taxes offset in part by increased accounts receivable resulting from increased fourth quarter sales  a net loss of  for the fiscal year and reduced accrued liabilities 
net cash used for investing activities for fiscal years and was  and  respectively 
during fiscal purchases of capital equipment were  and net purchases of temporary investments were  net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  during fiscal during fiscal the company received  from the sale of preferred stock and  from the exercise of stock options and issuance of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in connection with the acquisition of seg see note to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed three yen denominated bank loans totaling approximately  bearing interest at rates of between and on june   the company entered into an unsecured  bank revolving line of credit agreement that expires june  advances under the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate or to over libor 
the agreement includes covenants regarding liquidity  profitability  leverage  and coverage of certain charges and minimum net worth and prohibits the payment of cash dividends 
on october  and may   certain of the covenants were amended  in part to reflect the acquisition of seg and change quarterly profitability covenants 
the company is in compliance with the covenants as amended 
at september   there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility 
the company believes that it has sufficient working capital and available bank credit to sustain operations and research and development activities  to the extent such activities are not funded by third parties  and provide for the expansion of its business for the next twelve months 
year as the year approaches  a universal issue has emerged regarding how existing application software programs and operating systems can accommodate date values 
the company has evaluated and continues to evaluate its year risk as it exists in three areas information technology infrastructure  including reviewing what actions are necessary to bring all software tools used internally to year compliance  year readiness of critical suppliers  and year compliance of the products the company supplies to its customers 
the company evaluated its information technology infrastructure for year compliance  which included reviewing what actions were required to make all internal use software systems year compliant 
the company has completed the modification of its internal use computer software for the year the third party costs associated with such modifications were  and were expensed in fiscal although the company believes that the solutions  which were extensively tested  have resulted in its internal use systems being year compliant  there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems that could disrupt operations will not arise  or that the company will not be required to expend further cost and effort to solve such problems 
the company has contacted its critical suppliers and service providers to ascertain their state of readiness and compliance for year issues 
responses have generally indicated substantial remediation  or documented plans to remediate the year issue 
some suppliers have given written certification of internal and product compliance 
substantially all critical suppliers have indicated compliance of their products or service 
the company will continue to monitor their progress and compliance for these issues 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s suppliers and service providers will timely provide the company with products or services which are year compliant 
any failure to do so by such third parties could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company has evaluated its products and identified those areas containing date sensitive year issues 
the company adheres to year test case scenarios established by sematech  an industry group comprised of us semiconductor manufacturers 
the company s compliance efforts and review and identification of corrective measures are substantially complete 
based on this review  the company believes that all products currently being shipped are year compliant 
the company has made available for potential sale the necessary modifications to bring previously shipped products into compliance 
as all customer events cannot be anticipated  the company may see an increase in product warranty and other claims 
in the event that any of the company s products ultimately are not year compliant  or there are customer claims made against the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the total cost to address the year issue has not been and is not expected to be material to the company s financial condition 
the company is using both internal and external resources in its year project 
the company does not segregate internal costs incurred to assess and remedy deficiencies related to the year problem or modifications to its products 
at this time  the company does not feel it is necessary to develop a contingency plan 
as risks are identified  plans will be developed and implemented as required 
although the company believes its year plans will be successful  there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not happen which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risks inherent in the company s business fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company has  at times during its existence  experienced quarterly fluctuations in its operating results 
due to the relatively small number of systems sold during each fiscal quarter and the relatively high revenue per system  customer order rescheduling or cancellations  or production or shipping delays can significantly affect quarterly revenues and profitability 
the company has experienced  and may again experience  quarters during which a substantial portion of the company s net sales are realized near the end of the quarter 
accordingly  shipments scheduled near the end of a quarter  which are delayed for any reason  can cause quarterly net sales to fall short of anticipated levels 
since most of the company s expenses are fixed in the short term  such shortfalls in net sales could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s operating results may also vary from quarter to quarter based upon numerous factors including the timing of new product introductions  product mix  level of sales  the relative proportion of domestic and international sales  activities of competitors  acquisitions  international events  currency exchange fluctuations  and difficulties obtaining materials or components on a timely basis 
in light of these factors  the company may again experience variability in its quarterly operating results 
rapid technological change  dependence on new product development 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change 
the company believes that its future success will depend upon its ability to continue to enhance its existing products and their process capabilities and to develop and manufacture new products with improved process capabilities that enable semiconductor manufacturers to fabricate more advanced semiconductors with increased efficiency 
the company is developing track and lithography products  and has shipped limited quantities of thermal products  capable of processing mm wafers in anticipation of the industry s transition to this larger wafer standard 
failure to successfully introduce these or any other new products in a timely manner would result in the loss of competitive position and could reduce sales of existing products 
in addition  new product introductions could contribute to quarterly fluctuations in operating results as orders for new products commence and increase the potential for a decline in orders of existing products  particularly if new products are delayed 
from time to time  the company has experienced delays in the introduction of its products and product enhancements due to technical  manufacturing and other difficulties and may experience similar delays in the future 
for example  during fiscal  the company announced the subsequently terminated aps track product 
initial shipments of the aps were scheduled to commence during the second quarter of fiscal  and were delayed until the second quarter of fiscal this delay  as well as industry developments  caused the company to implement a plan  which was announced on september   to terminate future development and shipments of its aps products  and to concentrate its efforts on completing the procell product which had been in development for approximately one year 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience delays in completing the development or manufacturing problems related to the procell product as a result of instability of the design of either the hardware or software elements of the new technology  or be able to efficiently manufacture the new product or other products 
during june of the company introduced the procell product for shipment in fiscal the company believes that protracted delays in delivering initial quantities of this newly introduced product or any new product to multiple customers could result in semiconductor manufacturers electing to install competitive equipment and could preclude industry acceptance of the procell product or any of the company s products 
the inability to produce such products or any failure to achieve market acceptance could have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations and could result in a subsequent loss of future sales 
in june of  five participants in the nanometer development program decided that their product needs have changed for initial nanometer machines and have withdrawn from the development program and declined delivery of initial tools 
these participants withdrew in part due to delays in product introduction and changes in participant s technical requirements 
as the lithography demands continue  the company is responding by accelerating the development of a very high numerical aperture vhna version of its nanometer product 
in order to address a broader market with this tool  the company is also redesigning its stage technology to optimize cost of ownership 
although the company believes that the timing of the introduction of the product will be sufficient to meet volume production requirements of 
micron  there can be no assurance that the product will be introduced on time or that customers will wait for the product to commit for their production needs 
the absence of a successful implementation of the product or obtaining sufficient orders for this product could have a material adverse impact on the future profitability of the company 
semiconductor manufacturers tend to select either a single supplier or a primary supplier for a certain type of equipment 
the company believes that prolonged delays in delivering initial quantities of newly developed products to multiple customers  whether due to the protracted release of product from engineering into manufacturing or due to manufacturing difficulties  could result in semiconductor manufacturers electing to install competitive equipment in their fabrication facilities and could preclude industry acceptance of the company s products 
for example  the company s largest track customer has decided to secure deliveries from another source  a decision the company believes is primarily due to the delay and subsequent termination of the aps 
initial shipments into the market of a new technology track product  the procell  is not expected until fiscal as a result  competitors will increase their market share  and it will be increasingly more difficult for the company to regain market position 
the company s inability to effect the timely production of new products or any failure of these products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
historically  the unit cost of the company s products has been the highest when they are newly introduced into production and cost reductions have come over time through engineering improvements  economies of scale and improvements in the manufacturing process 
as a result  new products have  at times  had an unfavorable impact on the company s gross margins and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the initial shipments of new products will not have an adverse effect on the company s profitability or that the company will be able to attain design improvements  manufacturing efficiencies or manufacturing process improvements over time 
further  the potential unfavorable effect of newly introduced products on profitability can be exacerbated when there is intense price competition in the marketplace 
competition 
the semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive 
the company faces substantial competition both in the united states and other countries in all of its products 
the company s competitors include tokyo electron  ltd 
tel and dainippon screen mfg 
co  ltd 
in photoresist processing equipment  tel and kokusai electric co  ltd 
in oxidation diffusion  lpcvd equipment  in its newly acquired apcvd products from watkins johnson the company s competitors include applied materials and quester  and nikon  canon  asm lithography and other suppliers of photolithography exposure equipment  and projection aligners 
the trend toward consolidation in the semiconductor processing equipment industry has made it increasingly important to have the financial resources necessary to compete effectively across a broad range of product offerings  to fund customer service and support on a worldwide basis and to invest in both product and process research and development 
significant competitive factors include technology and cost of ownership  a formula which includes such data as initial price  system throughput and reliability and time to maintain or repair 
other competitive factors include familiarity with particular manufacturers products  established relationships between suppliers and customers  product availability and technological differentiation 
occasionally  the company has encountered intense price competition with respect to particular orders and has had difficulty establishing new relationships with certain customers who have long standing relationships with other suppliers 
the company believes that outside japan and the pacific rim it competes favorably with respect to most of these factors 
see importance of japanese and pacific rim markets 
many of the company s competitors are japanese corporations 
although the economic conditions in asia are improving  the company believes that an oversupply of equipment from certain japanese competitors may continue to cause more severe price competition in its non asian markets 
to compete effectively in these markets  the company may be forced to reduce prices  which could cause further reduction in net sales and gross margins and  consequently  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
customer concentration 
historically  the company has relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of its net sales 
in fiscal  the company s largest customer accounted for of net sales and no other single customer accounted for or more of net sales 
in fiscal  the company s three largest customers accounted for  and of net sales 
the company believes that  for the foreseeable future  it will continue to rely on a limited number of major customers for a substantial percentage of its net sales 
as a result of delays in delivering initial quantities of the subsequently terminated aps track product  one of the company s largest track customers has decided to purchase systems with similar capabilities from another supplier 
we expect that the decision by such customer to purchase systems from other suppliers and the cancellation of the aps track product will continue to have an adverse effect on track product sales in future periods 
see risks inherent in the company s business rapid technological change  dependence on new product development 
the loss of any other significant customer or additional reductions in orders by a significant customer  including reductions in orders due to market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry  or delays in the introduction of newly developed products and product enhancements will further exacerbate the adverse effect the customer order rescheduling and cancellations discussed above will have on the company s business and results of operations 
importance of the japanese and pacific rim markets 
the company s customers are heavily concentrated in the united states and europe 
the japanese and pacific rim markets including fabrication plants located in other parts of the world which are operated by japanese and pacific rim semiconductor manufacturers represent a substantial portion of the overall market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
to date  neither the company s shipments into japan nor the pacific rim have been significant 
the company believes that the japanese companies with which it competes have a competitive advantage because their dominance of the japanese and pacific rim semiconductor equipment market provides them with the sales and technology base to compete more effectively throughout the rest of the world 
the company is not engaged in any significant collaborative effort with any japanese or pacific rim semiconductor manufacturers 
as a result  the company may be at a competitive disadvantage to the japanese equipment suppliers that are engaged in such collaborative efforts with japanese and pacific rim semiconductor manufacturers 
the company believes that it must substantially increase its share of these markets if it is to compete as a global supplier 
further  in many instances  japanese and pacific rim semiconductor manufacturers fabricate devices such as dynamic random access memory devices drams  with potentially different economic cycles than those affecting the sales of devices manufactured by the majority of the company s us and european customers 
failure to secure customers in these markets may limit the global market share available to the company and may increase the company s vulnerability to industry or geographic downturns 
in the past  several of the company s larger customers have entered into joint ventures jv with european  japanese or pacific rim semiconductor manufacturers 
in such cases  the company has encountered intense price competition from foreign competitors who are suppliers to the non us member of the jv 
further  in certain instances the company has not secured the equipment order when the non us member has had the responsibility for selecting the equipment to be used by the jv in its us operations 
there can be no assurance that as the company s customers form additional alliances  whether in the us or in other parts of the world  that the company will be successful in obtaining equipment orders or that it will be able to obtain orders with sufficient gross margin to generate profitable transactions  either of which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
throughout the pacific rim  the company is attempting to compete with major equipment suppliers having significant market share and established service and support infrastructures in place 
the company has invested in the staffing and facilities that it believes are necessary to sell  service and support customers in the pacific rim and with the acquisition of seg  the company acquired from watkins johnson company a  square foot customer demonstration facility in kawasaki city  japan 
however  the company anticipates that it will continue to encounter significant price competition as well as competition based on technological ability 
there can be no assurance that the company s pacific rim operations will be profitable  even if it is successful in obtaining significant sales into this region 
further  due to recent economic issues in certain asian countries  particularly korea  the company s ability to penetrate such markets has been more difficult 
failure to secure customers in these markets would have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
due to the high cost of building  equipping and maintaining fabrication facilities  many customers are outsourcing their manufacturing to foundries  many of which are located in taiwan 
although the company is focused on increasing its penetration into taiwan  it has had limited success in securing volume orders from companies in this area  which have long standing relationships with the company s competitors 
if the company is not successful in penetrating this market  it could have an adverse effect on the company s net sales and results of operations 
risks associated with acquisition of watkins johnson company s semiconductor equipment group 
on july   the company completed the acquisition of the semiconductor equipment group seg of watkins johnson 
the acquisition of the assets of seg is accompanied by a variety of risks  which could prevent the company from realizing any significant benefits from the transaction 
the company may experience difficulty with integrating the operations and personnel of the business acquired from watkins johnson  need additional financial resources to fund the operations of the acquired business  be unable to maximize the company s financial and strategic position by the incorporation or development of the acquired technology and products or lose key employees of the acquired business 
in particular  the company believes it must successfully transition the acquired technology of seg to incorporate process improvements such as single wafer processing and scalability from mm to mm wafer processing capability 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties or delays in transitioning this technology which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the acquisition of seg also included the assumption of certain liabilities of seg  which may prove more costly than the company anticipates 
for example  certain environmental remediation steps have been put in place at the site  there can be no assurance that additional environmental hazards or liabilities will not surface which may have an adverse impact on the company s business 
in order to successfully integrate seg  the company must  among other things  continue to attract and retain key personnel  integrate the acquired products  technology and information systems from engineering  sales  product development and marketing perspectives  and consolidate functions and facilities  which may result in future charges to streamline the combined operations 
difficulties encountered in the integration of seg may have a material adverse effect on the company 
business interruption 
the company manufactures its track products in san jose  california and substantially all of its thermal products in orange and scotts valley  california 
tinsley s optical components are manufactured in richmond and north hollywood  california 
these california facilities are located in seismically active regions 
svgl s photolithography exposure products are manufactured in wilton and ridgefield  connecticut 
if the company were to lose the use of one of its facilities as a result of an earthquake  flood or other natural disaster  the resultant interruptions in operations would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
euro conversion 
on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between each of their existing sovereign currencies and the single european currency 
the participating countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date  with a transition period through january regarding certain elements of the euro change 
in january  the company implemented changes to its internal systems to make them euro capable 
the cost of system modifications to date has not been material  nor are future system modifications expected to be material 
the company does not expect the transition to  or use of  the euro to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
environmental matters 
the company is subject to a number of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic and hazardous chemicals used in the manufacture of certain of the company s products 
the company believes that it is in general compliance with these regulations and that it has obtained or expects to obtain shortly all necessary environmental permits to conduct its business 
the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines or penalties being assessed against the company  interruption of production or reduction in the company s customers accepting its products 
the scotts valley  california facility is subject to an environmental remediation plan being monitored by various governmental agencies 
watkins johnson company purchased a guaranteed fixed price remediation contract from a third party environmental consultant to remediate the groundwater contamination at the facility 
the remediation agreement which includes insurance policies covering performance of the environmental consultant and coverage for undiscovered contamination obligates the third party to perform all of the obligations and responsibilities of watkins johnson company 
there can be no assurance that the third party consultant will have the financial resources or technical expertise to execute under the remediation agreement 
it is not inconceivable that environmental regulatory agencies could ultimately look to the company to remediate the groundwater contamination at the site 
in august  the company purchased from perkin elmer  approximately acres of land and a  square foot building thereon the property located in ridgefield  connecticut 
at the time the company purchased the property  it was aware that certain groundwater and soil contamination was present and that the property was subject to a clean up order being performed by perkin elmer under the jurisdiction of the connecticut department of environmental protection 
agreements between the company and perkin elmer provide that perkin elmer has sole responsibility for all obligations or liabilities related to the clean up order 
while the company believes that it has been adequately indemnified  if for some reason perkin elmer was unable to comply or did not comply with the clean up order  the company could be required to do so 
the company does not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in svgl uncertain market for micrascan products 
the company believes that the photolithography exposure equipment market is one of the largest segments of the semiconductor processing equipment industry 
to address the market for advanced photolithography exposure systems  the company has invested and expects to continue to invest substantial resources in svgl s micrascan technology and its family of micrascan duv step and scan photolithography systems  eventually capable of producing line widths of 
micron and below 
the development of a market for the company s micrascan step and scan photolithography products will be highly dependent on the continued trend towards finer line widths in integrated circuits and the ability of other lithography manufacturers to keep pace with this trend through either enhanced technologies or improved processes 
the company believes duv lithography is required to fabricate devices with line widths below micron 
semiconductor manufacturers can purchase duv steppers to produce product at 
micron line widths 
however  the company believes that as devices increase in complexity and size and require finer line widths  the technical advantages of duv step and scan systems  as compared to duv steppers  will enable semiconductor manufacturers to achieve finer line widths with improved critical dimension control which will result in higher yields of faster devices 
the company also believes that the industry transition to duv step and scan systems has accelerated in calendar and that advanced semiconductor manufacturers are beginning to require volume quantities of production equipment as advanced as the current and pending versions of micrascan to produce both critical and to some degree sub critical layers of semiconductor devices 
currently  competitive duv step and scan equipment capable of producing 
micron line widths and below is available in limited quantities from three competitors 
further  if manufacturers of duv steppers are able to further enhance existing technology to achieve finer line widths sufficiently to erode the competitive and technological advantages of duv step and scan systems  or other manufacturers of step and scan systems are successful in supplying sufficient quantities of product in a timely manner that are technically equal to or better than the micrascan  demand for the micrascan technology may not develop as the company expects 
the company believes that advanced logic devices  drams and asics will require increasingly finer line widths 
consequently  svgl must continue to develop advanced technology equipment capable of meeting its customers current and future requirements while offering those customers a progressively lower cost of ownership 
in particular  the company believes that it must continue its development of future systems capable of printing line widths finer than 
micron and processing mm wafers 
any failure by the company to develop the advanced technology required by its customers at progressively lower costs of ownership and supply sufficient quantities to a worldwide customer base could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that for svgl to succeed in the long term  it must sell its micrascan products on a global basis 
the japanese and pacific rim markets including fabrication plants located in other parts of the world which are operated by japanese and pacific rim semiconductor manufacturers as well as foundries located primarily in taiwan represent a substantial portion of the overall market for photolithography exposure equipment 
to date  the company has not been successful in penetrating either of these markets 
see importance of the japanese and pacific rim markets 
svgl need to increase manufacturing capacity and system output 
the company believes that its ability to supply systems in volume to multiple customers will be a major factor in customer decisions to commit to the micrascan technology 
based upon the expected transition from steppers to step and scan equipment for photolithography equipment  and potential future demand for advanced lithography products  the company has been in the process of increasing svgl s production capacity 
in august  as part of this expansion  the company purchased from the perkin elmer corporation a  square foot facility subsequently increased by the company to  square feet occupied by svgl in wilton  connecticut and an additional  square foot building  which svgl now occupies  in ridgefield  connecticut 
the company has invested in significant capital improvements related to the buildings purchased and the equipment required to expand the production capabilities of svgl 
while the company has essentially completed its facility expansion activities  it has not invested in all of the metrology and other equipment required to maximize manufacturing capacity 
however  the company plans to continue increasing capacity to produce optical components  thus enabling it to quickly respond to customer requirements 
once demand recovers  the timely equipping of facilities to successfully complete the increase in capacity will require the continued recruitment  training and retention of a high quality workforce  as well as the achievement of satisfactory manufacturing results on a scale greater than svgl has attempted in the past 
there can be no assurance that demand will recover or  that if it does  that the company can manage these efforts successfully 
any failure to successfully manage such efforts could result in product delivery delays and a subsequent loss of future revenues 
in particular  the company believes that protracted delays in delivery quantities of current and future micrascan products could result in semiconductor manufacturers electing to install competitive equipment in their advanced fabrication facilities  which could impede acceptance of the micrascan products on an industry wide basis 
this could result in the company s operating results being adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales  for any reason  do not increase commensurately 
the time required to build a micrascan system is significant 
if svgl is to be successful in supplying increased quantities of micrascan systems  it will not only need to be able to build more systems  it will need to build them faster 
svgl will require additional trained personnel  additional raw materials and components and improved manufacturing and testing techniques to both facilitate volume increases and shorten manufacturing cycle time 
to that end  svgl is continuing to develop its vendor supply infrastructure  and implement manufacturing improvements 
additionally  the company believes that as it increases its penetration of the micrascan product  it must resume increasing its factory  field service and technical support organization staffing and infrastructure to support the anticipated customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience manufacturing difficulties or encounter problems in its attempt to increase production and upgrade or expand existing operations 
one of the most critical components of the micrascan systems is the projection optics  which are primarily manufactured by svgl 
as part of its overall investment in capacity  the company has increased svgl s optical manufacturing floor space 
the company believes that in order for svgl to be a viable supplier of advanced lithography systems in the future  it must successfully reduce the cycle times required to build projection optics 
in november  the company acquired tinsley laboratories  inc tli in exchange for approximately  shares of company common stock 
tli designs  manufactures and sells precision optical components  assemblies and systems to customers in a variety of industries and research endeavors 
the primary reasons for the acquisition were tli s technology and expertise relating to aspherical lenses  a key component of svgl s photolithography products  the adaptation of certain of tli s manufacturing processes by svgl and tli s commencement of the fabrication of non aspherical lenses which are currently produced by svgl 
however  there can be no assurance that tli s manufacturing technology is scaleable  or that such expertise can be transferred without substantial time or expense  if at all 
the inability of svgl to transfer this production technology for use in processes of a substantially larger scale or the inability of tli to manufacture non aspherical lenses for svgl in sufficient quantities to realize efficiencies of scale could adversely affect the company s ability to realize any significant benefits from the acquisition of tli 
the company believes that protracted delays in delivering quantities of both current and future generations of micrascan products to multiple worldwide customers could result in semiconductor manufacturers electing to install competitive equipment in their advanced fabrication facilities  and could preclude industry acceptance of the micrascan technology and products 
in addition  the company s operating results could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity and field service and technical support activities if net sales do not increase commensurately 
svgl sole source materials and components 
most raw materials and components not produced by the company are available from more than one supplier 
however  certain raw materials  components and subassemblies are obtained from single sources or a limited group of suppliers 
although the company seeks to reduce its dependence on these sole and limited source suppliers  and the company has not experienced significant production delays due to unavailability or delay in procurement of component parts or raw materials to date  disruption or termination of certain of these sources could occur and such disruptions could have at least a temporary adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
moreover  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations and could result in damage to customer relationships 
the raw material for a proprietary component of the optical system for the micrascan is available from only one supplier 
the supplier has expanded its capacity to meet svgl s projected long term requirements and has created and stored agreed upon quantities of safety stock 
there can be no assurance that the supplier will be able to provide acceptable quantities of material required by svgl 
additionally  a version of the company s micrascan iii photolithography system utilizes an excimer laser that is manufactured in volume by only one supplier 
in fiscal svgl qualified an additional source of lasers for its current and future versions of micrascan products  allowing the potential for the integration of such lasers into its system configurations 
however  there can be no assurance that its customers will be receptive to procuring products with lasers from this supplier  or the supplier will be able to provide product of sufficient quantity and quality 
if these suppliers were unable to meet their commitments  svgl would be unable to manufacture the quantity of products required to meet the anticipated future demand  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
it is anticipated that a critical component of the optical system for the nanometer lithography product  which is currently under development  will utilize calcium fluoride 
calcium fluoride is a raw material that has been known to be in short supply and is integral to the production of optics capable of producing quality line widths of 
and below 
the company has or will shortly qualify three suppliers who could be sources of this raw material for the company 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will be able to supply the quality or quantity of the product necessary for the company to meet expected future demand  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results on operations 
svgl research and development funding 
historically  the company has depended on external funding to assist in the high cost of development in its photolithography operation 
beginning in fiscal  the company entered into agreements with certain customers the participants whereby each agreed to assist in funding the company s development of an advanced technology nanometer micrascan system 
in exchange for such funding  each participant received the right to purchase one such system and  in addition  received a right of first refusal ratable among such participants to all such machines manufactured during the first two years following the initial system shipments 
for each initial system ordered  each participant agreed to fund  in such development costs 
the agreements call for each participant to pay  of initial development funding and four subsequent payments of  upon the completion of certain development milestones 
the participants may withdraw from the development program without penalty  but payments made against completed development milestones are not refundable and all rights to future equipment are forfeited 
at september   the company had received and recognized  in funding from program participants against research and development expenditures 
three competitors of the company have either announced the development of  or have shipped nanometer products 
in june  certain participants decided that their product needs have changed for initial nanometer machines and have withdrawn from the program and chosen to use or are evaluating other solutions 
at september   the company s obligations under these agreements are complete and no additional funding is expected or required from the participants 
in may  the company entered into an agreement with intel corporation intel for the development of nanometer lithography technology 
this agreement obligates the company among other things to develop and sell to intel a predetermined number of initial tools 
intel has agreed to provide advanced payments for the development and manufacture of these machines  based upon predetermined milestones 
separately  intel has invested approximately  in the company in the form of a purchase of series convertible preferred stock see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is obligated to dedicate a certain amount of its nanometer unit production output to intel 
the company is required to use the proceeds from the series preferred investment and funds received under the agreement for the development of technology for use on nanometer lithography equipment 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing nanometer technology or will be able to manufacture significant quantities of machines to satisfy its obligations to intel or other customers 
there is no assurance that the company will receive all funding which it currently anticipates or that it will be able to obtain future outside funding beyond that which it is currently receiving  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
if the company were required to use its own funds  its research and development expenses would increase and its operating income would be reduced correspondingly 
svgl market penetration 
the company believes that for svgl to succeed in the long term  it must expand its customer base and sell its micrascan products on a global basis 
the japanese market including fabrication plants operated outside japan by japanese semiconductor manufacturers  the taiwanese market and the korean market represent a substantial portion of the overall market for photolithography exposure equipment 
to date  the company has not been successful penetrating any of these markets 
economic difficulties in certain asian economies  particularly korea  may adversely effect the company s ability to penetrate such markets 
svgl future profitability 
if svgl is to attain its objective of being a volume supplier of advanced photolithography products to multiple customers  the company believes that it must expand its customer base to include additional customers from whom it secures and successfully fulfills orders for production quantities of micrascan products 
the company believes that in light of the recent downturn in industry demand  costs associated with the continued development of the micrascan technology  the expansion of svgl s manufacturing capacity  the related increase in manpower and customer support  increased competition and the potential difficulties inherent in developing and manufacturing sub 
micron micrascan products  in particular the projection optics required for these products  there can be no assurance that svgl will be able to operate profitably in the future 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will continue to depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of its executive officers and key management and technical personnel 
in particular  svgl s future growth is very dependent on the company s ability to attract and retain key skilled employees  particularly those related to the optical segment of its business 
the company is a party to agreements with each of its executive officers to help ensure the officers continual service to the company in the event of a change in control 
each of the company s executive officers  and key management and technical personnel would be difficult to replace 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key personnel  or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
legal proceedings 
on or about august   fullman international inc and fullman company llc collectively  fullman initiated a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of oregon alleging claims for fraudulent conveyance  constructive trust and declaratory relief in connection with a settlement the company had previously entered into resolving its claims against a thailand purchaser of the company s equipment 
in its complaint against the company  fullman  allegedly another creditor of the thailand purchaser  alleges damages of approximately  plus interest 
the company has successfully moved to transfer the case to the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the trial is tentatively scheduled for july while the outcome of such litigation is uncertain  the company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and intends to conduct a vigorous defense 
however  an unfavorable outcome in this matter could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
on july   the company filed a complaint for copyright infringement to protect its investment and intellectual property from six third party vendors the defendants subsequently complaints against two of the defendants were withdrawn by the company 
the complaint was filed against the defendants alleging that the named defendants have infringed upon certain copyrights owned by the company on its x series equipment by duplicating or modifying software in the refurbishment and sale of replacement boards 
the complaint further asks for preliminary and permanent injunction against the defendants further infringement of the company s copyrights and sale of infringing systems and boards  and for an award of damages 
one of the defendants has filed a counterclaim against the company in response to the company s complaint 
in addition to the above  the company  from time to time  is party to various legal actions arising out of the normal course of business  none of which is expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in june and june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
these statements require companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company is required to adopt sfas for the fiscal year ending september  although the company has not fully assessed the impact of adoption  management believes that the adoption of these statements will not have a significant impact on its financial results 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab summarizes certain interpretations and practices followed by the division of corporation finance and the office of the chief accountant of the sec in administering the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
although the company has not fully assessed the impact of adoption  management believes that applying the guidance in this bulletin will not have a significant impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company attempts to minimize its currency fluctuation risk by actively managing the balances of current assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
during fiscal the company did not use foreign currency hedging transactions  however it is the company s intent during fiscal to sell forward contracts in japanese yen in order to hedge foreign currency exposures 
at september  the company had investments in marketable debt securities that are subject to interest rate risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  due to the short term nature of the company s debt investments and the company s ability to hold it s fixed income investments to maturity the impact of a interest rate change would not have a material impact on the value of such investments 
at september  fixed rate debt obligations totaled  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fixed rate obligations range between to with a weighted average of and maturity dates through february certain of the company s manufacturing facilities are leased under operating lease agreements under which the monthly rent payments adjust based on libor 
monthly rent payments are variable at to over libor 
for one of the leases  the company has entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the interest rate and therefore  the lease payment 
for the other lease  the company has income and cash flow exposure to the extent that libor changes 
the impact of a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the amount of lease payment
