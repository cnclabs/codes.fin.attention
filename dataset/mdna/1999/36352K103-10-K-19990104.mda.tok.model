year compliance until recently  computer programs were generally written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
accordingly  such programs may be unable to distinguish properly between the year and the year this could result in system failures or data corruption for the company  its customers or suppliers which could cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in business activities or to receive information  services  raw materials and supplies  or payment from suppliers  customers or business partners or any other companies with which the company conducts business 
the company  including the acquired business  has developed a comprehensive plan intended to address year issues 
as part of the plan  the company has selected a team to identify  evaluate and implement remediation efforts aimed at bringing the company s information technology and non information technology systems into year compliance prior to december  during fiscal  the team completed its assessment of the company s information technology and non information technology systems 
additionally  the company has engaged an independent consulting firm that specializes in implementing and reviewing year programs 
such firm has evaluated significant portions of the company s remediation plan and has identified improvements to the company s overall remediation efforts 
the company s information technology remediation efforts are substantially complete and the company s significant efforts in fiscal will consist of testing the updated systems 
it is anticipated that additional remediation efforts resulting principally from the testing procedures will be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
the company has also prioritized and completed the significant steps of its non information technology systems plan 
the company s remaining remediation efforts related to non information technology systems are expected to be completed during fiscal if the company s remaining remediation efforts are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
based upon the remediation efforts completed  the company does not believe a formal contingency plan will be required 
individual locations or business units will develop informal contingency plans in the event that they do not expect to be fully year compliant within the current time estimates 
to date  the cost of the company s year assessment and remediation efforts has not been material to the company s results of operations or liquidity 
the total expenditures in fiscal to remediate the company s year issues  inclusive of its ongoing systems initiatives is not expected to exceed million 
the company is funding the expenditures related to the year plan with cash flows from operations 
the capitalization or expense of the foregoing expenditures will be determined using current authoritative guidance 
the company is also communicating with its significant suppliers  customers and business partners to coordinate year conversion efforts 
additionally  during fiscal the company will be contacting second tier suppliers to assess their year readiness 
currently  the company is unaware of any material exposures or contingencies in regards to these parties 
however  the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the event these parties do not become year capable on a timely basis 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies legacy currencies and the euro 
between january  and december   the euro will be used solely for non cash transactions 
during this time period  the euro will be traded on currency exchanges and will be the basis of valuing legacy currencies 
the legacy currencies will continue to be legal tender 
beginning january   the participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions  and no later than july   will withdraw all bills and coins denominated in the legacy currencies 
the legacy currencies will then no longer be legal tender for any transactions 
the company s european operations export the majority of its sales to countries that are participating countries 
as the european pricing policy has historically been based on local currencies  the company believes that as a result of the euro conversion the uncertainty of the effect of exchange rate fluctuations will be greatly reduced 
in addition  the company s principal competitors are also located within the participating countries 
the company believes that the conversion to the euro will eliminate much of the advantage or disadvantage coming from exchange rate fluctuation resulting from transactions involving legacy currencies in participating countries 
accordingly  competitiveness will be solely based on price  quality and service 
while the company believes the increased competitiveness based on these factors will provide the company with a strategic advantage over smaller local companies  it cannot assess the magnitude of this impact on its operations 
the company s euro conversion plan provides for the invoicing of products in both local currencies and euro beginning january  however  the conversion of the company s financial reporting and information systems will not begin until the company s fiscal year 
the company believes the euro conversion will be completed prior to the beginning of its fiscal year and the costs related to the conversion will not be material to the company s operating results although no assurances can be made in this regard

 reporting comprehensive income  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   the company s fiscal year fas requires that the company report comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
comprehensive income represents the change in stockholder s equity during the period from nonowner sources 
currently  changes from nonowner sources consist of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments 
in june  the fasb issued fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  effective for years beginning after december   the company s fiscal year fas requires that a public company report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments pursuant to criteria that differ from current accounting practice 
operating segments  as defined  are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the financial information to be reported includes segment profit or loss  certain revenue and expense items and segment assets and reconciliations to corresponding amounts in the general purpose financial statements 
fas also requires information about products and services  geographic areas of operation  and major customers 
the company has not completed its analysis of the effect of adoption on its financial statement disclosure  however  the adoption of fas will not affect results of operations or financial position  but may affect the disclosure of segment information 
in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for years beginning after june   the company s fiscal year fas requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives would be either offset against the change in the fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value would immediately be recognized in earnings 
the company has not yet determined what the effect of fas will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of its subsidiaries functional currency as compared to the currencies of its foreign denominated sales and purchases 
foreign currency options and forward contracts and natural offsets are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries in which the company manufactures or sells its products would not be material 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and related expenses  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
cotton commodity exposures purchase contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations in the price of raw material cotton 
increases or decreases in the market price of cotton may effect the fair value of cotton commodity purchase contracts
