impact of the year the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four digits  to define the applicable year 
any of the programs used in the company s operations that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company has previously instituted a thorough program to identify these computer programs and modify or replace its key financial information and operational systems so that they will function properly in the year remaining financial and operational systems have been assessed  and detailed plans have been developed and are being implemented to make the necessary modifications to ensure year compliance 
the financial impact of making the required system changes for year compliance are not expected to have any material effect on the company s financial statements 
however  even as the company s assessment is completed without identifying any material non compliant systems operated by  or in the control of  the company  or of third parties  the most reasonable likely worse case scenario would be a systems failure beyond the control of the company to remedy 
such a failure could materially prevent the company from operating its business 
the company believes that such a failure could lead to lost revenues  increased operating cost  or other business interruptions of a material nature
