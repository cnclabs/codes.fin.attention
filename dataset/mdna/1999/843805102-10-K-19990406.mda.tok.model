item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview 
this analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of southern security life should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and financial statements and notes to the financial statements included in this report 
in recent years the company has primarily issued two types of insurance products  universal life and final expense products 
universal life provides insurance coverage with flexible premiums  within limits  which allow policyholders to accumulate cash values 
the accumulated cash values are credited with tax deferred interest  as adjusted by the company on a periodic basis 
deducted from the cash accumulations are administrative charges and mortality costs 
should a policy surrender in its early years  the company assesses a surrender fee against the cash value accumulations based on a graded formula 
final expense products are traditional endowment type insurance policies written for the senior market 
because they are written to a senior market they are designed to accommodate adverse health conditions 
because of the size of the policies they are usually issued with only limited underwriting 
the coverage size of the policy is roughly equivalent to the insured s anticipated funeral costs 
pursuant to the accounting methods prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  premiums received from policyholders on universal life products are credited to policyholder account balances and treated as a liability rather than income 
revenues on such products result from the mortality and administrative fees charged to policyholder balances in addition to surrender charges assessed at the time of surrender as explained above 
such costs of insurance  expense charges  and surrender charges are recognized as revenue is earned 
in addition  the company has adopted policy designs with the characteristic of having higher expense charges during the first policy year than in renewal years 
under sfas  the excess of these charges are reported as unearned revenue 
the unearned revenue is then amortized into income over the life of the policy using the same assumptions and factors used to amortize capitalized acquisition costs 
interest credited to policyholder balances is shown as a part of benefit expenses 
premiums received from final expense products are treated as revenue when received 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  certain costs directly associated with the issuance of new policies are deferred and amortized over the lives of the policies 
these costs are defined as deferred policy acquisition costs and are shown in the asset section of the balance sheet of the company 
capitalized acquisition costs for universal life and annuity policies are amortized over the life of the business at a constant rate  based on the present value of the estimated gross profits expected to be realized over the life of the business 
sfas requires that estimates of expected gross profits used as a basis for amortization be evaluated on a regular basis  and the total amortization to date be adjusted as a charge or credit to earnings if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates be revised 
thus  variations in the amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs  from one period to the next  are a normal aspect of the universal life insurance business and are generally attributed to the recognition of current and emerging experience in accordance with the principles of sfas annuity products  of which the company currently has a minor amount  are recorded in similar fashion to universal life products 
considerations received by the company are credited to the annuity account balances which are shown as a liability in the balance sheet 
interest is credited to these accounts as well and shown as an expense of the company 
income is derived primarily from surrender charges on this type product 
an additional source of income to the company is investment revenue 
the company invests those funds deposited by policy holders of universal life and annuity products in debt and equity securities in order to earn interest and dividend income  a portion of which is credited back to the policyholders 
interest rates and maturities of the company s investment portfolio play a part in determining the interest rates credited to policyholders 
product profitability is affected by several different factors  such as mortality experience actual versus expected  interest rate spreads excess interest earned over interest credited to policyholders and controlling policy acquisition costs and other costs of operation 
the results of any one reporting period may be significantly affected by the level of death claims or other policyholder benefits incurred due to the company s relatively small size

new business written was million  million and million in face value for  and  respectively 
the company s new market is known as the final expense market 
this product is a traditional endowment policy designed to help offset the financial burdens associated with the death of a family member and targets the needs of senior citizens 
the product represented of the life policies written in recruiting new field sales representatives is directed at this new plan 
policies issued in this market are of a lesser face value than those of the universal life market 
that being the case  the face amount of insurance appears to have declined  however  the actual number of policies issued increased 
the company issued approximately  new policies in and approximately  new policies in net insurance revenue was million in  million in  and million in while policy production was up for and  premium and policy charges were down due to the type and size of plans written in the respective years 
several factors have combined to create the decline in net insurance revenue in as compared to and continued lapsation in the universal life book of business has resulted in reduced revenues in administrative and mortality fees 
new production has not increased as significantly as would be needed to offset policy lapses and the new product currently being marketed has lower premiums due to the size of policies currently issued as compared to the universal life product 
surrender fee income in decreased by approximately  compared to due to the decrease in surrender charges applicable to the company s older universal life products 
the balance of the decline in  and premium and policy charges is related to the unlocking  for current and future experience  of unearned revenue 
unearned revenue essentially represents the excess first year charges in the policy 
with the advice and assistance of consulting actuaries  each year the company reviews its current experience for mortality  credited interest spreads  lapses  surrender fees and adjusts its amortization of deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue to the appropriate levels for both the current experience and anticipated future experience 
this is an ongoing refinement process 
increased investment in debt securities coupled with reduced expenses for student loan processing are responsible for the net yield in  in and in no substantive changes occurred in compared to previous years 
the company continues to review its investment strategies to increase its earned interest rate 
as a part of this process of review and refinement  the company sold its entire stock portfolio just prior to year end this created a significant increase in realized gains for the resulting funds were reinvested in common stocks and fixed maturities which created an increased yield for the company in and annuity  death and other benefits decreased  or in as compared to an increase of in the decrease in death claims in represent the majority of this reduction 
this expense line is a combination of several benefit types with death claims  annuity benefits and surrender benefits comprising the most significant portion of the total line 
in each of these expenses increased with death claims representing the largest increase 
a significant increase or decrease in death claims in any given year can have a marked impact on the results of operations in a small company 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased in by as compared to a increase in no substantive change occurred in as compared to the previous years 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs is a continuous refinement process which relates to current experience in connection with revenues  mortality gains and losses  credited interest rate spreads  expense charges and surrender charges 
the change in the unearned revenue liabilities is also due to unlocking for current and future experience based on the results of the changing experience encountered as required under fas operating expenses for the company were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
new products and lead programs are responsible for the increased operating costs of and the increase in of  or was primarily attributed to a lump sum settlement to the company s former president to fulfil the obligations of his employment agreement

however  in no event can the agreement be terminated prior to december  it is anticipated that the company will realize a reduced level of general and administrative costs in the future as a result of the administrative services agreement

sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires investments in all debt securities and those equity securities with readily determinable market values to be classified into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
classification of investments is based upon management s current intent 
debt securities which management has a positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as securities held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities held to maturity  are not reflected in the financial statements 
debt and equity securities that are purchased for short term resale are classified as trading securities 
trading securities are carried at market value  with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings 
the company has no trading securities 
all other debt and equity securities not included in the above two categories are classified as securities available for sale 
securities available for sale are carried at market value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income and included in stockholders equity  net of tax and adjustments to deferred acquisition costs

the company s insurance operations have historically provided adequate positive cash flow enabling the company to continue to meet operational needs as well as increase its investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
student loans are a service the company has historically made available to the public as well as an investment 
while the company anticipates the seasonal demand for student loan funds and the subsequent sale of such loans to the student loan marketing association slma  there are times when additional funds are required to meet demand for student loans until such time as the sale thereof to slma can be completed 
in the company renewed its  line of credit with slma until in order to meet these seasonal borrowing requirements 
the company made no draws against this line of credit throughout the seasonal period for or the company anticipates borrowings to be made through this line of credit with slma if student loan borrowings are required for the seasonal period 
slma offers a more competitive rate of interest on such borrowings than the company has been able to obtain through banks 
the company began a new association with usa group  cap program in  for the purpose of making more student loan funds available without increased costs to the company 
this association aided in eliminating borrowings for and the national association of insurance commissioners  in order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency  issued a model law to implement risk based capital rbc requirements for life insurance companies  which are designed to assess capital adequacy 
pursuant to the model law  insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action 
at december   the company had statutory surplus well in excess of any rbc action level requirements 
the company has fully leased all available rental space in its principal office building and does not anticipate further capital expenditures to the rental space 
year the company is currently completing its efforts to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of information by the company s insurance systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company has substantially completed necessary system upgrades and compliance testing and expects to be entirely complete by september  the company s most significant operational system is currently being replaced through conversion pursuant to an administrative services agreement 
under the administrative services agreement entered into by the company effective december   security national made available a new lifepro administration system 
life pro is a subsidiary of ibm 
since may of  security national has invested in excess of million to implement a system conversion for the company 
for further discussion on the administrative services agreement  see the results of operations section discussion on operating expenses 
anticipated future costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
management believes that manual policy and claims administration could be performed in the unlikely event that one or more of its systems did not function 
the company plans to devote the necessary resources to test and remediate all remaining year issues in a timely manner 
the cost that has been incurred and paid in achieving year compliance is approximately million as discussed above 
as of december   management does not anticipate any other significant costs to be incurred associated with its year initiatives
