earnings from continuing operations recorded in fiscal year were  or per diluted share  an increase of compared to earnings from continuing operations of  or per diluted share in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the increased volume and controlled costs 
discontinued operations see note m to notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the operations that were discontinued in fiscal years and net earnings net earnings were  or 
per diluted share in fiscal year compared to  or per diluted share and  or 
per diluted share in fiscal year and  respectively 
the losses from discontinued operations  referred to in the previous paragraph  resulted in lower net earnings in fiscal year as compared to liquidity and capital resources in september  the company amended a revolving line of credit agreement with a major domestic bank 
the amendment provided for a  term loan and a revolving line of credit of  the term loan matures in five years with an amortization of seven years 
the effective interest rate  after including a interest rate swap negotiated with the trust company of the same domestic bank  is percent per annum plus a 
to fees based on financial covenants 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to pay the settlement agreement discussed in note m and to pay down the line of credit 
as of october   the company had  in borrowings outstanding under this revolving line of credit 
the company s ability to satisfy its cash requirements is evaluated by analyzing key measures of liquidity applicable to the company 
the following table is a summary of the liquidity measures which management believes to be significant 
working capital    current ratio to to to debt to total capitalization 
to 
to 
to management believes that the company continues to maintain a strong liquidity position 
the increase in working capital at october   as compared to october   is due mainly to an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and inventories 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and increases in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
operating cash flows decreased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to payments made for the settlement of the natwest litigation and decreased levels of billings in excess of costs and earnings  partially offset by increased collections on accounts receivable 
operating cash flows decreased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the disposition of net assets of discontinued operations  partially offset by increased net income 
capital expenditures totaled  during fiscal year compared to  during fiscal year during fiscal year and the majority of the capital expenditures was for plant expansions of operating facilities at pemco 
management expects the company s capital expenditures program to be approximately  in fiscal year  primarily for additions and replacement of machinery and equipment and the purchase of a facility in north canton  ohio currently being leased 
the company s fiscal year asset management program will continue to focus on the reduction of receivables days outstanding and reduction in inventories 
management believes that the cash and cash equivalents of  at october   along with funds generated from operating activities and funds available through borrowings from the credit line will be sufficient to meet the capital requirements and operating needs of the company for at least the next twelve months 
effects of inflation and recession during the last three years  the company has not experienced any significant effects of inflation on its operations 
management continues to evaluate the potential impact inflation could have on future growth and minimize the impact by including escalation clauses in long term contracts 
recent marketing and financial reports indicate that the current economic conditions should remain in at approximately the same level as and the company does not anticipate significant increases in inflation in the immediate future 
year compliance the year issue results from the historical use in computer software programs and operating systems of a two digit number to represent the year 
certain software and hardware may fail to properly function when confronted with dates that contain as a two digit year 
new information about the nuances of the problem seems to become available on almost a daily basis and that is likely to continue as companies around the world focus increased attention and resources on finding solutions to the problem s many manifestations 
to address the potential risk for disruption of operations  each subsidiary of the company has developed a compliance plan 
the company has substantially completed a comprehensive initial assessment of the readiness of its internal systems and manufacturing systems 
many of the readiness issues identified in internal systems during the course of the initial assessment have already been addressed 
numerous tests have been conducted to confirm the resolution of applied solutions 
additional testing will occur throughout while the company s initial assessment is substantially complete  the company intends to continue to update the assessment of its state of readiness based upon new information that may become available from third party vendors  suppliers and manufacturers in the months to come 
all components originally manufactured by the company are inherently compliant in that the components do not manipulate  process  store or record date related information 
however  a few subsidiaries  including the company s largest subsidiary  powell electrical manufacturing company  sell engineered systems that include potentially noncompliant components manufactured by third parties 
the company is pursuing a plan to evaluate the compliance status of all components manufactured by third parties and will pass through to its customers any compliance warranties provided by the components manufacturers 
the company will continue to strongly recommend to its customers that each make an independent evaluation of the readiness of manufactured products that include potentially noncompliant components 
the transdyn controls  inc subsidiary is a systems integrator of primarily third party products 
as an integrator  transdyn must rely on the readiness information provided by the providers of those third party products 
microsoft is the primary provider of software transdyn utilizes in its integrated systems 
based on currently available information  transdyn believes that the versions of third party products currently integrated into systems it develops are either compliant or will be compliant upon application of readily available patches 
earlier versions of third party products integrated in systems delivered by transdyn in the past are known to be noncompliant  and transdyn will continue to work to identify and notify affected customers 
transdyn is offering its services to affected customers to assist in the testing  retrofit or upgrade process 
the costs to the company to achieve year readiness is not believed to be material 
most tasks associated with compliance plan implementation have been or will be completed by internal employees 
certain tasks will be performed by external solution providers  however  reliance on external resources will not be significant 
the most likely worst case year scenario for the company includes the following possibilities 
a limited number of components manufactured by third parties will fail in some respect despite the manufacturers assurances that such components are compliant 
to the extent that this occurs and the company is obligated to do so under a contractual warranties  the company will make replacement components available to customers 
otherwise  the company will facilitate the identification of viable compliant components and replacement of the noncompliant components 
a limited number of customers who were notified of possible compliance issues associated with older equipment will fail to timely address the issue and will seek assistance from the company after roll over 
to the extent sufficient and appropriate resources are available  the company will facilitate component replacement or upgrades 
some customers may suffer failures that cause those customers to delay placing additional orders of new equipment during the first quarter of or to delay payment for previously ordered products 
the company plans to position itself to adjust to any temporary reduction of new orders and to withstand short term cash flow issues 
one or more physical facilities may suffer some degree of infrastructure failure  due in part to the number of geographic locations of the various subsidiaries 
the company plans to carefully manage its contractual obligations to customers during the first month so as to minimize the effect any infrastructure failure might have on its ability to satisfy those obligations 
at this time  the company does not intend to invest in alternative sources of water  power or telecommunications 
the company will prepare further contingency plans to deal with potential infrastructure failure if and when additional information becomes available from current providers as to their state of readiness 
while other scenarios are possible given the interdependent nature of all businesses  the company believes that the foregoing elements  individually or any combination of one or more other element  represent the most likely worst case scenario
