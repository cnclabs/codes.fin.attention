overview viisage is a leader in the emerging field of biometrics technology and in providing digital identification systems and solutions 
the company focuses on identification solutions that improve personal convenience and security  deter fraud and reduce identification program costs 
viisage combines its systems integration and software design capabilities with its proprietary software and hardware products and other industry standard products to create complete customized solutions 
these turnkey solutions integrate image and data capture  create relational databases  incorporate multiple biometrics and improve customers ability to move and manage information 
applications can include driver s licenses  voter registration  national id s  law enforcement  social services  access control and pc network and internet access security 
to date  viisage s primary customers have been government agencies with particular emphasis on us drivers licensing agencies 
since its inception in  the company has captured approximately of the domestic driver s license market 
viisage products annually produce more than million identification documents at more than  locations in states 
the company has also provided services under subcontracts for projects in jamaica  the philippines and for the us immigration and naturalization service 
the company began operations in as a division of lau technologies lau  a provider of systems integration services and products for sophisticated electronic systems 
in november  lau transferred substantially all of the assets  liabilities and operations of the division to the company and the company completed its initial public offering 
the company is currently a owned subsidiary of lau 
on november   the company s board of directors appointed thomas j 
colatosti  formerly the company s chief operating officer  president and chief executive officer 
during and  the company s revenue growth slowed significantly due primarily to lengthening procurement delays in its principal markets and a strong competitive market place 
the company believes that the acceptance of digital identification technology in recent years  its commitment to providing customized solutions for its customers needs  its expertise in facial imaging and biometric solutions and its proprietary software and hardware products will continue to contribute to its growth 
effective june   the company reorganized its operations to create a separate biometrics division to respond to the growing market interest in biometric solutions 
the biometrics division is focused on product  market and channel development activities in three principal areas facility access control  pc network and internet access security  and real time large database identification and verification of individuals 
the systems integration and identification card division si division focuses on viisage s public sector markets and serves as a channel to existing customers and the public sector for the company s biometric technologies 
the company believes that it is in the early stages of an emerging and high growth market for biometric identification solutions  particularly facial recognition solutions in the government and commercial markets 
in september  the company s technology partner and principal shareholder  lau  was awarded a million development contract for facial recognition systems by the us department of defense which involved viisage as a subcontractor 
the company believes that the leadership from the federal government in using facial biometrics as well as other recent awards and oem arrangements validates the company s technology and helps create credibility for the emerging global market 
the company is engaged in one business  the development and implementation of digital identification systems and solutions 
as discussed above  since june   the company has operated in two segments 
amounts for the biometrics division prior to the reorganization are not material or meaningful 
the si division provides systems and services principally under contracts that have five to seven year terms and provide for several annual renewals after the initial contract term 
contracts generally provide for a fixed price for the system and or for each card produced 
contract prices vary depending on  among other things  design and integration complexities  the nature and number of workstations and sites  the projected number of cards to be produced  the size of the database  the level of post installation support and the competitive environment 
substantially all of the company s revenues are currently derived from the si division s public sector customers and contractors to such customers 
the company believes for the foreseeable future that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of large contracts 
for the years ended december   and  three customers  one customer and two customers  respectively  each accounted for more than of the company s revenues and an aggregate of  and of revenues for each of the years  respectively 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by  among other things  the timing of award and performance on contracts 
as a result  the company s revenues and income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and comparisons over longer periods of time may be more meaningful 
the company s results of operations are not seasonal since contracts are awarded and performed throughout the year 
however  the company believes its public sector business is subject to cyclical procurement delays that may be related to state wide election cycles 
biometric division revenues have not been material to date and operations are not expected to be seasonal

the company previously capitalized certain start up costs as pre contract costs under sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and charged such costs to contracts upon award 
as required  the adoption of sop has been made effective as of the beginning of the year

liquidity and capital resources at december   working capital was million compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital is due primarily to the charges and accounting change discussed above 
for the year ended december   operations and investing activities utilized cash of approximately million and million  respectively  principally to fund operating losses and increases in project assets 
financing was provided primarily by long term borrowings and the project lease financing arrangement referred to below 
at december   the company was not in compliance with certain covenants included in its revolving credit and project lease financing facilities 
the company has received waivers of such violations from its lenders and commitments from its lenders to modify the company s covenants in line with its current operating plan 
in connection with the bank s commitment  the revolving credit facility will be amended to provide for borrowings of up to million through september   million through december   and million through june  at the prime rate plus 
the revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of earnings and tangible capital funds  as defined 
the revolving credit facility also requires the company to raise funds  as needed  from other sources to cover biometrics division expenses 
these sources are expected to include a combination of biometrics division revenues  subordinated debt and equity capital 
the company also has a system project lease financing arrangement with a commercial leasing organization 
pursuant to this arrangement  the lessor purchases certain of the company s digital identification systems and leases them back to viisage for deployment with identified and contracted customers approved by the lessor 
the lessor retains title to systems and has an assignment of viisage s rights under the related customer contracts  including rights to use the software and technology underlying the related systems 
under this arrangement  the lessor bears the credit risk associated with payments by viisage s customers  but viisage bears performance and appropriation risk and is generally required to repurchase a system in the event of a termination by a customer for any reason except credit default 
the company is also required to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible capital funds  as defined 
as discussed above  the company was not in compliance with certain covenants  but has received waivers and a commitment to amend the covenants to be consistent with the company s current operating plan 
these project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases 
the current arrangement provides for project financing of up to million  which has been reduced from million to reflect the company s current operations 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under the lease financing arrangement  and is currently seeking additional project financing arrangements 
lau has agreed to provide up to million of capital lease financing in the company believes that it will meet its revised debt covenants 
however  this expectation is dependent in part on achieving business forecasts and raising funds to cover biometrics division expenses 
if the company does not meet such covenants  the bank and the lessor could require immediate repayment of amounts outstanding 
during the third quarter  the company issued  shares of common stock to lau technologies lau  its majority shareholder  for per share or  the company also issued  options to lau during the third quarter as a financing fee for lau s guarantee of certain capital lease financing drawdowns 
the options are exercisable through august at per share 
in november  the company also issued an  convertible subordinated note to lau 
the note and related accrued interest are convertible into the company s common stock at any time prior to october  at per share 
the company has historically not made substantial capital expenditures for facilities  office and computer equipment and has satisfied its needs in these areas principally through leasing 
the company believes that it will require at least million of additional funding in order to comply with certain covenants in its lending agreements 
the company has a commitment from lau for up to million of additional funding which can be drawn  under certain conditions defined in the commitment  at various times through february and plans to raise additional funding  as needed  from other sources 
the company believes that if it meets its business forecast for  cash flows from available borrowings  project leasing  operations and capital raising will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional capital will be available on favorable terms or at all 
if the company is unable to obtain additional capital  as needed  on acceptable terms the company may be unable to take full advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to obtain additional capital could also result in violation of debt and project lease financing covenants 
inflation although certain of the company s expenses increase with general inflation in the economy  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results to date 
accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  which establishes standards for disclosing information about an entity s capital structure

 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and disclosure of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
these statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and require certain additional disclosures 
the adoption of these statements did not have a significant impact on the company s current disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes standards for reporting and disclosure of information about operating segments as well as disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
as required  the company adopted sfas no 
in the fourth quarter and has provided the required financial disclosures for the systems integration and identification card and biometrics divisions 
market risk except for the company s revolving credit facility  which has a variable interest rate  the company has no material exposure to market risk that could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
year the company continues to assess the potential impact of the year on the company s internal business systems  products  and operations 
the company s year initiatives include i testing and upgrading internal business systems and facilities  ii testing and developing necessary upgrades for the company s current products and certain discontinued products  iii contacting key suppliers  vendors  and customers to determine their year compliance status  and iv developing contingency plans 
the company s accounting and information systems provider  lau  has advised the company that its internal business systems are year compliant 
the company expects that its facilities will be year compliant by the end of and problems encountered  if any  will be remedied by the owners of such facilities 
the company believes that all of the material products that it currently sells are year compliant or can be made compliant with minor modifications 
however  as many of the company s products are complex  interact with third party products  and operate on computer systems that are not under the company s control  there can be no assurance that the company has identified all of the year issues with its current products 
the company is continuing to test and evaluate such products and may offer upgrades to alternative products where reasonably practicable 
the company is in the process of identifying and contacting suppliers  vendors  and customers that are believed to be significant to the company s business operations in order to assess their year readiness 
as part of this effort  the company is developing questionnaires relating to year compliance for distribution to its significant suppliers  vendors  and customers 
the company intends to follow up and monitor the year compliant progress of significant suppliers  vendors  and customers that indicate that they are not year compliant or that do not respond to the company s questionnaires 
the company intends to develop a contingency plan that will allow its primary business operations to continue despite disruptions due to year issues 
these plans may include identifying and securing other suppliers  increasing inventories  and modifying production facilities and schedules 
as the company continues to evaluate the year readiness of its products and significant suppliers  vendors  and customers  it will modify and adjust its contingency plan as may be required 
to date  costs incurred in connection with the year issue have not been material 
the company does not expect total year remediation costs to be material  but there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter unexpected costs or delays in achieving year compliance 
if any of the company s material suppliers  vendors  or customers experience business disruptions due to year issues  the company might also be materially adversely affected 
while the company is attempting to minimize any negative consequences arising from the year issue  there can be no assurance that year issues will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operations  or financial condition 
certain factors that may affect future results the company operates in an environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
forward looking statements in this document and those made from time to time by the company through its senior management are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements concerning future plans or results are necessarily only estimates and actual results could differ materially from expectations 
certain factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  among other things  potential fluctuations in quarterly results  the size and timing of award and performance on contracts  dependence on large contracts and a limited number of customers  lengthy sales and implementation cycles  changes in management estimates incident to accounting for contracts  availability and cost of key components  market acceptance of new or enhanced products and services  proprietary technology and changing technology  competitive conditions  system performance  management of growth  dependence on key personnel  risks of year issues  and general economic and political conditions and other factors affecting spending by customers
