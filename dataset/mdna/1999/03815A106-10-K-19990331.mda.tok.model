certain of the company s hong kong subsidiaries have million in trade finance lines of credit  payable on demand  which are secured by the subsidiaries tangible and intangible property located in hong kong and in the people s republic of china  as well as a company guarantee 
at december   the hong kong subsidiaries were utilizing  including letters of credit  approximately million of these credit lines 
outstanding borrowings by the company s hong kong subsidiaries are primarily in us dollars 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are its cash flow from operations and borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities 
the company is currently borrowing million under the term loan portion of its senior secured credit facilities 
the senior secured revolving credit facility as amended  provides for borrowings by the company of up to million through december  and million thereafter and through the remainder of the term of the loan

swing line loans will bear interest at the base rate 
the senior credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the real and personal property  tangible and intangible  of the company and its domestic subsidiaries  as well as a pledge of all of the stock of such domestic subsidiaries  a pledge of not less than of the voting stock of each direct foreign subsidiary of the company and each direct foreign subsidiary of each domestic subsidiary of the company  and a pledge of all of the capital stock of any subsidiary of a subsidiary of the company that is a borrower under the senior credit facilities 
the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by all of the current and will be guaranteed by all of the future domestic subsidiaries of the company 
the senior credit facilities contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  prepay other indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock  enter into certain investments or create new subsidiaries  enter into sale and lease back transactions  make certain acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  create liens  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and that otherwise restrict corporate and business activities

based upon the current level of operations and anticipated cost savings and revenue growth  management believes that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under the senior credit and other facilities  will be adequate to meet the company s future liquidity needs for at least the next several years 
the company may  however  need to refinance all or a portion of the principal of the indebtedness on or prior to maturity 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available under the senior secured credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness  including the notes  or to fund its other liquidity needs 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effect any such refinancing on commercially reasonable terms or at all

the company anticipates that the total capital expenditures for will be approximately million  which includes the cost of new tooling 
the company plans to fund those capital expenditures from cash flow from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility

sale of salton shares on july   the company consummated the sale of its  shares of salton stock 
the shares were sold for per share in cash plus a six and one half year  million subordinated promissory note bearing interest at per annum 
the note is to be offset by of the total purchase price paid by salton for product purchases from the company and its affiliates during the term of the note 
in addition  salton repurchased for approximately million an option owned by the company to purchase  shares of salton stock 
the company s after tax proceeds from the transaction were approximately million following the repayment of a million note due salton resulting in an after tax gain of approximately million 
in accordance with the provisions of the company s senior secured credit facilities million of the net proceeds from the salton transaction were used to repay million and million of the tranche a term loan and the tranche b term loan  respectively 
currency matters while the company transacts business predominantly in us dollars and most of its revenues are collected in us dollars  a portion of the company s costs  such as payroll  rent and indirect operations costs  are denominated in other currencies  such as chinese renminbi  hong kong dollars and mexican pesos 
changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect the company s cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the company s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
the company uses forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party raw material and other operating purchases as well as trade receivables 
the purpose of the company s foreign currency management activity is to reduce the risk that eventual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
durable uses the hong kong dollar as its functional currency 
the hong kong dollar has historically been pegged to a fixed exchange rate vis a vis the us dollar 
if the hong kong dollar were to be significantly devalued against the us dollar and the exchange rate allowed to fluctuate  the company could experience significant changes in its currency translation account which would impact the company s future comprehensive income 
the company has acquired the queretaro property and related assets from the black decker corporation 
because the operations of such facilities are primarily peso denominated and the revenues derived from products manufactured at such facilities are primarily dollar denominated  the company is now subject to fluctuations in the value of the peso 
the december devaluation of the peso had a number of effects on the mexican economy that adversely affected the financial condition of businesses in mexico 
the devaluation caused the peso value of dollar denominated indebtedness associated with businesses in mexico to increase significantly  and also greatly increased the rate of inflation  resulting in a sharp rise in nominal interest rates on peso denominated financing 
there can be no assurance that the peso to dollar foreign exchange rate will not be volatile in the future and that financial markets will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company uses interest rate swaps of one to four years in duration to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt 
the notional amounts of the agreements are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
the differential paid or received on the agreements is recognized as an adjustment of interest expense 
as of december   the company had purchased interest rate swaps on million notional principal amount with a market value of approximately million 
the market value represents the amount the company would have to pay to exit the contracts at december  the company does not intend to exit such contracts at this time

in  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop provides guidance on accounting for start up costs and organization costs  which must be expensed as incurred 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
seasonality the company s business is highly seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
the company has historically experienced higher revenues in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year primarily due to increased demand by customers for products in the late summer for back to school sales and in the fall for holiday sales 
the company s major sales occur during august through november 
sales are generally made on to day terms 
heaviest collections on its open accounts receivable are received from november through march  at which time the company is in its most liquid state 
year issues the company uses a significant number of computer software programs and operating systems across its entire organization  including applications used in financial business systems  manufacturing and administrative functions 
a complete evaluation has been performed to identify whether any of the company s software applications contain source code that is unable to interpret the upcoming year and beyond 
the appropriate modifications have been made and the company now believes that its critical systems are year compliant 
the company has received communications from its major suppliers and trading partners  some of who have filed reports with the securities and exchange commission  and believes that they are also year compliant 
the cost of implementing required system changes is not material to the company s consolidated financial systems 
no assurance can be given  however  that all of the company s systems  the systems of acquired businesses and those of significant customers and suppliers will not experience year compliance difficulties 
difficulties that arise may result in unfavorable business consequences including disruption in product shipments  delays in receipt of materials  delay in customer receipts and payments to suppliers

the court is presently considering the appointment of lead counsel

because these matters are in their preliminary stages  management is unable at this time to determine what effect these lawsuits will have on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
the company is currently advancing the legal expenses of the directors and officers who were named as defendants 
such defendants have agreed to repay the company for all or any portion of such advances to which they are ultimately found not to be entitled pursuant to applicable law 
based on the information currently available to the company  management does not believe that the indemnification of the officers and directors named as defendants in the above listed matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
however  the actual effects of such indemnification on the company cannot be finally determined until the amount of such indemnification  if any  is fixed 
the company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of ultimate liability  if any  in excess of applicable insurance coverage  is not likely to have a material effect on the financial position of the company 
however  as the outcome of litigation or other claims is difficult to predict  significant changes in the estimated exposures could occur 
commitments and contingencies the company and the other percent owner in newtech have entered into an agreement whereby the company will transfer of its interest in newtech to a third party if and when a liquidity event for the company occurs 
pursuant to the agreement  a liquidity event would occur if newtech sells equity interests in a public offering  newtech is sold to a third party  or if there is an other disposition of the company s interest or other similar event 
manufacturing operations the company s products are manufactured primarily at the company s facilities in the prc  mexico and the united states 
in october  the company announced its intention to close the asheboro  north carolina plant 
prior to the hpg acquisition  the majority of the company s products were manufactured by durable  its wholly owned hong kong subsidiary operating in bao an county  guangdong province of the people s republic of china  which is approximately miles northwest of central  hong kong 
the company has a significant amount of its assets in the people republic  primarily consisting of inventory  equipment and molds 
the supply and cost of products  as well as finished products  can be adversely affected  among other reasons  by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  increased import duties  imposition of tariffs  imposition of import quotas  interruptions in sea or air transportation and political or economic changes 
from time to time  the company explores opportunities to diversify its sourcing and or production of certain products to other low cost locations or with other third parties or joint venture partners other newtech has advised the company that it is in discussions with its lenders regarding noncompliance of certain of its loan covenants 
at december   the company has an investment and receivables from newtech aggregating million

the mexican government exercises significant influence over many aspects of the mexican economy 
accordingly  the actions of the mexican government concerning the economy could have a significant effect on private sector entities in general and the company in particular

as a result of the company s reliance upon manufacturing facilities in mexico  economic conditions in mexico could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is to changing interest rates  debt obligations issued at a fixed rate and fluctuations in the currency exchange rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate instruments  with respect to both its liquid assets and its debt instruments 
the senior credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates  however  the company has purchased interest rate protection for such loans in the form of interest rate swaps 
based on the current amount of variable rate  as well as underlying swaps  the exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
fixed rate debt obligations issued by the company are not callable until july  the company is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
as a general policy  the company hedges foreign currency commitments of future payments and receipts by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts 
as of december   the notional value of such derivatives was million  with no significant unrealized gain or loss 
the majority of the company s receipts and expenditures are contracted in us dollars  and the company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material at this time
