the company s capital and operating requirements may change depending upon various factors  including i the success of the company and its strategic partners in manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of its other products  ii the amount of resources which the company devotes to clinical evaluations and the expansion of marketing and sales capabilities  iii results of clinical trials and research and development activities  and iv competitive and technological developments 
the company s financial objectives are to meet its capital and operating requirements through revenues from existing products  contract manufacturing  license and research contracts  and control of spending 
to achieve its strategic objectives  the company may enter into research and development partnerships and acquire  in license and develop other technologies  products or services 
certain of these strategies may require payments by the company in either cash or stock in addition to the costs associated with developing and marketing a product or technology 
the company currently has no commitments or specific plans for acquisitions or strategic alliances 
however  the company believes that  if successful  such strategies may increase long term revenues 
there can be no assurance as to the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses 
to fund these strategic and operating activities  the company may sell equity and debt securities as market conditions permit or enter into credit facilities 
the company has incurred negative cash flows from operations since its inception  and has expended  and expects to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete its planned product development efforts  including acquisition of products and complementary technologies  research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities  and to further expand its marketing and sales 
the company expects that its existing capital resources as of december   together with decreased operating costs  the million received from the sale of common stock  and the million received from the sale of the manufacturing and laboratory facilities but exclusive of the equity line agreement  will be adequate to fund the company s operations into the year management believes the addition of the equity line agreement  will provide the company with additional cash flow to sustain operations well into year no assurance can be given that the company will not consume a significant amount of its available resources before that time 
in addition  the company expects that it will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when it reaches profitability  for further development of products  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including the successful commercialization of its products  the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with clinical trials  progress with regulatory affairs activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of its products 
to the extent that the currently available funds and revenues including the equity line agreement  the million received from the sale of common stock and the million received from the sale of facilities are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
based on the company s historical ability to raise capital and current market conditions  the company believes other financing alternatives are available 
there can be no assurance that the financing commitments described above or other financial alternatives will be available when needed or at terms commercially acceptable to the company 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  further scale back or eliminate certain aspects of its operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
year compliance the year problem describes the concern that certain computer applications  which use two digits rather than four to represent dates  will interpret the year as and malfunction on january  cytogen s internal systems 
the efficient operation of the company s business is dependent in part on its computer software programs and operating systems collectively  programs and systems 
these programs and systems are used in several key areas of the company s business  including clinical  purchasing  inventory management  sales  shipping  and financial reporting  as well as in various administrative functions 
the company has completed its evaluation of the program and systems to identify any potential year compliance problem 
based on present information  the company believes that it will be able to achieve year compliance through a combination of modifications or replacement of existing programs and systems 
the majority of the company s internal systems have been replaced with fully compliant systems 
the remaining systems are expected to be compliant by april  at a cost of  however  there can be no assurance that the required expenditures will not exceed that amount 
readiness of third parties 
the company is also working with its processing banks  network providers and manufacturing partners to ensure their systems are year compliant 
all these costs will be borne by the processors  network and software companies and manufacturing partners 
currently  the company s processing banks and manufacturing partners are in the process of completing their year compliance programs 
if the manufacturing partners systems fail on january  the company s revenues may be adversely impacted 
in the event that some or all of the processing banks are unable to be year compliant  the company will switch merchant accounts to those that are compliant 
risks associated with the year the company is not aware  at this time  of any year non compliance that will not be fixed by the year however  some risks that the company faces include the failure of internal information systems  defects in its work environment  a slow down in its customers ability to make payments  and the availability of products for sale
