marketing costs were also incurred for the new devry institute in west hills  california  which is scheduled to open in november administrative expenses have also increased from the prior year in part to support continuing efforts by the company related to what is commonly referred to as the yk problem 
in mid  the company initiated a project to determine the magnitude of its exposure from its own systems and from those of significant business partners 
through audit  testing and remediation  the company identified and evaluated the readiness of its information technology it and non it systems  which  if not yk compliant  could have a material effect on the company 
the review and testing of all internal it systems have been completed  and those systems have been made yk compliant through change or replacement 
an inventory of pc hardware and software has been completed  and a plan was developed and implemented to replace any non compliant hardware prior to the end of the calendar year 
software vendors were contacted and are being tracked for follow up as necessary 
an upgrade or replacement plan was developed and implemented for any non compliant software 
critical suppliers of non it goods and services have also been identified and contacted for their compliance status 
in addition  the company is developing a contingency plan  targeted for completion prior to year end  for critical functions at its headquarters and other operating locations

in addition  spending on implementation efforts for the company s new financial system contributed to the increased expense 
the financial system  which has been used for reporting beginning in july  offers enhanced financial controls  reporting and analysis and overcomes yk processing deficiencies in the previous system 
in addition  the company appointed a coordinator with responsibility for all other aspects for the yk project 
efforts were initiated to address the yk processing requirements  focusing initially on mission critical systems and extending to all the company s hardware and software  whether internally developed or purchased  and to ensure compliance by the many providers of products and services to the company 
the company believes that it is on schedule for completion of the project during costs associated with this effort are not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations and are being charged to expense as incurred 
the company s fiscal earnings from operations  before interest and taxes  were a record million 
operating margins  which had been increasing steadily each year  increased again to  up from and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
operating margin increases were generated by improved facility utilization from increased enrollments and by continued operating improvements 
interest expense decreased by million from the prior year  as debt incurred for the acquisition of becker cpa in june was being repaid from cash generated by operations 
net income of million  or per share  was a record for any year  increasing by from fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from student payments for tuition  fees and books 
these payments include cash from student and family educational loans  from other financial aid under various federal  state and provincial programs  and from student and family resources 
the pattern of cash receipts is somewhat seasonal 
the level of accounts receivable from which cash payments are collected reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition  fees and books at the beginning of each of the devry institutes semesters  which begin in july  november and march 
collections of devry institute receivables are heaviest at the start of each semester 
in the first two months of each semester  collections typically exceed payments for operating expenses applicable to that period 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level just prior to the start of the next semester  dropping to their lowest point in the year at the end of june 
the end of june corresponds to both the end of the spring semester and the end of a financial aid year  at which time substantially all financial aid for the previous months has been disbursed to students accounts 
keller graduate school and becker cpa also experience similar seasonality in their cash receipts and expenditures based upon their respective operating cycles 
at june   total company accounts receivable  net of the related reserves  were million  an increase of from last june  approximately the same rate of increase as tuition and other educational revenues for the year 
the company is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of financial aid funds 
the company estimates that historically  approximately of devry institutes tuition  bookstore and fee revenues have been financed by government provided financial aid to its students 
these financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained at current levels 
if funds flow from the federal or state governments is temporarily delayed in conjunction with year processing difficulties  the company could use its available cash resources and borrowings under its revolving term loan agreement until such financial aid funding was restored 
the department of education and most student loan processing agencies report that they are now yk compliant 
extensive and complex regulations in the united states and canada govern all of the government financial assistance programs in which the company s students participate 
the company s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for disciplinary action  including initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding against the company 
under the terms of the company s participation in governmental financial aid programs  certain cash received from the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
this cash becomes available for general use by the company only after student loans and grants have been credited to the accounts of students and the cash is transferred to an unrestricted operating cash account 
at june   cash held in restricted bank accounts was million  largely in anticipation of enrollments and financial aid disbursements at the start of devry institutes summer term 
cash generated from operations in fiscal reached a record million  up million from last year 
higher earnings and the increased non cash sources of depreciation and amortization accounted for the increased cash flow  more than offsetting higher accounts receivable and other working capital account changes 
traditionally  the company has been able to help fund its expansion by operating with very little or even negative working capital whenever necessary 
the generation and use of cash during the year reflects the seasonal operating patterns discussed above 
during some periods just prior to the start of a semester  cash balances may be supplemented by temporary borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
cash generated from operations each year has been sufficient to meet all of the company s operating and capital investment needs while reducing debt on a regular basis 
capital expenditures in fiscal reached another record  totalling million  up million from the previous record level set only last year 
capital expenditures were made for expansion and facility improvements  replacement and upgrading of school laboratories and for teaching and administrative equipment 
contributing to s record spending was the completion of construction on the new devry institute in fremont san francisco  california  and completion of renovations for the new devry institute in long island city  new york  both of which opened for classes in fiscal also  land was purchased for a new devry institute in tinley park chicago  illinois  and construction was started for the new devry institute in west hills los angeles  california and on an expansion of the chicago devry institute campus 
capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to decline somewhat from the record level as construction is completed on the new west hills campus and chicago campus expansion but begins at the new devry institute campus in tinley park 
these new and expanded devry institute campuses  as well as expansion of keller graduate school and becker cpa into new operating sites  plus possible further devry institutes expansion  will continue to require substantial capital spending in the coming years 
cash generated from operations and existing cash resources have been sufficient to meet capital requirements in the past and  with the company s revolving line of credit  is anticipated to be sufficient to cover expansion plans in the future 
in march  the company and its banks renegotiated the company s revolving term loan agreement  extending its term to august   and expanding the range of acquisitions or investments within the terms of the agreement 
in may  the revolving loan agreement was amended again to extend its term to august  at june   only million of the revolving line had been utilized  all for letters of credit 
on july   the company borrowed million under its revolving loan agreement in conjunction with the purchase  for cash  of the operations of denver technical college and conviser duffy cpa review 
future borrowings and or repayments will be based on the company s seasonal cash flow cycle and payment requirements for capital spending and possible future acquisitions 
effective october   the company s bank borrowing interest rate was reduced to a floating rate of prime or libor plus  at the company s option  and has remained at that level based on continued achievement of certain financial ratios 
interest rates are adjustable quarterly  based upon these financial ratios 
at the present time  the company does not have an interest rate swap or other form of protection against increases in the floating rate but does fix the interval of interest rate adjustment on most of its borrowings for periods of up to three months to eliminate some of the possible variability in rates 
the company periodically evaluates its need for additional protection in light of projected changes in interest rate and borrowing levels 
the company believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if needed  the revolving loan facility will be sufficient to fund its operations for the foreseeable future
