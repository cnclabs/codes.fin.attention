graph earnings per share in dollars overview we had a record setting year at herman miller in a number of categories  including sales  net income  earnings per share and economic value added eva 
while we set new reference points for all of these critical measures  we did not achieve our goals for sales and net income growth 
a key reason for our shortfall was a significant decline in industry demand that began to affect our order entry in the third quarter 
we believe the driver behind this change in industry dynamics was the expectation of lower corporate profits in the united states us corporate profits were expected to decline in late calendar and early this was a result of economic difficulties in many international regions 
as we finished fiscal  the outlook had improved 
corporate profits were stronger than anticipated  the us economy was still growing  and demand for our industry s products appeared to be firming up 
this is discussed in more detail under the domestic operations section of this analysis 
this was a year of significant investment for herman miller 
as we expected  capital expenditures increased to an all time high of million 
we also made significant investments in the form of additional operating expenses 
in total  our operating expenses increased million  or percent 
our design and research expenditures increased approximately percent 
our investments were in three primary areas information technology to connect our manufacturing  logistics  customer care and administrative operations  an electronic sales platform  and new products 
these investments are core building blocks that will enable us to implement our strategy  get connected  and change the game in the office furniture industry 
graph eva in millions of dollars despite less than anticipated sales growth  we continued to invest in our future  improve our profitability and set a new record for eva performance 
this was made possible by the continued efforts of our employee owners to reduce and eliminate waste  redeploy or eliminate nonproductive assets  and prioritize our expenditures against our strategic imperatives 
fiscal marked our third year of utilizing eva as our business measurement tool 
as we indicated when we initiated the program  our board of directors had set improvement targets for the initial three year period  and has now established new targets for the next three years 
while establishing targets for the future  we were able to reflect on the eva program and the impact it has had on the company 
we believe there have been numerous benefits from this program  with the most significant being the business literacy of our employee owners 
nearly all of our  employees worldwide have received training in eva 
our employee owners know that capital is not free and that sustainable value is created through continuous improvement and growth 
they also understand that their compensation is directly tied to eva results 
extensive independent market research has demonstrated that eva more closely correlates with shareholder value  in the long run  than any other measure 
and this has been the case for herman miller  over the past four years 
however  it was not true for herman miller in fiscal our eva increased percent  while the value of one share of herman miller common stock declined percent 
we believe that this divergence in share price is a short term phenomenon and that eva will continue to be the best long term predictor of shareholder value 
therefore  again this year  we have presented a summarized calculation of our eva for fiscal   and in addition  we have noted throughout our analysis the impact that changes in performance had on eva 
calculation of economic value added in thousands operating income    divestiture  interest expense on noncapitalized leases    goodwill amortization    other    increase decrease in reserves    capitalized design and research    adjusted operating profit    cash taxes    net operating profit after taxes nopat    weighted average capital employed    weighted average cost of capital cost of capital    economic value added    imputed interest as if the total noncancelable lease payments were capitalized 
the reported current tax provision is adjusted for the statutory tax impact of interest expense 
total assets less noninterest bearing liabilities plus the lifo  doubtful accounts and notes receivable reserves  warranty reserve  amortized goodwill  loss on sale of the german manufacturing operation  deferred taxes  restructuring costs  and capitalized design and research expense 
design and research expense is capitalized and amortized over years 
management s estimate of the weighted average of the minimum equity and debt returns required by the providers of capital 
as you can see  we generated million of eva this year  compared to million last year  and million in in  our eva increased percent  after increasing percent in key drivers net sales over the past three years  our sales have increased at a compound rate of percent 
in fiscal  our sales increased percent  after increasing percent in  and percent in our fiscal result was significantly below our goal of increasing sales percent per annum 
these results brought home two facts 
first  we will be affected from time to time by macro factors that are not in our control 
second  we have just begun our journey to reinvent our industry and ourselves 
graph net sales in millions of dollars as we stated in the overview  much of the year over year decline in growth rates can be attributed to poor industry dynamics in the us based on industry information  we believe that we have continued to gain market share in the us  which is our largest market 
our international markets were also impacted by the economic turmoil in asia and latin america 
in addition  the strong us dollar made it more difficult to compete as an exporter 
each of these topics is expanded upon below 
our leadership team began their work together four years ago 
the first two years  we concentrated on practicing the fundamentals 
we also implemented some of our building blocks  such as eva and lean manufacturing 
in year three  we refined our strategic vision and developed an implementation plan 
this year  we began the implementation 
of course  many of the key competencies and capabilities have been in place for some time  however  we also have areas where the development is still in process 
in the end  we intend to connect our historical strengths with our new capabilities to form new business models that will redefine the competitive playing field 
we know that we will not achieve our aggressive growth goals in each and every year 
however  we continue to believe that  under normal industry conditions  our overall growth strategy is appropriate and attainable 
domestic operations our domestic sales grew percent this year  after growing percent in  and percent in excluding acquisitions  our domestic sales increased percent in  percent in  and percent in individually  none of our acquisitions were material 
our domestic growth has been primarily driven by unit volume increases 
we have not materially changed list prices in over three years 
during  incremental discounts given to customers reduced our net sales by approximately million 
changes in discounts did not have a material impact on our sales in or graph domestic sales growth as a percent bifma herman miller the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma reported that us sales grew approximately percent in the months ended may  after increasing percent in  and percent in given that our growth has exceeded the industry s growth  we believe we have gained market share in each of the past three years 
we believe demand for office furniture in the us is driven by three factors in the macro economy corporate profits  white collar employment  and nonresidential fixed investments 
during fiscal years and  each of these factors had a positive impact 
secular trends  such as the deployment of technology into work environments and new and emerging work styles  have also positively influenced demand in recent years 
we believe the decline in industry demand experienced in the last two quarters of fiscal was due to economic forecasts of weaker corporate profits 
in late summer and early fall of  many economic analysts began to predict declining corporate profits for the last quarter of calendar and much of additionally  both white collar employment and nonresidential fixed investment were expected to increase at a lower rate than in and this change in the macro economic outlook resulted in many companies delaying or reducing investment plans 
the impact of these changes began to negatively affect our order entry at the beginning of our third quarter 
this was further exacerbated by our normal pattern of lower order entry during the christmas and new year holiday season 
in retrospect  the actual decline in corporate profits was less than expected 
the us economy continued to expand and the international markets began to stabilize 
our industry has historically lagged behind changes in the macro economy by approximately six months 
therefore  we continued to experience weak demand throughout much of our fourth quarter 
as we ended fiscal  demand patterns had begun to firm up 
this was evidenced by a percent increase in order entry  from the third quarter to the fourth quarter 
a portion of the sequential quarter increase was due to the seasonal impact of the holidays 
however  renewed confidence that corporate profits will increase in  coupled with the positive bias in the other macro factors  should enable the industry to return to more normal growth patterns 
bifma is currently estimating that industry shipments will increase to percent in calendar  and to percent in calendar our next fiscal year will contain weeks 
this extra week will be included in our results for the first quarter of fiscal excluding the impact of this event  we expect our sales in the first half of fiscal to be nearly the same as the first half of our sales growth in fiscal is likely to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year  as the year over year comparisons will be more favorable 
in addition  we will still be rebuilding momentum in the first half of the year 
international operations and exports from the united states three years ago  we stated our primary objective for our international business was to improve profitability 
we had experienced several years of net operating losses  failed acquisitions and restructuring charges 
our plan was to right size the business and to retain those assets and operations that were adding value  as a geographic segment  or supporting our multinational customers 
we completed most of this work in fiscal and this included the sale of our german manufacturing operation in  the realignment of our italian operation in  and a turnaround effort in mexico in we are pleased to report that these efforts have all had positive impacts on our profitability with minimal  if any  impact on our sales 
fiscal marked our second year of positive operating results in our international business as a whole 
all of those efforts are now driving tangible results 
in spite of a decline in revenue  net income for was million  versus million last year 
in  we reported a net loss of million  excluding the sale of our german manufacturing operation 
these numbers are different than we have reported in past years 
we have restated all years to conform to our internal reporting  where we allocate the cost of certain corporate functions and assets 
this accounting provides a more accurate picture of the economic returns we receive from these operations 
while we continue to incur losses in some of our operations  no individual location is generating a significant operating loss 
net sales of international operations and export sales from the us for the year declined percent in to million  compared with million last year  and million in the decline in and increases in and were primarily attributable to changes in unit volumes 
graph international net sales in millions of dollars this year  our international sales have been negatively impacted by three macro factors 
first  the strong us dollar has made it more difficult to compete as an exporter 
our production capacity outside of the us is largely limited to the united kingdom 
second  the crisis in asia has led indigenous companies to curtail investments and caused american multinationals to reevaluate the amount of risk they are willing to take in these markets 
last  the economic situation in latin america has slowed activity levels in that region 
the sales decline for the year was primarily attributable to our canadian business and  to a lesser extent  south america 
the decline in canada is due  in part  to the weak canadian dollar 
in addition  our sales in canada are heavily project driven and some project business from last year did not repeat in the current year 
we continue to have very good results in our mexico and united kingdom operations 
each of these regions has increased revenue for each of the past three years 
while our operations on the continent of europe showed a decline in revenue in  we are very pleased with the progress we have made in profitability and capability 
gross margin fiscal marked the third year in a row where we improved our gross margin percentage 
gross margin  as a percent of sales  increased to percent for the year  compared to percent in the prior year  and percent in this improvement contributed approximately million to eva and net income in the current year 
three primary factors are responsible for our improvements in gross margin manufacturing productivity  reductions in material costs  and favorable changes in product mix 
a decline in incentive compensation contributed to the improvement in these incentives are paid to all employees and are tied to year over year improvement in eva 
as discussed above  in  these positive factors were partially offset by increased discounts given to customers 
we began to make significant improvements in our manufacturing processes in at that time  we implemented a series of changes to our manufacturing and logistical operations that eliminated or reduced non value adding activities 
this resulted in the elimination of certain facilities 
those changes continued to pay dividends to us over the past three years 
in addition  we are in the process of implementing lean manufacturing techniques throughout our operations 
these techniques are a process of continuous improvement that focuses on the elimination of waste in all aspects of our business 
while it s difficult to quantify  we believe that this process began to have a significant impact on our costs in if this is true  the good news is that we are in the very early stages of this work and can anticipate an ongoing positive impact on costs 
our improvements in manufacturing productivity have also led to a substantial reduction in the amount of money we have invested in working capital 
at the end of  the day s sales outstanding in the sum of our accounts receivable and inventory had declined to days  compared to days and days at the end of and  respectively 
these improvements are the result of eliminating steps in the physical distribution process  faster cycle times  and improved connectivity with our vendors 
in addition  as our operations become more reliable  our customers pay on a more timely basis 
these improvements have had a significant impact on eva 
over the past three years  these improvements have resulted in a cumulative decrease in capital deployed of million or a million increase in annual eva 
our manufacturing operations rely heavily on our supply base 
in fact  percent of our cost of goods sold is material cost 
we believe this is a competitive advantage 
not only are our costs more variable with sales  we can be more flexible in selecting new materials and processes in the research  design  and development of new products 
however  to be cost competitive and achieve the reliability and speed we demand  we must be connected with our supply base technologically and in purpose 
we are making progress on both fronts 
by partnering with our supply base  we were able to reduce our material cost by approximately million in this work also has had and will continue to have a positive impact on our speed  reliability  and working capital investment 
our product mix has continued to shift toward seating products  a trend that started several years ago 
over the past four years  we introduced several new seating products  which we believe have given us the strongest work seating offering in our industry 
as a result  our sales in this product segment have increased at a faster rate than our total sales 
on average  these products have higher gross margin levels 
while this has had a beneficial impact on margins  office furniture systems still represent the largest industry segment 
we have introduced several new office systems products that we believe will enable us to increase our rate of sales growth in this category 
q system  a product line that was introduced in june of  began to make a significant contribution to our sales in passage desk based system  introduced in june of  became available for order in the third quarter of in june of  we introduced resolve system 
we believe this product line will set new reference points for function  aesthetics  and costs in the systems furniture segment 
each of these products received a gold award on their introduction at the industry s annual trade show  neocon 
over the last few years  we have had relatively stable pricing 
the increased discounting in was not confined to any one product 
discounting in was more pronounced than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year  however  given the slower demand pattern  pricing has remained rational 
for the year  the impact of increased discounting was approximately million  or percent of sales 
at the end of  we began to implement a new enterprise resource planning erp system in most of our us operations 
as part of this implementation  we intend to reengineer many of our operating processes 
we believe the implementation of these investments  coupled with our implementation of lean manufacturing techniques  will improve our quality and reliability and reduce lead times and the cost of producing product 
last year  we estimated the total investment to implement the erp system would be approximately million 
we were wrong 
the project will take longer than we anticipated and we now expect the total cost to be million 
after a difficult start  we reorganized the implementation  recruited several new information technology professionals  and reduced our reliance on external consultants 
while we are not pleased with the increased time and money  we are confident that the revised plan will be achieved and believe this investment will generate positive eva and improve our competitive position 
to date  we have two west michigan manufacturing sites operating on the new system 
we also are using the system for the financial operations of our largest operation in the us all of these areas implemented these systems with very little  if any  disruption 
while it is still early  we are seeing tangible benefits where we had anticipated them 
we expect to implement the new system at the majority of our manufacturing sites over the next to months 
graph gross margin as a percent of net sales going forward  we expect gross margins to remain in the range of to percent of sales 
continued productivity improvements and material cost reductions will be offset  to some degree  by additional discounting 
we also could be negatively impacted by the cost of disruptions associated with implementation of our erp system  a new production facility in atlanta  georgia  and new products that will be introduced over the next months 
operating expenses over the last four years  operating expense reductions have been a key driver of our improvement in eva 
since  we have reduced our operating expenses from percent of sales to percent in this reduction accounts for million of eva on an annual basis 
this year  we had very little change in operating expenses 
the percent reported for is virtually the same as the percent we reported in graph operating expenses as a percent of net sales last year  we told you our goal was to reduce operating expenses to percent by our goal is still percent of sales  but it will take us until to achieve it 
two things prevented us from making progress toward our goal in first  as we discussed above  we did not have a great deal of top line growth 
second  we have been and continue to be in a period of significant investment 
we believe these investments  both capital and expense  are critical to building the capabilities we need to have a sustainable competitive advantage 
three areas required significant incremental spending during the first of these areas is the continued development of our electronic selling platform  referred to internally as the platform 
essentially  using this tool  we are able to design  specify  quote  and place an order  from a laptop personal computer brought to the customer s site 
this tool has significantly improved the buying experience for our customers  while having the added benefit of streamlining the order entry process 
our incremental investment in developing and implementing this capability was million  or percent of net sales in as we have discussed throughout this report  the deployment of technology has been and will continue to be a key focus for us 
to support this work  we have increased the size and expertise of our information technology staff 
this year  the team was focused on implementing our new erp system and upgrading our information technology infrastructure 
in total  our spending in this area increased million 
we expect our information technology costs to remain at an increased level for the foreseeable future 
this is due  in part  to our ongoing erp implementation 
in addition  we believe that most companies who lead their industry also lead in the deployment of technology 
the third area of incremental expenditure was design and research 
design and research costs  excluding royalty payments  were million in  compared to million in  and million in royalty payments made to designers of the company s products as the products are sold are not included in research and development costs  since they are considered to be a variable cost of the product 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs were percent in  percent in  and percent in as discussed earlier  new product design and development has been  and continues to be  a key business strategy 
the increased expenditures are directly related to the increased number of new products introduced and currently in development 
in addition to these areas  we had incremental operating expenses from acquisitions completed during fiscal and  and increases in wages and benefits of approximately percent 
our incremental expenditures were partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments 
our executive incentives and company wide gain sharing programs are based on the annual improvement in eva 
operating income the combination of improved gross margins and relatively unchanged operating expenses has resulted in significant improvements in operating income 
as a percent of sales  operating income improved to percent in  after improving to percent in  and percent in the amount excludes the charge for the sale of our german manufacturing operation 
the percent recorded in was the highest reported for a fiscal year in over years 
graph operating income as a percent of net sales income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in  compared to percent and percent in and  respectively 
the lower tax rate is due primarily to lower state taxes  international tax benefits and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
the tax rate was also negatively impacted by the loss on the sale of the german manufacturing operation  which provided a tax benefit that was lower than our statutory rate 
we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal to be in the range of to percent 
liquidity and capital resources the table below shows certain key cash flow and capital highlights in thousands cash and cash equivalents    cash from operating activities    days sales in accounts receivable and inventory capital expenditures    debt to ebitda ratio 


ebitda to interest expense ratio eva capital    nopat to eva capital our cash flow from operations declined percent in  to million  from the all time high we recorded last year of million 
the decrease from last year was due to an incremental increase in working capital of million 
last year we were able to reduce our dollars invested in working capital by million 
as we discussed above  we continued to do an excellent job of managing our working capital in days sales outstanding in the total of accounts receivable and inventory declined days or percent 
over the past four years  we have reduced our days sales outstanding by days or percent 
as noted above  this has significantly increased our return on invested capital 
our progress in was offset by declines in accounts payable and unfunded checks 
these reductions were the result of lower inventory balances and the timing of payments to vendors 
we believe the investments we are making in the deployment of lean manufacturing techniques and information technology will allow us to achieve further improvements in working capital 
fiscal capital expenditures were primarily for investments in our new erp system  overall information technology infrastructure  the development and deployment of our electronic selling platform  new products  and machinery and equipment to improve operational performance and expand capacity 
at the end of the fiscal year  million of capital was committed for future expenditures 
in  we established a plan to reduce the cash we had invested in nonproductive or nonessential assets 
this has resulted in the sale of certain real estate assets over the past three years 
during  we completed the sale of our manufacturing site and excess land in roswell  georgia  a building in grandville  michigan  and excess land in the united kingdom 
total proceeds from the sale of these properties were million 
our gain on the sale of these assets  net of other capital losses  was million or 
per share 
the grandville site is no longer needed and will not be replaced 
the georgia facility will be replaced by a new facility  which will be completed in the new facility will enable us to consolidate the operations currently performed on our roswell site with operations performed at two leased locations  thus lowering our total operating costs and providing increased capacity 
graph cash flow from operating activities in millions of dollars we expect capital expenditures  net of redeployments  to increase to between million and million in the largest planned expenditures will be investments in our erp system  electronic selling platform  new products  the new facility in georgia  and facility enhancements in west michigan 
in  we acquired three privately owned north american dealers as part of our service strategy 
these local service organizations were acquired for approximately million 
we also invested million to enter into a joint venture with one of our north american dealers 
we expect to invest between million and million in acquiring additional local and regional service operations in at the end of  we continued to have a high level of cash and cash equivalents 
we intend to utilize the cash to repurchase shares of the company s stock  to fund acquisitions  and to fund future capital expenditures 
in the past year  we reexamined our use of the debt to capital ratio as a financial statistic 
our debt to capital ratio at the end of was percent  compared to percent at the end of this was the highest debt to capital ratio we have had in over years  and is due to the large amount of our common stock repurchased over the past four years 
we determined that it is more important for our company to look at the liquidity of the business and its cash generating potential than at historical retained earnings 
we need the financial flexibility to finance our growth and share repurchase plans and to enable us to effectively manage our capital structure 
the covenants on our long term debt and revolving credit loan contained minimum net worth requirements 
in  we renegotiated the covenants and obtained a new million unsecured revolving credit facility 
going forward  our capital structure will be managed based on two tenets 
first  we will maintain the financial strength and flexibility that would enable our debt to be rated investment grade 
second  we will maintain a minimum ebitda to interest expense ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio 
ebitda stands for earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
our available credit  combined with our existing cash and expected cash flow  is adequate to fund our day to day operations  strategic investments  and share repurchases 
if necessary  we also have informal credit facilities that can be accessed 
common stock transactions in thousands  except share and per share data shares acquired    cost of shares acquired    cost per share acquired shares issued    cost per share issued cash dividends    dividends per share 


the board of directors first authorized the company to repurchase its common stock in  and has periodically renewed its authorization 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million under the board approved stock repurchase program 
over the past four years  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for million  adjusted for stock splits in fiscal and this represents approximately percent of the common shares outstanding at the end of management and the board of directors believe the share repurchase program is an excellent means of returning value to our shareholders and preventing dilution from employee ownership programs 
in january of this year  our board of directors approved an additional million to be used for share repurchases 
we currently have million remaining on this authorization 
graph total cash returned to shareholders in millions of dollars graph total return to shareholders as a percent herman miller s p year this year readiness disclosure is the most current information available and replaces all previous disclosures made by the company in its filings on form q and form k  and in its annual report to shareholders 
during fiscal year  the company performed an analysis of the work necessary to assure that its existing information systems and manufacturing equipment for both domestic and international operations will be able to address the issues surrounding the advent of the year company s state of readiness herman miller has a comprehensive  written plan that is regularly updated and monitored by technical personnel and company management  and reported to senior management and the board of directors 
all of our domestic locations are now substantially year compliant 
for international locations  the company presently believes that all remediation and testing will be completed prior to august the company has also verified year conversion plans with its significant vendors and independent dealers 
all significant vendors and independent dealers confirmed that they were year compliant or are in the process of completing their year conversion plans 
costs to address the company s year issues to date  the company has spent approximately million on year renovations 
these are renovations to existing systems and are exclusive of the implementation of our new erp system 
the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the year project  and such costs incurred are principally related to payroll costs for employees involved with the project 
based on costs incurred to date  the company does not believe the expenses related to year compliance will be material to the results of its operations  financial position  or cash flows 
the company does not expect to spend any significant additional amounts to complete the renovation 
risks of the company s year issues the company expects to have completed its year remediation plan prior to any year issues having an adverse impact on its operations 
due to the uncertain and unprecedented nature of the year issue  however  and especially the uncertainty surrounding the readiness of third party vendors  independent dealers  and customers  the company cannot provide assurance at this time that the consequences of the year dating issue will not have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
possible business consequences of the year dating issues include  but are not limited to  higher than expected costs of remediation  or a temporary inability to manufacture or ship product  process transactions  communicate with customers  vendors  subsidiary locations and employees  or conduct other similar corporate activities in a normal business environment 
company s contingency plans in the event that additional actions beyond those described above are necessary  the company will immediately  upon identifying the need  begin developing and implementing remedial actions to address the issues 
contingencies the company  for a number of years  has sold various products to the united states government under general services administration gsa multiple award schedule contracts 
the gsa is permitted to audit the company s compliance with the gsa contracts 
at any point in time  a number of gsa audits are either scheduled or in progress 
management has been notified that the gsa referred an audit of the company to the department of justice for consideration of a potential civil false claims act case

we are not aware of any other litigation or threatened litigation that would have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
conclusion in conclusion  we have shared with you the key elements of our financial performance  including how we intend to increase our market opportunity and improve our operational performance 
each of these elements played a key role in our eva and net income improvement over the past three years and  we believe  will continue to enable us to improve eva and net income and provide superior returns to our shareholders in the future
