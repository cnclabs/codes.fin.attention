outlook the focus of this segment is variable coli  which continues to be a product generally used by employers to fund non qualified benefits or other post employment benefit liabilities 
the leveraged coli product has been an important contributor to hartford life s profitability in recent years and will continue to contribute to the profitability of hartford life in the future  although the level of profit is expected to decline 
coli is subject to a changing legislative and regulatory environment that could have a material adverse affect on its business 
certain proposed legislative initiatives which could impact hartford life are discussed in the regulatory initiatives and contingencies section 
reserves in accordance with applicable insurance regulations under which hartford life operates  life insurance subsidiaries of the company establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves which are calculated to meet hartford life s future obligations 
reserves for life insurance and disability contracts are based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the united states  which are modified to reflect hartford life s actual experience when appropriate 
these reserves are computed at amounts that  with additions from premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates  are expected to be sufficient to meet the company s policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured s death 
reserves include unearned premiums  premium deposits  claims incurred but not reported and claims reported but not yet paid 
reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed on bases essentially comparable to direct insurance reserves 
investments general the company s investments are managed by its investment strategy group  which consists of a risk management unit and a portfolio management unit and reports directly to senior management of the company 
the risk management unit is responsible for monitoring and managing the company s asset liability profile and establishing investment objectives and guidelines 
the portfolio management unit is responsible for determining  within specified risk tolerances and investment guidelines  the appropriate asset allocation  duration  and convexity characteristics of the company s general account and guaranteed separate account investment portfolios 
the hartford investment management company  a wholly owned subsidiary of the hartford financial services group  inc  executes the investment plan of the investment strategy group  including the identification and purchase of securities that fulfill the objectives of the strategy group 
the primary investment objective of the company s general account and guaranteed separate accounts is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of policyholder obligations 
the company does not hold any financial instruments purchased for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to two primary sources of investment risk credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with an obligor s continued ability to make timely payment of principal and or interest  and interest rate risk  relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves 
see the capital markets risk management section for further discussion of the company s approach to managing these investment risks 
the company s separate accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption non guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all the investment risk and reward  and guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and   respectively  wherein hartford life contractually guarantees either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder 
non guaranteed separate account products include variable annuities  variable life insurance contracts and coli 
guaranteed separate account products primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuities and modified guaranteed life insurance and generally include market value adjustment features to mitigate the risk of disintermediation 
the company s general account consists of a diversified portfolio of investments 
although all the assets of the general account support all the company s liabilities  the company s investment strategy group has developed separate investment portfolios for specific classes of product liabilities within the general account 
the strategy group works closely with the business lines to develop specific investment guidelines  including duration targets  asset allocation and convexity constraints  asset liability mismatch tolerances and return objectives for each product line in order to achieve each product line s individual risk and return objectives 
invested assets in the company s general account totaled billion as of december  and were comprised of billion of fixed maturities  billion of policy loans and other investments of as of december   general account invested assets totaled billion and were comprised of billion of fixed maturities  billion of policy loans and other investments of policy loans  which had a weighted average interest rate of and  as of december  and  respectively  increased primarily as a result of the mbl recapture 
these loans are secured by the cash value of the underlying life insurance policies and do not mature in a conventional sense  but expire in conjunction with the related policy liabilities

capital markets risk management as described below  credit risk and market risk are the primary sources of investment risk to the company 
the following discussion identifies the company s policies and procedures for managing these risks and monitoring the results of the company s risk management activities 
credit risk hartford life has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors and counterparties  limit credit concentrations  encourage diversification and require frequent creditworthiness reviews 
investment activity  including setting of policy and defining acceptable risk levels  is subject to regular review and approval by senior management and frequent review by hartford life s finance committee 
the company invests primarily in securities rated investment grade and has established exposure limits  diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including borrower  issuer and counterparty 
creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an internal credit evaluation supplemented by consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness  typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
obligor  asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established limits and monitored at regular intervals 
the following table identifies fixed maturity securities for the company s operations by credit quality 
the ratings referenced in the tables are based on the ratings of nationally recognized rating organizations or  if not rated  assigned based on the company s internal analysis of such securities 
as of december  and  over of the fixed maturity portfolio  including guaranteed separate accounts  was invested in investment grade securities 
fixed maturities by credit quality fair value percent fair value percent us government government agencies   aaa   aa   a   bbb   bb below short term   total fixed maturities   the company also maintains credit policies regarding the financial stability and credit standing of its major derivatives counterparties and typically requires credit enhancement provisions to further reduce its credit risk 
credit risk for derivatives contracts is limited to the amounts calculated to be due to the company on such contracts based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the company and its counterparties 
credit exposures are quantified weekly and netted  and collateral is pledged to or held by the company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds 
market risk hartford life s general and guaranteed separate account exposure to market risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates 
the following discussion focuses on the company s exposure to interest rate risk  asset liability management strategies utilized to manage this risk  and characteristics of the company s insurance liabilities and their sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates can potentially impact the company s profitability 
under certain circumstances of interest rate volatility  the company could be exposed to disintermediation risk and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins 
for non guaranteed separate accounts  the company s exposure is not significant since the policyholder assumes substantially all of the investment risk 
the company s general account and guaranteed separate account investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade  fixed maturity securities  including corporate bonds  asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities 
the fair value of these and the company s other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid 
in addition  during such periods  the company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields 
conversely  during periods of rising interest rates  the rate of prepayments generally declines exposing the company to the possibility of asset liability cash flow and yield mismatch 
for a discussion of the company s risk management techniques to manage this market risk  see asset liability management strategies used to manage market risk below 
as described above  the company holds a significant fixed maturity portfolio  which includes both fixed and variable rate features 
the following table reflects the principal amounts of the fixed and variable rate fixed maturity portfolio  along with the respective weighted average coupons by estimated maturity year as of december  comparative totals are included for december  expected maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions 
the weighted average coupon on variable rate securities is based on spot rates as of december  and  and is primarily based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
callable bonds and notes are distributed to either call dates or maturity  depending on which date produces the most conservative yield 
asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are distributed to maturity year based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
these estimates are developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data 
such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral 
actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates

asset liability management strategies used to manage market risk the company employs several risk management tools to quantify and manage market risk arising from its investments and interest sensitive liabilities 
for certain portfolios  management monitors the changes in present value between assets and liabilities resulting from various interest rate scenarios using integrated asset liability measurement systems and a proprietary system that simulates the impacts of parallel and non parallel yield curve shifts 
based on this current and prospective information  management implements risk reducing techniques to improve the match between assets and liabilities 
derivatives play an important role in facilitating the management of interest rate risk  creating opportunities to efficiently fund obligations  hedge against risks that affect the value of certain liabilities and adjust broad investment risk characteristics as a result of any significant changes in market risks 
the company uses a variety of derivatives  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards and exchange traded financial futures and options  in order to hedge exposure primarily to interest rate risk on anticipated investment purchases or existing assets and liabilities 
the company does not make a market or trade derivatives for the express purpose of earning trading profits 
the company s derivative program is monitored by an internal compliance unit and is reviewed frequently by senior management and reported to hartford life s finance committee 
the notional amounts of derivative contracts  which represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk  totaled billion as of december  billion related to insurance investments and billion related to life insurance liabilities 
as of december   the notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled billion billion related to insurance investments and billion related to life insurance liabilities 
the strategies described below are used to manage the aforementioned risks 
anticipatory hedging for certain liabilities  the company commits to the price of the product prior to receipt of the associated premium or deposit 
anticipatory hedges are routinely executed to offset the impact of changes in asset prices arising from interest rate changes pending the receipt of premium or deposit and the subsequent purchase of an asset 
these hedges involve taking a long position in interest rate futures or entering into an interest rate swap with duration characteristics equivalent to the associated liabilities or anticipated investments 
the notional amount of anticipatory hedges as of december  and was and  respectively 
liability hedging several products obligate the company to credit a return to the contract holder which is indexed to a market rate 
to hedge risks associated with these products  the company typically enters into interest rate swaps to convert the contract rate into a rate that trades in a more liquid and efficient market 
this hedging strategy enables the company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies the operation s asset liability matching policy 
additionally  interest rate swaps are used to convert certain fixed contract rates into floating rates  thereby allowing them to be appropriately matched against floating rate assets 
the notional amount of derivatives used for liability hedges as of december  and was billion and billion  respectively 
asset hedging to meet the various policyholder obligations and to provide cost effective prudent investment risk diversification  the company may combine two or more financial instruments to achieve the investment characteristics of a fixed maturity security or that match an associated liability 
the use of derivative instruments in this regard effectively transfers unwanted investment risks or attributes to others 
the selection of the appropriate derivative instruments depends on the investment risk  the liquidity and efficiency of the market  and the asset and liability characteristics 
the notional amount of asset hedges as of december  and was billion and billion  respectively 
portfolio hedging the company periodically compares the duration and convexity of its portfolios of assets to their corresponding liabilities and enters into portfolio hedges to reduce any difference to desired levels 
portfolio hedges reduce the mismatch between assets and liabilities and offset the potential impact to cash flows caused by changes in interest rates 
the notional amount of portfolio hedges as of december  and was billion and billion  respectively 
the following tables provide information as of december   with comparative totals for december   on derivative instruments used in accordance with the aforementioned hedging strategies

life insurance liability characteristics hartford life s insurance liabilities  other than non guaranteed separate accounts  are primarily related to accumulation vehicles such as fixed or variable annuities and investment contracts and other insurance products such as long term disability and term life insurance 
asset accumulation vehicles while interest rate risk associated with these insurance products has been reduced through the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  the primary risk associated with these products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns 
fixed rate products in this category require the company to pay a fixed rate for a certain period of time 
the cash flows are not interest sensitive because the products are written with a market value adjustment feature and the liabilities have protection against the early withdrawal of funds through surrender charges 
product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment and fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts 
contract duration is dependent on the policyholder s choice of guarantee period 
indexed products in this category are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles but require the company to pay a rate that is determined by an external index 
the amount and or timing of cash flows will therefore vary based on the level of the particular index 
the primary risks inherent in these products are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles  with an additional risk that changes in the index may adversely affect profitability 
product examples include indexed guaranteed investment contracts with an estimated duration of up to two years 
interest credited products in this category credit interest to policyholders  subject to market conditions and minimum guarantees 
policyholders may surrender at book value but are subject to surrender charges for an initial period 
product examples include universal life contracts and the general account portion of the company s variable annuity products 
liability duration is short to intermediate term 
other insurance products long term pay out liabilities products in this category are long term in nature and may contain significant actuarial including mortality and morbidity pricing and cash flow risks 
the cash flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments 
the primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and or that the actual timing of the cash flows will differ from those anticipated resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing 
product examples include structured settlement contracts  on benefit annuities ie  the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon and long term disability contracts 
contract duration is generally to years 
short term pay out liabilities these liabilities are short term in nature with a duration of less than one year 
the primary risks associated with these products are determined by the non investment contingencies such as mortality or morbidity and the variability in the timing of the expected cash flows 
liquidity is of greater concern than for the long term pay out liabilities 
products include individual and group term life insurance contracts and short term disability contracts 
management of the duration of investments with respective policyholder obligations is an explicit objective of the company s management strategy 
the estimated cash flows of insurance policy liabilities based upon internal actuarial assumptions as of december  are reflected in the table below by expected maturity year 
comparative totals are included for december  dollars in billions description thereafter total total fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles weighted average credited rate indexed asset accumulation vehicles weighted average credited rate interest credited asset accumulation vehicles weighted average credited rate long term pay out liabilities short term pay out liabilities as of december  and  the fair value of the company s investment contracts  including guaranteed separate accounts  was billion and billion  respectively 
currency exchange risk hartford life s international holdings as of december  totaled approximately  which are primarily located in latin america and are inherently affected by currency fluctuations 
the company s primary currency exposure relates to the brazilian real and the argentine peso and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s liquidity or financial condition 
sensitivity to changes in interest rates for liabilities whose cash flows are not substantially affected by changes in interest rates fixed liabilities and where investment experience is substantially absorbed by the company  the sensitivity of the net economic value discounted present value of asset cash flows less the discounted present value of liability cash flows of those portfolios to basis point shifts in interest rates is shown in the table below 
these fixed liabilities represent approximately of the company s general and guaranteed separate account liabilities at both december  and the remaining liabilities generally allow the company significant flexibility to adjust credited rates to reflect actual investment experience and thereby pass through a substantial portion of actual investment experience to the policyholder 
the fixed liability portfolios are managed and monitored relative to defined objectives and are analyzed regularly by management for internal risk management purposes using scenario simulation techniques  and evaluated annually consistent with regulatory requirements

dividend decisions will be based on  and affected by  a number of factors  including the operating results and financial requirements of hartford life on a stand alone basis and the impact of the regulatory restrictions discussed in liquidity requirements below 
as a holding company  hartford life  inc has no significant business operations of its own and  therefore  primarily relies on the dividends from its insurance company subsidiaries  which are primarily domiciled in connecticut  as the principal source of cash to meet its obligations primarily debt obligations and pay stockholder dividends

there can be no assurance that the company s ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
in the event that the company s ratings are downgraded  the level of sales or the persistency of the company s block of in force business may be adversely impacted 
liquidity requirements the liquidity requirements of hartford life have been and will continue to be met by funds from operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper  debt securities and bank borrowings 
the principal sources of funds are premiums and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets 
hartford life is a holding company which receives operating cash flow in the form of dividends from its subsidiaries  enabling it to service its debt 
dividends to hartford life  inc from its subsidiaries are subject to restriction 
the payment of dividends by connecticut domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of connecticut 
hartford life and accident hla  a direct subsidiary of the company  adheres to these laws  which require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend  which together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of i of the insurer s policyholder surplus as of december of the preceding year or ii net income or net gain from operations  if such company is a life insurance company for the twelve month period ending on the thirty first day of december last preceding  in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting policies 
in addition  if any dividend of a connecticut domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer s earned surplus  it requires the prior approval of the connecticut insurance commissioner 
the total amount of statutory dividends which may be paid by the insurance subsidiaries of the company without prior approval in is estimated to be the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which hartford life s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated or deemed commercially domiciled generally contain similar although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive limitations on the payment of dividends 
the primary uses of funds are to pay claims  policy benefits  operating expenses and commissions  and to purchase new investments 
in addition  hartford life carries a significant short term investment position and accordingly does not anticipate selling intermediate and long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs 
for a discussion of the company s investment objectives and strategies  see the investments section 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted regulations establishing minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital rbc formulas for life insurance companies effective december  
the requirements consist of formulas which identify companies that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions 
the rbc formula for life insurance companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
the rbc ratios for each of the major life insurance subsidiaries are in excess of as of december  cash flow cash provided by operating activities  cash provided by used for investing activities cash used for financing activities cash end of year in  the change in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of timing in the settlement of receivables and payables as well as an increase in income taxes paid 
the change in cash provided by or used for investing activities primarily reflects a decrease in policy loans resulting from the reduction of coli account values in conjunction with the decline of the block of leveraged coli offset by the investment of cash from operating and financing activities 
the change in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to declines in gic and coli account values as well as proceeds from the ipo in may  partially offset by changes in debt  dividends paid and proceeds from the trups offering 
during  cash provided by operating activities increased from the prior year due primarily to growth in the individual life segment and the employee benefits segment 
the change in cash used for investing activities primarily reflects the investment of cash from operating activities 
the change in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to declines in investment type contracts and changes in debt and dividends paid to the company s parent  which were partially offset by proceeds from the ipo 
operating cash flows in the periods presented have been more than adequate to meet liquidity requirements 
purchases of affiliates and other planco on august   the company completed the purchase of all outstanding shares of planco financial services  inc and its affiliate  planco  incorporated collectively  planco 
planco  a primary distributor of the company s annuities and mutual funds  is the nation s largest wholesaler of individual annuities and has played a significant role in hartford life s growth over the past decade 
as a wholesaler  planco distributes hartford life s fixed and variable annuities  mutual funds and single premium variable life insurance  as well as providing sales support to registered representatives  financial planners and broker dealers at brokerage firms and banks across the united states 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the results of planco s operations have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the transaction 
mbl recapture on november   the company recaptured an in force block of coli business referred to as mbl recapture previously ceded to mbl life assurance co 
of new jersey mbl life  as well as purchased the outstanding interest in international corporate marketing group  inc icmg  which was previously owned by mbl life 
the transaction was consummated through the assignment of a reinsurance arrangement between hartford life and mbl life to a hartford life subsidiary 
hartford life originally assumed the life insurance block in from mutual benefit life  which was placed in court supervised rehabilitation in  and reinsured a portion of those polices back to mbl life 
mbl life  previously a mutual benefit life subsidiary  operates under the rehabilitation plan for mutual benefit life 
the mbl recapture has been recorded retroactive to january  with respect to results of operations 
the transaction resulted in a decrease in reinsurance recoverables of billion with an offset primarily in policy loans and other investments 
regulatory initiatives and contingencies legislative initiatives although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often have an impact on the insurance industry in a variety of ways 
current and proposed federal measures which may significantly affect the life insurance business include tax law changes affecting the tax treatment of life insurance products and its impact on the relative desirability of various personal investment vehicles  medical testing for insurability  and proposed legislation to prohibit the use of gender in determining insurance and pension rates and benefits 
in particular  president clinton s federal budget proposal currently contains certain recommendations for modifying tax rules related to the treatment of coli by contractholders which  if enacted as described  could have a material adverse impact on the company s sales of these products 
the budget proposal also includes provisions which would result in a significant increase in the dac tax on certain of the company s products and would apply a tax to the company s policyholder surplus account 
for further discussion on policyholder surplus accounts and related tax treatment as of december   see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is too early to determine whether these tax proposals will ultimately be enacted by congress 
therefore  the potential impact to the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
insolvency fund see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
naic proposals the naic has been developing several model laws and regulations  including a model investment law and amendments to the model holding company system regulatory act the holding act amendments 
the model investment law defines the investments which are permissible for life insurers to hold  and the holding act amendments address the types of activities in which subsidiaries and affiliates may engage 
the naic adopted these models in and  but the laws have not been enacted for insurance companies domiciled in the state of connecticut  such as hartford life 
even if enacted in connecticut or other states in which hartford life s subsidiaries are domiciled  it is expected that these laws will neither significantly change hartford life s investment strategies nor have any material adverse effect on hartford life s liquidity or financial position 
the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles sap in march the proposed effective date for the statutory accounting guidance is january  it is expected that hartford life s domiciliary state will adopt the sap and the company will make the necessary changes required for implementation 
these changes are not anticipated to have a material impact on the statutory financial statements of hartford life 
dependence on certain third party relationships hartford life distributes its annuity and life insurance products through a variety of distribution channels  including broker dealers  banks  wholesalers  its own internal sales force and other third party marketing organizations 
the company periodically negotiates provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to the company or such service providers 
an interruption in the company s continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect the company s ability to market its products 
year in general the year issue relates to the ability or inability of computer hardware  software and other information technology it systems  as well as non it systems  such as equipment and machinery with imbedded chips and microprocessors  to properly process information and data containing or related to dates beginning with the year and beyond 
the year issue exists because  historically  many it and non it systems that are in use today were developed years ago when a year was identified using a two digit date field rather than a four digit date field 
as information and data containing or related to the century date are introduced to date sensitive systems  these systems may recognize the year as  or not at all  which may result in systems processing information incorrectly 
this  in turn  may significantly and adversely affect the integrity and reliability of information databases of it systems  may cause the malfunctioning of certain non it systems  and may result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to a company 
in addition  year problems that occur with third parties with which a company does business  such as suppliers  computer vendors  distributors and others  may also adversely affect any given company 
the integrity and reliability of hartford life s it systems  as well as the reliability of its non it systems  are integral aspects of hartford life s business 
hartford life issues insurance policies  annuities  mutual funds and other financial products to individual and business customers  nearly all of which contain date sensitive data  such as policy expiration dates  birth dates and premium payment dates 
in addition  various it systems support communications and other systems that integrate hartford life s various business segments and field offices  including hartford life s foreign operations 
hartford life also has business relationships with numerous third parties that affect virtually all aspects of hartford life s business  including  without limitation  suppliers  computer hardware and software vendors  insurance agents and brokers  securities broker dealers and other distributors of financial products  many of which provide date sensitive data to hartford life  and whose operations are important to hartford life s business 
internal year efforts and timetable beginning in  hartford life began working on making its it systems year ready  either through installing new programs or replacing systems 
since january  hartford life s year efforts have focused on the remaining year issues related to it and non it systems in all of hartford life s business segments 
these year efforts include the following five main initiatives identifying and assessing year issues  taking actions to remediate it and non it systems so that they are year ready  testing it and non it systems for year readiness  deploying such remediated and tested systems back into their respective production environments  and conducting internal and external integrated testing of such systems 
as of december   hartford life substantially completed initiatives through of its internal year efforts 
hartford life has begun initiative and management currently anticipates that such activity will continue into the fourth quarter of third party year efforts and timetable hartford life s year efforts include assessing the potential impact on hartford life of third parties year readiness 
hartford life s third party year efforts include the following three main initiatives identifying third parties which have significant business relationships with hartford life  including  without limitation  insurance agents  brokers  third party administrators  banks and other distributors and servicers of financial products  and inquiring of such third parties regarding their year readiness  evaluating such third parties responses to hartford life s inquiries  and based on the evaluation of third party responses or a third party s failure to respond and the significance of the business relationship  conducting additional activities with respect to third parties as determined to be necessary in each case 
these activities may include conducting additional inquiries  more in depth evaluations of year readiness and plans  and integrated it systems testing 
hartford life has completed the first third party initiative and  as of early  had substantially completed evaluating third party responses received 
hartford life has begun conducting the additional activities described in initiative and management currently anticipates that it will continue to do so through the end of however  notwithstanding these third party year efforts  hartford life does not have control over these third parties and  as a result  hartford life cannot currently determine to what extent future operating results may be adversely affected by the failure of these third parties to adequately address their year issues 
year costs the costs of hartford life s year program that were incurred through the year ended december  were not material to hartford life s financial condition or results of operations 
the after tax costs of hartford life s year efforts for the year ended december  were approximately management currently estimates that after tax costs related to the year program to be incurred in will be less than these costs are being expensed as incurred 
risks and contingency plans if significant year problems arise  including problems arising with third parties  failures of it and non it systems could occur  which in turn could result in substantial interruptions in hartford life s business 
in addition  hartford life s investing activities are an important aspect of its business and hartford life may be exposed to the risk that issuers of investments held by it will be adversely impacted by year issues 
given the uncertain nature of year problems that may arise  especially those related to the readiness of third parties discussed above  management cannot determine at this time whether the consequences of year related problems that could arise will have a material impact on hartford life s financial condition or results of operations 
hartford life is in the process of developing certain contingency plans so that if  despite its year efforts  year problems ultimately arise  the impact of such problems may be avoided or minimized 
these contingency plans are being developed based on  among other things  known or reasonably anticipated circumstances and potential vulnerabilities 
the contingency planning also includes assessing the dependency of hartford life s business on third parties and their year readiness 
hartford life currently anticipates that internal and external contingency plans will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of however  in many contexts  year issues are dynamic  and ongoing assessments of business functions  vulnerabilities and risks must be made 
as such  new contingency plans may be needed in the future and or existing plans may need to be modified as circumstances warrant 
effect of inflation the rate of inflation as measured by the change in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenues or operating results of hartford life during the three most recent fiscal years
