item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the statements included below and in other portions of this report  including those regarding future financial performance or results or that are not historical facts  are or contain forward looking information as that term is defined in the securities act of  as amended 
the words expect  believe  anticipate  project  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the company cautions readers that any such statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and such statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include  but are not limited to  dependence on the oil and gas industry and industry conditions  general economic conditions including interest rates and inflation  competition  the ability of the company to continue its acquisition strategy  successfully manage its growth  and obtain funds to finance its growth  operating risks  contract bidding risks  the use of estimates for revenue recognition  risks of international operations  risks of vessel construction such as cost overruns  changes in government regulations  and disputes with construction contractors  dependence on key personnel and the availability of skilled workers during periods of strong demand  the impact of regulatory and environmental laws  the ability to obtain insurance  and other factors discussed below 
operating risks include hazards such as vessel capsizing  sinking  grounding  colliding  and sustaining damage in severe whether conditions 
these hazards can also cause personal injury  loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution and environmental damage  and suspension of operations 
the risks inherent with international operations include political  social  and economic instability  exchange rate fluctuations  currency restrictions  nullification  modification  or renegotiations of contracts  potential vessel seizure  nationalization of assets  import export quotas  and other forms of public and governmental regulation 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
as a result of the company s expansion into international areas over the last five years and the timing of oil companies capital expenditures in those areas  revenues generated from each of the company s international areas increased during the nine months ended december  compared to the same period of the prior year 
however  as a result of the prolonged worldwide oil price weakness that began in mid  the company began experiencing an overall decline in the demand for its services and increased competition during the nine months ended december   as oil and gas companies began cutting back their capital expenditures 
increased competition for available projects  which resulted from the lower oil price conditions  the greater contribution from international operations  which have historically had lower margins  and increased interest expense as a result of the company s higher debt levels resulted in overall lower net income in the same period 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues 
nine months ended year ended december  march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit equity in net earnings loss of unconsolidated affiliate selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense other income  net income before income taxes provision for income net income the company s results of operations reflect the level of offshore construction activity in the gulf of mexico and west africa  for all periods presented above  and the company s expansion through acquisitions in asia pacific and latin america in december in addition  the company s results for periods ending after july include the results of additional business acquired in july from subsea international  inc in the gulf of mexico  asia pacific  and the middle east 
the results also reflect the company s ability to win jobs through competitive bidding and manage awarded jobs to successful completion 
the level of offshore construction activity is principally determined by three factors first  the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves on production  second  the oil and gas industry s need to clear all structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and third  weather events such as major hurricanes 
nine months ended december  compared to nine months ended december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report revenues 
revenues for the nine months ended december  of million were higher than revenues for the nine months ended december  of million 
the increase in revenues resulted largely from increased international activity and the company s expansion in those areas  through acquisitions 
recent acquisitions that contributed to increased international revenues included i certain business operations and assets of sub sea international  inc in the gulf of mexico  asia pacific  and the middle east in july  ii the construction barge seminole acquired in june  and iii the construction barges dlb and dlb acquired in april the west africa region produced greater revenues during the nine months ended december  compared to the same period a year earlier as offshore construction projects resumed after a cycle of low construction activity in the earlier period 
the overall increase in revenues was partially offset by decreased revenues from operations in the gulf of mexico 
gross profit 
for the nine months ended december   the company had gross profit of million compared with million for the nine months ended december  the increase was largely the result of increased west africa and asia pacific activity  and was partially offset by lower gross profit from the gulf of mexico 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the nine months ended december   was compared to the gross profit percentage earned for the nine months ended december  of 
lower margins in the gulf of mexico  combined with the lower margins for work in asia pacific and middle east  contributed to the decline 
margins as a percent of revenue in west africa for the nine months ended december   were higher than the nine months ended december  cost of revenues for the nine months ended december  includes an accrual of million for retirement and incentive compensation expense 
the company did not record a provision for retirement and incentive compensation during the nine months ended december  selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for the nine months ended december   selling  general  and administrative expenses of million were higher than the million reported during the nine months ended december  the increase was attributable to the expansion of the company s business and accrued severance costs and was partially offset by salary reductions effected in october as a percentage of revenues they remained at approximately 
during the nine months ended december   the company provided for million of retirement and incentive compensation plan expenses with million included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the company did not record a provision for retirement and incentive compensation during the nine months ended december  because it does not anticipate making such payments to employees for services during that period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of drydocking costs  for the nine months ended december  was million compared to the million recorded in the nine months ended december  the increase was principally attributable to increased employment of the upgraded hercules in the gulf of mexico and employment of the seminole  dlb  and dlb in asia pacific  each of which are depreciated on a units of production basis 
a full nine months of depreciation on assets acquired from subsea in july and higher amounts of drydock amortization also contributed to the increase 
lower employment of other vessels that are also depreciated on a units of production basis partially offset the increase 
effective april   the company changed its estimate of the useful lives of certain marine barges that are depreciated on the units of production method 
the company increased total estimated operating days for such barges to better reflect the estimated periods during which the assets will remain in service 
for the nine months ended december   the change had the effect of reducing depreciation expense by million and increasing net income by million per basic and diluted share 
interest expense 
interest expense was million net of capitalized interest for the nine months ended december   compared to million for the nine months ended december  principally due to higher average long term debt outstanding 
net income 
net income for the nine months ended december  declined to million as compared to million recorded for the nine months ended december  included in net income for the nine months ended december  is a million loss associated with the company s ownership interest in ccc 
the loss associated with the ccc ownership for the nine months ended december  was million 
increased operating losses  currency exchange rate losses  and an adjustment to prior years taxes contributed in the increase in ccc s losses 
the company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended december  was  compared to for the nine months ended december   reflecting changes in taxable income in differing taxable jurisdictions 
segment information 
the company has identified six reportable segments as required by sfas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discusses the results of operations for each of those reportable segments 
gulf of mexico offshore construction overall decreased demand for offshore construction services in the gulf of mexico and resulting pricing decreases caused this segment s gross revenues to decline to million including million intersegment revenues for the nine months ended december  compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the nine months ended december  the lower activity levels also caused profits before taxes to decline to million during the nine months ended december  compared to million for the nine months ended december  the hercules returned to service in july  and helped partially offset the decline 
gulf of mexico diving revenues and profits before taxes from diving related services in the gulf of mexico declined due to decreased demand from the gulf of mexico offshore construction segment 
gross revenues for the nine months ended december  declined to million including million intersegment revenues compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the same period ended december  revenue from external customers increased by million  but was partially offset by pricing decreases 
the overall lower activity levels caused profits before taxes to decline to million during the nine months ended december  compared to million for the nine months ended december  gulf of mexico marine support decreased demand and resulting pricing decreases also affected the gulf of mexico marine support services 
gross revenues from gulf of mexico marine support services declined to million including million intersegment revenues for the nine months ended december   compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the same period ended december  profits before taxes also declined to million during the nine months ended december  compared to million for the nine months ended december  the overall declines were partially offset by increased activity and resulting gross revenues and profits from the swath pioneer 
west africa construction during  the west africa construction market recovered from a down cycle in for the nine months ended december   gross revenues increased to million including million intersegment revenues compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the nine months ended december  profits before taxes increased to million during the nine months ended december  compared to a million loss for the nine months ended december  for the first time since entering the west africa market  the company employed two barges simultaneously during the nine months ended december asia pacific construction asia pacific construction results benefited from the acquisition and placement of construction barges in that region 
for the nine months ended december   gross revenues increased to million compared to million for the nine months ended december  the asia pacific segment did not generate any intersegment revenues 
profits before taxes increased to million during the nine months ended december  compared to a million loss for the nine months ended december  in april  the company acquired the dlb and dlb in that region 
each of the acquired barges were employed under a short term bare boat charter agreement with hydro marine services  inc  an affiliate of j 
ray mcdermott sa  to allow for completion of certain contractual commitments 
the dlb completed its commitment in august  and the dlb completed its commitment in october in september  the seminole began working in asia pacific after the company relocated it from the middle east 
latin america construction for the nine months ended december   revenue from services and equipment provided to ccc increased to million compared to million for the nine months ended december  the increase was attributable to ccc s increase in offshore construction activity 
profits before taxes and equity in ccc losses increased to million during the nine months ended december  compared to million for the nine months ended december  however  both profit amounts were offset by equity in ccc losses of million and million  respectively 
the increase in ccc s loss was largely the result of increased operating losses  currency exchange rate losses  and an adjustment to prior years taxes 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues 
revenues for the year ended march  of million were higher than year ended march  revenues of million 
the increase in revenues largely resulted from stronger domestic activity and pricing and the company s expansion through acquisitions  and was partially offset by lower revenues from west africa 
recent acquisitions that contributed to increased fiscal revenues included i norman offshore pipelines  inc in june  ii the assets and business of divcon in asia pacific in december  iii two large combination pipelay and derrick barges from j 
ray mcdermott  s 
a 
in december  and iv certain business operations and assets of sub sea international  inc in the gulf of mexico  asia pacific  and the middle east in july gross profit 
for the year ended march   the company had gross profit of million compared with million for the year ended march  the increase was largely the result of increased domestic activity and higher pricing and the company s expansion through acquisitions  and was partially offset by lower gross profit from west africa 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues in the year ended march  was compared to the gross profit percentage earned during the year ended march  of 
higher year ended march  margins in the gulf of mexico were partially offset by lower gross profit margins earned in asia pacific and the middle east 
cost of revenues for the year ended march  includes an accrual of million for retirement and incentive compensation expense  as compared to a provision of million a year earlier 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
while selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended march  of million were higher than the million reported in the year ended march   as a percentage of revenues they decreased to approximately from approximately 
the increase was primarily due to the company s business expansion including expansion to the asia pacific and middle east regions 
the year ended march  expense provision for retirement and incentive compensation plan was million  of which million was included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
in the prior year  the company provided for million of such expenses with million included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of drydocking costs  for the year ended march  was million compared to the million recorded in the year ended march  the increase was principally attributable to increased employment of the company s larger construction barges depreciated on a units of production basis and increases in the company s fleet through construction  upgrades  and acquisitions  and was partially offset by lower employment of the cheyenne and the hercules both depreciated on a units of production basis 
interest expense 
interest expense was million net of capitalized interest in the year ended march  compared to million in the year ended march  principally due to higher average long term debt 
net income 
net income for the year ended march  of million was higher than the million recorded for the year ended march  included in net income for the year ended march  is a million loss associated with the company s ownership interest in ccc 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended march  was  compared to for the year ended march   reflecting lower profits from low tax international areas  and thus  a higher effective tax rate 
segment information 
the company has identified six reportable segments as required by sfas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discusses the results of operations for each of those reportable segments 
gulf of mexico offshore construction overall increased demand for offshore construction services in the gulf of mexico and resulting increased margins helped this segment s gross revenues to increase to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended march  compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended march  the higher activity levels also helped profits before taxes to increase to million during the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the segment also benefited from the july acquisition of certain subsea international inc gulf of mexico assets and the june acquisition of norman offshore pipelines  inc the increase in revenues was partially offset by lower revenues and profits from the hercules  which did not work most of the year because of its construction to upgrade the vessel to a dynamically positioned and pipelay vessel 
gulf of mexico diving revenues and profits before taxes from diving related services in the gulf of mexico also increased due to increased demand and resulting increased margins 
gross revenues for the year ended march  increased to million including million intersegment revenues compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended march  the increased activity levels also caused profits before taxes to increase to million during the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  this segment also benefited from the acquisition of certain subsea international inc gulf of mexico assets in july gulf of mexico marine support increased demand and resulting pricing increases also benefited the gulf of mexico marine support services 
gross revenues from gulf of mexico marine support services increased to million including million intersegment revenues for year ended march   compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended march  profits before taxes also increased to million during the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the overall increase in revenues was also aided by increased activity by the swath pioneer 
however  the pioneer did not contribute any significant profits 
west africa construction the west africa construction market experienced a down cycle in calendar year for the year ended march   gross revenues for this segment decreased to million including million intersegment revenues compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended march  profits before taxes decreased to million during the year ended march  compared to million year ended march asia pacific construction asia pacific construction results benefited from the acquisitions of certain divcon ltd 
pty assets in december  and certain subsea international  inc assets in july for the year ended march   gross revenues increased to million compared to million for the year ended march  the asia pacific segment did not generate any intersegment revenues 
profits before taxes increased slightly to million during the year ended march  compared to a million loss year ended march  latin america construction for the year ended march   revenue from services and equipment provided to ccc increased to million compared to million for the year ended march  revenues included in the year ended march  occurred after the december equity investment in ccc 
profits before taxes and equity in ccc losses increased to million during the year ended march  compared to a negligible loss year ended march  however  the profit for the year ended march  was offset by equity in ccc loss of million 
the company did not record an equity gain or loss during the year ended march  liquidity and capital resources the company s operations generated cash flow of million during the nine months ended december  cash from operations  together with million provided by financing activities  funded investing activities of million 
investing activities consisted principally of i capital expenditures  ii net receipts on advances to ccc  iii dry docking costs  and iv the release from escrow of lake charles harbor and terminal district port improvement revenue bonds proceeds 
funds provided by financing activities principally represent net borrowings under the company s credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks partially offset by purchases of the company s common stock 
working capital increased million during the nine months ended december  from million at march  to million at december  capital expenditures during the nine months ended december  aggregated million 
these expenditures included a million final payment to acquire the dlb and dlb  million for continued conversion and upgrade of the hercules  million for continued construction of the carlyss  louisiana  deepwater support facility and pipebase  and million for the construction of a shorebase facility in batam  indonesia 
also during the nine months ended december   the company settled the previously disclosed arbitration with a shipyard relating to the construction contract terms for the conversion and upgrade of the hercules 
the company included the settlement costs in the conversion and upgrade cost with no current charge to earnings 
the additional cost will not have a significant impact on future results 
the company estimates that the cost to complete capital expenditure projects in progress at december   will be approximately million all of which is expected to be incurred during the year ending december  the scheduled completion of the addition of reel pipelay capability to the hercules is during the fourth quarter of the year ending december  the estimated remaining costs to complete the hercules upgrades are approximately million  which is in addition to the approximately million incurred through december  the company is constructing a deepwater support facility and pipebase near carlyss  louisiana 
the company plans to replace its existing facilities in houma and amelia  louisiana with the carlyss facility 
estimated completion is in the third quarter of the year ending december  at a cost of approximately million  including approximately million including land purchased in december incurred through december  tax exempt revenue bonds issued by the lake charles harbor and terminal district financed approximately million of the construction 
the bonds bear interest at a variable rate  which was at december   and mature on november  in the normal course of business  the company is in the initial phase of replacing its accounting and procurement systems and has established a target date in the fourth quarter for its installations at all locations 
while the company s growth is driving the company s efforts to replace its accounting and procurement systems  the company does expect the implementation of the new accounting and procurement system to mitigate any potential year issues related to the existing accounting and procurement systems 
the company expects the corporate wide accounting and procurement system replacement to cost approximately million 
in august  the board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to purchase shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
the board of directors placed no limit on the duration of the program 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares since the authorization at a total cost of million 
long term debt outstanding at december   including current maturities  includes million of title xi bonds  the million of lake charles harbor and terminal district bonds  and million drawn against the company s revolving line of credit 
the company s title xi bonds mature in    and the bonds carry interest rates of   and per annum  respectively  and require aggregate semi annual payments of million  plus interest 
the agreements pursuant to which the title xi bonds were issued contain certain covenants  including the maintenance of minimum working capital and net worth requirements 
if not met  additional covenants result that restrict the operations of the company and its ability to pay cash dividends 
the company is currently in compliance with these covenants 
the company maintains a revolving line of credit under a loan agreement restated credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks 
effective september   an amendment to the restated credit agreement increased the line of credit from million to million 
the revolving credit facility reduces to million on july   and to million on july  borrowings under the facility bear interest at fluctuating rates  are payable on june   and have subsidiary guarantees and stock pledges as collateral 
the amount of available credit decreases by i borrowings outstanding million at december   ii outstanding letters of credit issued under the restated credit agreement million at december   and iii amounts outstanding under a separate credit agreement between the banks and ccc million at december  
effective march   an additional amendment to the restated credit agreement  among other things  removed the above provision that reduced the amount available by amounts outstanding under a separate credit agreement between the banks and ccc 
for continuing access to the revolving line of credit  the company must remain in compliance with the covenants of the restated credit agreement  including covenants relating to the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
the company also has short term credit facilities at its foreign locations that aggregate million and are secured by parent company guarantees 
additionally  in the normal course of business  the company provides guarantees and performance  bid  and payment bonds pursuant to agreements or obtaining such agreements to perform construction services 
some of these guarantees are secured by parent guarantees 
the aggregate of these guarantees and bonds at december  was million 
the company has guaranteed certain indebtedness and commitments of ccc approximating million at december  million at march  
in april  the company gave a contingent guarantee to a financial institution whereby the guarantee becomes effective if certain vessel contracts of ccc are canceled or not renewed 
the principal amount subject to the contingent guaranty at december  was million 
the company has also given performance and currency guarantees to banks for ccc debt totaling million at december   related to project financings 
under the terms of the performance and currency guarantees  the banks may enforce the guarantees i if the customer does not pay ccc because neither ccc nor the guarantors performed the contracts that define the projects or ii if  after converting contract payments from mexican pesos to united states dollars  funds from the project are insufficient to pay the sums due 
in february  global reached agreement in principal with its partner to restructure its joint venture in mexico  ccc fabricaciones y construcciones  sa de sa ccc 
the agreement replaced all prior pending restructuring agreements 
under the restructuring agreement  its partner  through the assumption of ccc debt  will contribute additional capital of approximately million to ccc 
global  through the forgiveness of advances and receivables due from ccc  will contribute additional capital of approximately million to ccc 
among other provisions  ccc will also dispose of its industrial construction division and subject to due diligence  enter into a fabrication contract that will be contributed by an affiliate of its partner 
the company expects to complete the restructuring in the near future 
after the restructuring  ccc s primary business will be offshore marine construction and marine fabrication 
global has a ownership interest in ccc and charters vessels and other equipment to ccc 
the company expects funds available under the restated credit agreement  proceeds from the tax exempt revenue bonds issued by the lake charles harbor and terminal district  available cash  and cash generated from operations to be sufficient to fund the company s operations  scheduled debt retirement  and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
in the normal course of business  the company is currently evaluating its debt structure and considering alternatives to refinance a portion of its credit facility debt to extend the payment terms beyond the current expiration 
facilities relocation the company is constructing a deepwater support facility and pipebase near carlyss  louisiana  to accommodate deeper draft vessels such as the hercules and the pioneer 
to gain anticipated efficiencies  the company plans to replace the existing facilities in houma and amelia  louisiana with the carlyss facility 
certain of the company s administrative functions will also relocate from its lafayette  louisiana and houston  texas offices 
as a result of the relocation  the company expects to incur certain employment costs  equipment and material relocation costs  and costs to close the replaced facilities 
certain of these anticipated costs were included in the results for the nine months ended december  the company expects the remainder of these costs to be included in the results for the year ending december  the results for the nine months ended december   include the following charges in thousands employee severance pay and transition bonuses asset write down total charge related to facilities relocation  employee severance pay and transition bonuses are amounts payable to certain employees that will not relocate to the new facilities 
the severance pay is payable upon the employees termination by the company 
the transition bonuses are payable to those employees that remain with the company to assist in the continuation of operations and administration  train new employees  and wind down functions at the replaced facilities 
the transition bonuses are payable upon the earlier of termination by the company or the passage of certain time periods while still employed 
none of the employee severance pay and transition bonuses were paid in the nine months ended december  the company expects to pay all such amounts in the year ending december  the asset write down included in the results for the nine months ended december   relates to the estimated impairment in value of certain facilities at the houma  louisiana  location attributable to the relocation from there 
the total employment costs  equipment and material relocation costs  and costs to close the replaced facilities  including those described above  expended during the nine months ended december   and expected to be expended are as follows nine months year ended ending december  december  totals employee severance pay and transition bonuses employee relocation assistance   equipment and material relocation   closing of replaced facilitie total cash expenditures   asset write down total costs related to facilities relocation   in addition to the above estimated costs  the company has issued options for  shares of common stock to certain employees who will relocate 
the options are exercisable over a five year vesting period subject to the employees relocation to the new facility 
as a result  million unearned stock compensation will be amortized over the vesting period 
although the company expects to benefit from the consolidation of its houma  amelia  and lafayette  louisiana  facilities  it cannot reasonably estimate any potential cost savings 
industry outlook given the current industry outlook in the lower oil price environment  the company expects that its trends of increasing revenues will be difficult to maintain in the next fiscal year and for as long as oil and gas companies maintain their curb on capital expenditures 
the company anticipates the impact will be greater on margins and profits as it adjusts its pricing to bid competitively for available projects and as the proportion of lower margin international work to gulf of mexico work becomes greater 
thus  if this situation continues  the company s results of operations for the next fiscal year could be materially lower than the results of the last twelve months 
the company believes that the financial results of its gulf of mexico  asia pacific  and middle east segments will be most affected by industry conditions 
ultimately  the company feels that the industry will bounce back from the current economic environment because eventual economic recovery of developing nations  which will spur demand growth  and depletion of petroleum reserves currently in production will result in more favorable prices for petroleum resources 
favorable prices for petroleum resources will result in oil and gas companies increasing their capital expenditures 
however  the company cannot predict when such recovery might occur 
the company projects that considering the industry expectations  its capital expenditures will be smaller than recent fiscal periods 
however  the company is committed to completing the conversion of the hercules  the construction of the carlyss  louisiana  deepwater support facility and pipebase  and the construction of a shorebase facility in batam  indonesia 
also  as the company has historically done  it will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of equipment or businesses 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires  among other things  that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure the instruments at fair value 
the company does not believe that the adoption of this new accounting standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
the company will adopt this accounting standard  if applicable  effective january   as required 
year the year problem results from the use in computer hardware and software of two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
the use of two digits was a common practice for decades when computer storage and processing was much more expensive than today 
when computer systems must process dates both before and after january   two digit year fields may create processing ambiguities that can cause errors and system failures 
for example  computer programs that have date sensitive features may recognize a date represented by as the year  instead of these errors or failures may have limited effects  or the effects may be widespread  depending on the computer chip  system or software  and its location and function 
the effects of the year problem are exacerbated because of the interdependence of computer and telecommunications systems in the united states and throughout the world 
this interdependence certainly is true for global and global s suppliers  and customers  as well as for governments of countries around the world where global does business 
the company makes use of computers in its gathering  manipulating  calculating  and reporting of accounting  financial  administrative  and management information 
we also rely on computers to undertake certain operational procedures and to more efficiently produce documents and financial instruments 
additionally  the company uses computers as a communication tool for its employees to communicate among themselves and with other persons outside the organization 
finally  certain of the company s equipment including the dynamic positioning systems on certain of the company s vessels  makes use of embedded computer technology 
readiness 
the company has prepared a year project plan the yk plan to identify and assess its risks associated with year issues and to take reasonable steps to prevent global s critical functions from being impaired 
global is currently implementing its yk plan  which will be modified as events require 
under the plan  the company continues to i assess its critical information and computing systems and ii inventory its systems using embedded technology  including our fleet of offshore vessels and related systems  assess the effects of year problems on the critical functions of global s business units  remedy systems  software and embedded chips in an effort to avoid material disruptions or other material adverse effects on critical functions  processes and systems  verify and test the critical systems to which remediation efforts have been applied  and attempt to mitigate those critical aspects of the year problem that are not remediated by january   including the development of contingency plans to cope with the mission critical consequences of year problems that have not been identified or remediated by that date 
implementation of our yk plan is supervised by a vice president and the company has contracted with firms specializing in the assessment and remediation of embedded technology for additional assistance 
as a result of the assessments  non compliant embedded technology has been found on certain of the company s vessels 
the company plans to complete the identification and remediation of mission critical systems that require modification or replacement by mid the yk plan recognizes that the computer  telecommunications  and other systems outside systems of outside entities outside entities have the potential for major  mission critical  adverse effects on the conduct of global s business 
global does not have control of these outside entities or outside systems 
in some cases  outside entities are foreign governments or businesses located in foreign countries 
however  global s yk plan includes an ongoing process of identifying and contacting outside entities whose systems  in global s judgment  have or may have a substantial effect on our ability to continue to conduct the mission critical aspects of our business without disruption from year problems 
the company has contacted its key vendors and customers to assess their progress with their own year issues and to anticipate potential risks associated with its key vendors and customers 
global will work prudently with outside entities in a reasonable attempt to inventory  assess  analyze  convert where necessary  test  and develop contingency plans for global s connections to these mission critical outside systems and to ascertain the extent to which they are  or can be made to be  year ready and compatible with global s mission critical systems 
despite efforts to address all material year issues in advance  the company could potentially experience disruptions to some aspects of its activities or operations 
thus  the company is developing business contingency plans for mitigating the effect of potential disruptions 
costs 
total amounts spent to date on year awareness  inventory  assessment  analysis  conversion  testing or contingency planning efforts were approximately  additional costs to carry out the yk plan  including implementation of year contingency plan  based on assessments to date  are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition 
although management believes that its estimates are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the actual costs of implementing the yk plan will not differ materially from the estimated costs or that global will not be materially adversely affected by year issues 
moreover  the estimated costs of implementing the yk plan do not take into account the costs  if any  that might be incurred as a result of year related failures that occur despite global s implementation of the yk plan 
worst case scenario 
the securities and exchange commission requires that public companies forecast the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
in doing so  global is assuming that the company s yk plan will not be effective 
analysis of the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios global may face leads to contemplation of the following possibilities which  though unlikely in some or many cases  must be included in any consideration of worst cases widespread failure of electrical  gas  and similar supplies by utilities serving global domestically and internationally  widespread disruption of the services of communications common carriers domestically and internationally  similar disruption to means and modes of transportation for global and its employees  contractors  suppliers  and customers  significant disruption to global s ability to gain access to  and remain working in  office buildings and other facilities  the failure of substantial numbers of global s critical information computer hardware and software systems  and the failure  domestically and internationally  of outside systems  the effects of which would have a cumulative material adverse impact on global s critical systems 
among other things  global could face substantial claims by customers or loss of revenues due to inability to fulfill contractual obligations  inability to account for certain revenues or obligations or to bill customers accurately and on a timely basis  and increased expenses associated with litigation  stabilization of operations following critical failures  and the execution of contingency plans 
global could also experience an inability by customers to pay  on a timely basis or at all  obligations owed to global 
under these circumstances  the adverse effect on global  and the diminution of global s revenues  would be material  although not quantifiable at this time 
summary 
global has a plan to deal with the year challenge and believes that it will be able to achieve substantial year readiness with respect to the mission critical systems that it controls 
however  from a forward looking perspective  the extent and magnitude of the year problem as it will affect global  both before and for some period after january   are difficult to predict or quantify for a number of reasons 
among these are the difficulty of locating embedded chips that may be in a great variety of mission critical systems  the difficulty of inventorying  assessing  remediating  verifying and testing outside systems  the difficulty in locating all mission critical software computer code internal to global that is not year compatible  and the unavailability of certain necessary internal or external resources  including but not limited to trained hardware and software engineers  technicians  and other personnel to perform adequate remediation  verification and testing of mission critical global systems or outside systems 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that all of global s systems and all outside systems will be adequately remediated so that they are year ready by january   or by some earlier date  so as not to create a material disruption to global s business 
if despite global s efforts  there are mission critical year related failures that create substantial disruptions to our business  the adverse impact on global s business could be material 
additionally  year costs are difficult to estimate accurately because of unanticipated vendor delays  technical difficulties  the impact of tests of outside systems and similar events
