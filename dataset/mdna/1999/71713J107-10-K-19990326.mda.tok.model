item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
the company s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements for various reasons  including development risks  the possibility of pressure from managed care hospitals to decrease prices  the availability of products from vendors  the timing of orders from customers  the ability to determine proper inventory levels and the possibility of additional competition entering the point of care hemostasis monitoring market 
additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward looking statements is contained herein including under the heading factors that may affect future results and in the company s other sec filings  copies of which are available upon request 
cvdi is located in raleigh  north carolina  within a  square foot facility housing office space  research labs and manufacturing clean rooms 
cvdi develops  manufactures and markets the thrombolytic assessment system tas  a proprietary cardiovascular diagnostic test system that provides rapid and accurate evaluation of hemostasis at the point of patient care 
cvdi s subsidiary  coeur laboratories  inc coeur  located within the raleigh facility  assembles and sells disposable power injection syringes used for cardiology and radiology procedures 
the company derives income from the following sources tas and coeur product sales  grants  interest income  and development income recognized in connection with collaboration agreements 
coeur product sales in  and represented  and  respectively  of total company sales 
during  the company had salespeople covering the major metropolitan areas across the united states and nine distributors selling into countries 
because of the speed and the ease of use of the tas product and the high correlation between the testing results from cvdi s product with the testing results obtained by hospitals central laboratories  the laboratory response to cvdi s technology was largely positive 
however  since  individual hospitals have continued to consolidate into ihns  which delayed many pending decisions to adopt the new technology provided by tas  and created a demand for standardized test results from one hospital to another 
cvdi offers a technological breakthrough capable of providing rapid diagnostic test results standardized to the central laboratory tests 
given the consolidation in the hospital industry  cvdi determined that distribution arrangements  rather than a direct sales force  were needed to penetrate the market 
in  cvdi signed a north american distribution agreement with dade  in cvdi signed additional distribution agreements in niche markets with avecor cardiovascular and johnson johnson s ortho clinical diagnostics spa in italy  and in august cvdi signed a global distribution agreement with chiron diagnostics which has or will replace the distribution agreements which existed prior to such date 
see item business 
these agreements allowed the company to reduce its sale force and are consistent with the company s strategy of seeking to provide a comprehensive  standardized  rapid  point of care hemostasis testing solution  while also developing specialty tests that should have higher margins 
the growth of large ihns has given them increased purchasing power which  along with competition from existing testing procedures for routine coagulation tests  has put pricing pressure on the company s test cards 
the company s agreements with its distributors provide for fixed prices  which the company could be forced to reduce as a result of pricing pressure 
fixed pricing could also have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations if its costs increase unexpectedly 
given the consolidating hospital market and pricing pressures  the company s strategy has evolved towards becoming more focused on the development of specialty tests for drugs  some with narrow ranges between over and under dosage 
the company believes that rapid diagnostic capabilities improve patient care and turnover  and that there is a market trend to obtain diagnostic information faster in order to effect therapy sooner 
the company also believes that these trends should allow the company to obtain higher pricing of these specialty tests 
as a result  during and the company exhibited the flexibility of the tas platform and the potential to expand its menu of specialty tests by signing collaboration agreements with knoll ag  eli lilly and company and astra ab to monitor the effects of certain new drugs that are in clinical trials 
the company believes that these and other collaborations for specialty tests will also further demand for analyzers and routine anticoagulant tests 
the company believes it is well positioned in its development efforts to expand its menu of tests to monitor developmental drugs where rapid therapeutic intervention is needed 
results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  sales for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in tas analyzer revenue increased approximately  due to a large order from knoll received early in the year and test card revenue increased  principally due to sales of specialty cards to knoll and astra during these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue from dade 
coeur product sales of million were virtually unchanged from prior year sales of million 
the total gross profit margin improved in to compared to in mainly due to higher average sale prices for tas analyzers and specialty test cards 
coeur gross margins decreased slightly from due to higher product costs 
total operating expenses for of million represents a decrease of approximately  or compared to general and administrative expenses declined due to lower litigation expenses and fewer personnel 
sales and marketing expenses also declined due to fewer personnel and the elimination of a sales office in germany in late the reduced personnel also led to decreased travel costs compared to research and development expenses  which mainly relate to the company s tas products  increased approximately in compared to the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs  higher cost of supplies and validation processes related to on going development projects 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  in the prior year 
the increase was due to the long term debt financing obtained by the company in december interest income decreased approximately  in compared to due to decreased investment balances during the year as funds were used to support operations 
grant and development income in was approximately  a  decrease compared to the decrease in grant income was expected as the company s nih grant expired during development income also decreased as fewer milestones related to collaborative agreements were reached during compared to year ended december  vs 
year ended december  sales for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in test card sales increased  and other tas product sales increased  from the prior year as a result of the initiation of the distribution agreement with dade 
coeur product sales increased to  from the prior year 
the gross profit margin for increased slightly to from in coeur gross margins increased slightly due to higher volumes and certain decreases in product costs 
total operating expenses in were million  an increase of approximately  from general and administrative expenses in were million  an increase of  or  from principal factors contributing to the increase were legal expenses  additional staffing and recruiting expenses  and increased facility expenses  including rent  depreciation and consulting related to equipment upgrades 
sales and marketing expenses in of million decreased approximately  from  primarily due to the reduction of the company s sales force in september after the dade distribution agreement was signed 
research and development expenses for were million  a increase from  primarily due to increased clinical trial expenses related to collaborations for new test card products entered into during interest income decreased significantly in compared to due to smaller cash balances during as funds were used for operations 
development income increased to  in from in as milestones were achieved under collaborative agreements entered into in and other comprehensive loss income in and consists of foreign currency translation adjustments related to a foreign subsidiary 
operations of the subsidiary were ceased during liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million  as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  the company s primary source of liquidity during was the receipt of a  equity investment from chiron diagnostics in conjunction with the signing of a global distribution agreement in august for certain test cards of the company 
this increase in liquidity was partially offset by repayment of debt and the operating loss 
during  the company used cash in operating activities of million 
the use of cash was primarily due to funding the net operating loss of the company and growth in the company s receivables and inventories due to increased revenues 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the net cash used in resulted mainly from the purchase of short term investments and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for were million 
these capital expenditures were primarily for additional automated tas test card production equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company expects to incur capital expenditures of  to  during cash provided by financing activities was million in net cash provided by financing activities for resulted from the equity investment from chiron diagnostics partially offset by debt repayments and payments under capital leases 
the company expects to incur additional operating losses during the company s working capital requirements will depend on many factors  primarily the volume of subsequent orders of tas products from distributors  primarily bayer diagnostics 
in addition  the company expects to incur costs associated with clinical trials for new test cards 
the company may acquire other products  technologies or businesses that complement the company s existing and planned products  although the company currently has no understanding  commitment or agreement with respect to any such acquisitions 
in addition  the company may consider a joint venture or the sale of manufacturing rights to complete the commercialization of its routine anticoagulant monitoring tests 
management believes that its existing capital resources and cash flows from operations  including that from under its distribution agreement with bayer diagnostics  will be adequate to satisfy its planned capital requirements through to enhance liquidity in future years  the company plans to consider external sources of financing as needed 
in addition to other debt financings such as a working capital line of credit  the company also plans to consider equity financings such as a private placement  a secondary public offering of common stock or additional equity infusions from collaborative partners 
year computers  software and microprocessors that use only two digits to identify a year in a date field may be unable to process accurately certain date based information at or after the year this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the company is addressing the issue in several ways 
first  the company has established a team to monitor product compliance and believes that all company products are year compliant 
secondly  the company is in the process of seeking year compliance certification from its major suppliers and vendors related to their products and internal business applications 
finally  the company has established a team to coordinate year compliance related to internal systems 
many of the company s systems use vendor provided software and year compliance is expected to be achieved through vendor provided upgrades 
for other internal systems  testing will be completed internally to ensure year compliance 
currently  the company has completed its assessment and testing of year compliance with respect to all of its own products  of its own internal systems and approximately of its vendor provided systems and applications 
the company anticipates all of its systems will have been assessed and updated through vendor provider upgrades or through completion of internal testing prior to june  the company believes that the cost of its year compliance program  which solely relates to internal personnel time  has been approximately  through december  and will be approximately  in total 
the company does not believe that its business will be materially adversely affected by the year issue 
however  the company continues to bear risk related to the year and could be materially adversely affected if significant customers or suppliers fail to address the issue or if vendor upgrades are not provided to the company as required 
in a worst case scenario  the company could be forced to spend significant resources and funds to find alternative providers of systems and applications used by the company 
if completion of the company s assessment of vendor provided systems reveals year non compliance  the company s contingency plan is to insist upon vendor compliance a reasonable time in advance of year and to pursue arrangements with other vendors 
factors that may affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that may affect the company s future operating results and stock price  including risks associated with development of new tests  particularly specialty tests that rely on development  regulatory approval  commercialization and market acceptance of collaborators new drugs  market acceptance of tas  the company s continuing losses and the resulting potential need for additional capital in the future  managed care and continuing market consolidation  which may result in price pressure  particularly on routine tests  and fda regulations and other regulatory guidelines affecting the company and or its collaborators 
the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in the company s quarterly operating results as well as other factors which may be unrelated to the company s performance 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of and announcements concerning public companies 
such broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
securities of issuers having relatively limited capitalization or securities recently issued in an initial public offering are particularly susceptible to volatility based on short term trading strategies of certain investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to variety of risks including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and long term debt 
the company s investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase between three and nine months 
due to the short term nature of the company s debt investments and the company s intention to hold these investments until maturity  the impact of interest rate changes would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company has long term debt obligations at a fixed interest rate 
given the fixed rate nature of this debt  the impact of interest rate changes also would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations
