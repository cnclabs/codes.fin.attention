year the company recognizes that year issues may have an impact on its business  operations and financial condition 
the company has completed an assessment of its year readiness with respect to all of its information technology it systems and is currently addressing the reliability and condition of its non it systems 
these assessments will continue to be updated as additional information becomes available and as new concerns are identified 
the company s it systems generally consist of file servers  operating systems  application programs and workstations that utilize purchased and customized software 
the company continues to evaluate the year compliance status of each vendor and tenant and believes that its existing systems or planned upgrades during will be year compliant 
implementation and upgrades of non year compliant systems are not expected to result in significant additional cost to the company 
the company s non it systems which may be subject to year issues are facility related and encompass areas such as hvac systems  elevators  security  lighting  telecommunications  electrical  plumbing  fire and sprinkler controls 
the company is currently addressing the potential impact of year issues in these areas and has not identified any instances where year issues will require material costs to repair or replace any of these systems 
the significant risks to the company in the event that year issues are not identified and corrected are that the company could experience delays or errors in processing financial and operation information 
non it system problems could result in forced closure of certain facilities  which could limit the efficient operation of the company s properties 
contingency plans will be developed if it appears the company or its key suppliers and tenants will not be year compliant  and such noncompliance is expected to have a significant adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
inflation substantially  all of the leases at the company s properties provide for tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance and real estate taxes  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
many of the tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include the ability to receive percentage rentals based on a tenant s gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which may enable the operating partnership to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base and or percentage rentals if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate
