revenues from the four companies acquired in were approximately  representing nearly of the growth in revenues 
the remainder of the growth in revenues was internally generated growth which equates to approximately a growth rate 
the internal growth in revenues trailed the internal growth rate in the number of employees  which was nearly  due to the timing of new client sign ups  more of which occurred in the second half of direct costs salaries and wages of worksite employees were  for the year ended december   a increase over s salaries and wage expense of  payroll taxes  workers compensation  etc

earnings per share declined from 
per share for basic and diluted earnings per share in to 
for basic earnings per share and 
for diluted earnings per share in due to the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the december ipo and the issuance of  shares for acquisitions in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had a working capital surplus of  at december   the working capital surplus was  the decrease in working capital correlates with the use of temporary cash investments to acquire five peo s in the company s primary source of liquidity and capital resources has historically been its internal cash flow from operations 
in addition  in december  net cash of  was provided from an initial public offering of company stock 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company recognizes as revenue and as unbilled receivables  on an accrual basis  any such amounts which relate to services performed by worksite employees as of the end of each accounting period which have not yet been billed to the client because of timing differences between the day the company s accounting period ends and the billing dates for client payroll periods that include the day the company s accounting period ends 
the amount of unbilled receivables  as well as accrued liabilities and client deposits  have increased with the growth of the company 
for work performed prior to the termination of a client agreement  the company may be obligated  as an employer  to pay the gross salaries and wages of the client s worksite employees and the related employment taxes and workers  compensation costs  whether or not the company s client pays the company on a timely basis or at all 
the company  however  historically has not incurred significant bad debt expenses because the company generally collects from its clients all revenues with respect to each payroll period in advance of the company s payment of the direct costs associated therewith 
the company attempts to minimize its credit risk by investigating and monitoring the credit history and financial strength of its clients and by generally requiring payments be made by wire transfer  immediately available funds or ach transfer 
with respect to ach transfers  the company is obligated to pay the client s worksite employees if there are insufficient funds in the client s bank account on the payroll date 
the company s policy  however  is only to permit clients with a proven credit history with the company to pay by ach transfer 
in addition  in the rare event of nonpayment by a client  the company has the ability to terminate immediately its contract with the client 
the company also protects itself by obtaining  when it deems necessary  unconditional personal guarantees from the owners of a client and or a cash security deposit  bank letter of credit or pledge of certificates of deposits 
as of december  and  the company held cash security deposits in the amounts of  and  respectively 
additional sources of funds to the company are advance payments of employment taxes and insurance premiums which the company holds until they are due and payable to the respective taxing authorities and insurance providers 
net cash used in investing activities was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the principal use of cash from investing activities was the purchase of computer equipment and software to support the growth of the business 
also  during   was paid toward the purchase of five peo companies 
in addition to the cash paid for acquisitions   shares of the company s common stock were also issued and  without either an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration  these shares are unregistered restricted shares and cannot be sold for a one year period from the date of issuance 
four acquisitions were completed in for total cash paid of   treasury shares and  newly issued unregistered shares were also used in these acquisitions 
in september  the company s board of directors approved a share repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
in   shares were repurchased at a cost of  financing activities are not material as the company has no debt or significant capital leases 
presently  the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
primary new uses of cash may include acquisitions  the size and timing of which cannot be predicted 
however  the company is limited in its ability to continue to acquire other peo companies unless it can raise additional capital since most acquisitions involve the payment of cash and the issuance of stock for the purchase price and may also require some additional working capital following acquisition 
in july  the company obtained a  revolving credit agreement with a bank 
the credit agreement provides for borrowings at the prime rate or libor plus 
the credit agreement requires the company to maintain certain financial standards as to net worth and ebitda and also requires the bank s consent to acquisitions 
there were no borrowings under any revolving credit agreement in the company has guaranteed the price of  shares at for the one year period from october  to october  in  the company advanced  to the holder of  shares 
the advance is secured by the shares which are held by the company 
the company is obligated to pay the holder of the remaining  shares the difference between and the price realized upon sale of the shares 
as of march    shares have been sold and the company has reimbursed  to the holder 
effective january   the company s founder and chairman resigned his position with the company 
in lieu of any other separation payments that may have been required  the company agreed to acquire  shares at per share from the former chairman 
the shares were acquired on february  for a cash payment of  and two notes bearing interest at 
one note  in the amount of  is due upon demand 
the other note  in the amount of  is due on february  on february   the company borrowed  on its line of credit 
the company believes that the net proceeds from the sale of its common stock in december which were invested in marketable securities and certificates of deposit  together with existing cash  cash equivalents and internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet the company s presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  excluding acquisitions of other peo s for the foreseeable future 
to the extent that the company needs additional capital resources  the company believes that it will have access to existing bank financing and other alternative sources of capital 
however  there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
the company did not pay dividends in   or  and does not expect to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future 
year state of readiness the company s primary business is the delivery of payroll and hr services to a widely diverse and geographically dispersed small business clientele 
the company s data processing systems are integral and critical to the efficient and effective delivery of its services 
more specifically  the company relies on these systems for preparing and processing client payrolls  payroll tax filings  benefits plan activities  insurance costs and client invoicing 
beginning in  the company began developing a new system that would better meet the needs of a rapidly growing company and that would also improve client service and operational efficiency 
this new system is teamdirect tm 
although this systems project was not embarked upon to address the year issue  the result of this project is that teamdirect tm has been designed to be year compliant 
the company believes teamdirect tm is year compliant in all respects 
it is written on an oracle database engine 
the company has not specifically tested the system for year compliance  but intends to do so in the first half of since september  the company has acquired eight peo s outside of ohio 
these companies have operated on their own systems since being acquired 
their systems have not been evaluated for year compliance because they will be converted to teamdirect tm before the year as of march   all of the company s original core business and the acquired businesses in idaho  utah  montana and michigan have been converted to the new system 
all locations are expected to be on teamdirect tm by mid the company believes it does not have any non it systems that would result in a material adverse impact to the company if they are not year compliant 
the company relies upon large regional banks to process its electronic and non electronic banking and disbursement activities 
it also contracts with large well known national and regional insurance carriers to provide and or administer its employee benefits plans and insurance programs 
the company has not specifically approached these institutions about their ability to handle the company s business transactions in the year if necessary  the company believes it will have adequate time to switch to year compliant providers  if there are any  prior to the end of the company s customer base is primarily small businesses located throughout the mid west  south and western regions of the united states 
no one client is material to the company s operations 
the company has not evaluated the extent of year readiness by its customers 
the company is exploring alternative energy sources  such as diesel generators  at its main corporate facility where its teamdirect tm system is based  in case of utility service disruption 
the company also has the ability to process from remote backup locations over the internet  if the internet is operational in the year the company has not yet obtained cost estimates for the alternative energy sources 
the company believes that the disruption of utility services at any of its locations outside of its main corporate office would not have a material effect on its operations as long as internet or phone access is possible 
the company  however  has not addressed or evaluated the effects that disruption of phone service or internet service nationally or regionally would have on its operations 
costs the company has not separately identified costs associated with year compliance because it has not undertaken year compliance as a specific project and has not employed outside consultants  etc 
to address year compliance 
the company believes that its development of teamdirect tm will result in its primary operating systems being year compliant 
risks of failure the company believes that if its primary operating system is not year compliant  or if its banking and insurance vendors are not year compliant  there would be significant material adverse consequences 
the company could have difficulty meeting its obligations to its clients to provide timely payrolls and administer employee benefits and insurance programs 
this could result in lost business and or significant increases in operating costs which may not be recoverable through price increases to our clients 
the potential loss of business or increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
contingency plan as of march   the company has not yet developed a contingency plan to address needed actions in the event of failure of its systems or significant vendor systems to be year compliant 
inflation the company believes the effects of inflation have not had a significant impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited operating results of each of the nine consecutive quarters in the period ended december  which comprise all of the quarterly periods following the company s initial public offering of its common stock on december  the information is unaudited  but in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations of such periods
