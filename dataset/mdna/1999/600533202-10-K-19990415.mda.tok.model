item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview miller is an independent oil and gas exploration  development and production company that has developed a base of producing properties and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inventory of prospects in mississippi  louisiana  texas  michigan  montana and north dakota 
the company was organized in connection with the combination transaction 
the combined assets consist of moc  interests in oil and natural gas properties from the affiliated entities and interests in such properties owned by certain business partners and investors  including ahc  dan a 
hughes  jr 
and sasi minerals company 
no assets other than those in which moc or the affiliated entities had an interest were part of the combined assets 
the company and the owners of the combined assets entered into separate agreements that provided for the issuance of approximately million shares of the company s common stock and the payment of million net of post closing adjustments in cash to certain participants in the combination transaction in exchange for the combined assets 
the issuance of the shares and the cash payment were completed upon consummation of the company s offering 
the combination transaction closed on february  in connection with the closing of the offering 
the offering  including the sale of an additional  shares of common stock by the company on march  pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million after expenses 
for further discussion of the offering and the combination transaction  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including any general and administrative costs that directly are attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
sec regulation s x  rule requires companies reporting on a full cost basis to apply a ceiling test wherein the capitalized costs within the full cost pool may not exceed the net present value of the company s proved oil and gas reserves plus the lower of cost or market of unproved properties 
any such excess costs should be charged against earnings 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and average costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the periods presented in thousands  except per unit amounts year ended december  historical pro forma production volumes crude oil and condensate mbbls natural gas mmcf       natural gas equivalent mmcfe       average sales prices crude oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe average costs per mcfe lease operating expenses and production taxes depletion  depreciation and amortization general and administrative because of the significance of the combination transaction which occurred on february   the results of operations have been presented above on a pro forma and historical basis  and the results of operations will be described below on a pro forma basis to make the comparative analyses more meaningful 
for additional information regarding the combination transaction  see note to the consolidated financial statements and the pro forma statements of operations in this filing 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued pro forma year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the revenues for the year ended december  include approximately million of hedging gains see risk management activities and derivative transactions below 
production volumes for natural gas during the year ended december  increased to  mmcf from  mmcf for the year ended december  average natural gas prices decreased to per mcf for the year ended december  from per mcf for the year ended december  production volumes for oil during the year ended december  increased to mbbls from mbbls for the year ended december  average oil prices decreased to per barrel during the year ended december  from per barrel in the year ended december  the oil and gas industry suffered through a year of historically low oil prices in  caused by a global influx of crude oil supply brought on by increased middle east exports combined with a weaker demand from asian markets that were experiencing an economic recession 
the natural gas market also was depressed as a result of abnormally mild winters caused by a strong el nino weather pattern that affected the united states during the past two heating seasons 
the company would have experienced an even larger decrease in revenue had it not been for the natural gas hedging gains of approximately million and the fact that only of total operating revenues for were attributable to oil production 
lease operating expenses and production taxes for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  lease operating expenses and production taxes increased primarily due to increased production as described above and to several workover projects that were completed during the year in an attempt to enhance production during a period of low commodity prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a increase in the depletion rate to per mcfe from 
per mcfe for the year ended december  the higher depletion rate was the combined result of increased production  an increase in costs subject to dd a and a downward revision in estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the same period in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the rise in general and administrative costs is primarily attributable to added expenses associated with the company s initial year as a public company 
these incremental expenses include legal and professional fees paid to attorneys and accountants  increased rents related to office facilities in mississippi and increased salaries and benefits due to additional financial  technical  operational and administrative staff added during the year 
on march   the company s board of directors approved a general and administrative cost reduction plan for the plan calls for an overall reduction in general and administrative costs from of 
cost reductions will be implemented in several areas  however  the largest cost reductions will be in the area of salaries and benefits which constitute of the anticipated total general and administrative reductions for at december   the company recorded a non cash cost ceiling writedown of million 
the writedown was the combined result of a large downward revision in oil and gas reserve quantities and depressed commodity prices 
disappointing d seismic supported drilling results and drilling cost overruns also contributed to the cost ceiling writedown 
the company based its ceiling test determination on a price of per mcfe  which represents the march closing commodity prices 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of increased debt levels in for substantial exploration and development activities in the mississippi salt basin area 
net income loss for the year ended december  decreased by million to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of the factors described above 
pro forma year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the same period in production volumes for natural gas during the year ended december  decreased to  mmcf from  mmcf for the year ended december  average natural gas prices increased to per mcf for the year ended december  from per mcf for the year ended december  production volumes for oil during the year ended december  decreased to mbbls from mbbls for the year ended december  average oil prices decreased to per barrel during the year ended december  from per barrel for the year ended december  this decrease in oil and gas revenues is attributable to decreased production as well as the cyclical fluctuations in crude oil prices 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued lease operating expenses and production taxes for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  lease operating expenses and production taxes increased primarily due to decreased production while fixed costs remained greater than variable costs resulting in an increase in operating expenses per equivalent unit to 
per mcfe for the year ended december  from 
per mcfe for the year ended december  dd a expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to decreased production  offset by a increase in the depletion rate to per mcfe from per mcfe for the year ended december  the higher depletion rate was the combined result of decreased production and an increase in costs subject to dd a 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of increases in the number of employees and related salaries and benefits 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the same period in  as a result of increased debt levels in incurred to finance substantial leasehold acquisition activities in the mississippi salt basin area 
net income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary sources of capital have been funds generated by operations  capital contributions and borrowings  primarily from moc s shareholders and under bank credit facilities 
the company has entered into a credit facility the credit facility with bank of montreal  houston agency bmo 
the credit facility consists of a three year revolving line of credit converting to a three year term loan 
the amount of credit available during the revolving period and the debt allowed during the term period may not exceed the company s borrowing base  or the amount of debt that bmo and the other lenders under the credit facility agree can be supported by the cash flow generated by the company s producing and non producing proved oil and natural gas reserves 
the borrowing base may not exceed million 
amounts advanced under the credit facility bear interest  payable quarterly  at either i bmo s announced item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued prime rate or ii the london inter bank offered rate plus a margin rate ranging from to  as selected by the company 
in addition  the company is assessed a commitment fee equal to of the unused portion of the borrowing base  payable quarterly in arrears  until the termination of the revolving period 
at the termination of the revolving period  the revolving line of credit will convert to a three year term loan with principal payable in equal quarterly installments 
the credit facility includes certain negative covenants that impose limitations on the company and its subsidiaries with respect to  among other things  distributions with respect to its capital stock  limitations on financial ratios  the creation or incurrence of liens  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  making loans and investments and mergers and consolidations 
the obligations of the company under the credit facility are secured by a lien on all real and hydrocarbon personal property of the company  including its oil and natural gas properties 
at december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
as a result of decreased proved oil and gas reserves at december   bmo has notified the company that the company s borrowing base was in noncompliance and certain principal obligations were being accelerated during additionally  the company was in violation of certain negative covenants under the credit facility  primarily as a result of the million non cash cost ceiling writedown at december  on april   the company and bmo signed the second amendment to the credit facility which includes i terms requiring the company to make principal payments to bmo of million by may   million by may  and million by the first of each month during the period july through october  inclusive  ii terms requiring that all outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus  iii a waiver of all negative covenant violations until october  the re determination date  iv revised negative covenant provisions which take effect on the re determination date  v a requirement to submit a revised reserve report to bmo by october  for a re determination of the borrowing base  vi a requirement that all proceeds from the sales of oil and gas properties  additional debt financings or equity offerings  prior to the re determination date  must be used to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the credit facility  and vii a requirement for a  amendment fee payable to bmo at the re determination date 
at the re determination date  the company will be required to make additional payments of principal to the extent its outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base 
to fulfill the may principal and interest obligations  management plans to sell certain oil and gas property interests to business partners  investors and affiliated entities 
all other principal and interest obligations are expected to be fulfilled through available cash flows  additional property sales or other financing sources  including the possible issuance of additional equity securities as item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued well as identifying additional sources for debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will issue additional equity securities or that the company will obtain additional sources of debt financing or that the terms of any such financing will be on more favorable terms than the terms of the credit facility 
on april   the company signed a million note payable with one its suppliers  veritas dgc land  inc the veritas note payable  for the outstanding balance due to veritas for past services provided in and veritas conducted the d seismic surveys covering substantially all of the square miles of d seismic data in the mississippi salt basin that the company acquired from veritas in at a total cost of approximately million 
the balance due veritas was million at december   and has been classified as long term debt in the accompanying financial statements 
the principal obligation under the veritas note payable is due on april  management plans to fulfill the principal obligation under the veritas note payable from available cash flows  property sales and other financing sources 
on april   the company also signed an agreement the warrant agreement to issue warrants that entitle veritas to subscribe and purchase shares of the company s common stock in lieu of receiving cash payments for the accrued interest obligations under the veritas note payable 
the warrant agreement requires the company to issue warrants to veritas in conjunction with the signing of the warrant agreement  as well as on the six  and month anniversaries of the warrant agreement 
the warrants to be issued must equal of the then current outstanding principal balance of the veritas note payable 
the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants will be determined on a five day average closing price of the company s common stock 
the exercise price of each warrant is per share 
the company has the option  in lieu of issuing warrants  at the and month anniversaries to make a cash payment to veritas  equivalent to of the then current principal balance of the veritas note payable 
under the terms of the warrant agreement  all warrants issued will expire on april  in addition  the company also signed an agreement with veritas that i requires the company to file a registration statement with the sec to register shares of common stock that are issuable upon exercise of the above warrants and ii grants certain piggy back registration rights in connection with the warrants 
the shares required to be registered include only those shares required to be issued at each six month anniversary 
in connection with the closing of the ahc acquisition  the company has a note payable to ahc of million at december  which is payable on the anniversary date of the closing as follows million in  million in and million in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at december   the company had a working capital deficit of million excluding the current portion of long term debt 
management plans to meet these working capital requirements from available cash flows  property sales and other financing sources 
the company has budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for capital expenditures will be used to fund drilling and development activities  the completion of d seismic surveys that were in process at december  and leasehold acquisitions and extensions in the company s project areas 
the actual amounts of capital expenditures and number of wells drilled may differ significantly from such estimates 
actual capital expenditures for the year ended december  were approximately million 
the company intends to fund its budgeted capital expenditures through operational cash flow 
the company s revenues  profitability  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of its properties  substantially are dependent on prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
the company cannot predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
declines in prices received for oil and natural gas as experienced in have had an adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower prices in also had an impact on the amount of reserves that can be produced economically by the company 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements primarily due to the company s active exploration and development programs and technology enhancement programs 
while the company believes that cash flow from operations  property sales  borrowings and substantially reduced commodity prices should allow the company to implement its present business strategy through  additional debt or equity financing may be required during the remainder of and in the future to fund the company s growth  development and exploration program and continued technological enhancement and to satisfy its existing obligations 
the failure to obtain and exploit such capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company  including further curtailment of its exploration and other activities 
risk management activities and derivative transactions the company uses a variety of derivative instruments derivatives to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
to qualify for hedge accounting  derivatives must meet the following criteria i the item to be hedged exposes the company to price or item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest rate risk  and ii the derivative reduces that exposure and is designated as a hedge 
commodity price hedges in  the company began using certain derivatives eg  nymex futures contracts for a portion of its natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce the exposure to price fluctuations 
the company s hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of its production  provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limit potential gains from future increases in prices 
such hedging arrangements may expose the company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected  the company s customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil or natural gas or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
for financial reporting purposes  gains and losses related to hedging are recognized as oil and natural gas revenues during the period the hedged transactions occur 
the company expects that the amount of hedge contracts that it has in place will vary from time to time 
the company s hedging strategy is to maximize its return on investment through hedging a portion of its activities relating to natural gas price volatility 
while this strategy should help the company reduce its exposure to price risks  it also limits the company s potential gains from increases in market prices for natural gas 
the company intends to continue to hedge up to of its natural gas production to retain a portion of the potential for greater upside from increases in natural gas prices  while limiting to some extent the company s exposure to declines in natural gas prices 
for the year ended december   the company had hedged of its natural gas production  and as of december   the company had bcf of open natural gas contracts for the months of february and march subsequent to december   the company entered into additional natural gas contracts for approximately bcf for the time period of april to june open contracts totaling bcf have been settled subsequently in  resulting in hedge profits of approximately million 
interest rate hedge the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective november   to exchange the variable rate interest payment obligation under the credit facility without exchanging the underlying principal amount 
this agreement converts the variable rate debt to fixed rate debt to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
the notional amount is item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the exposure to credit loss 
the notional amount of the company s interest rate swap was million at december   and had a fair value of approximately million 
the difference between the amounts paid and received under the swap is accrued and recorded as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the hedged agreement  which was to expire february  subsequent to year end  the company terminated its interest rate swap agreement and received million  which will be recognized in earnings ratably as the related outstanding loan balance is amortized 
market risk information the market risk inherent in the company s derivatives is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
the prices of natural gas are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
to reduce price risk caused by the market fluctuations  the company s policy is to hedge through the use of derivatives future production 
because commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company sells in the physical market  no special correlation studies other than monitoring the degree of convergence between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
the changes in market value of these derivatives have a high correlation to the price changes of natural gas 
as all derivatives that were outstanding at december   have been settled subsequent to year end  the company s exposure is limited to the actual results described above 
effects of inflation and changes in price in  the company and the oil and gas industry as a whole  experienced historically low crude oil prices and substantially depressed natural gas prices 
these lower commodity prices had a negative impact on the company s results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
recent rates of inflation have had a minimal effect on the company 
environmental and other regulatory matters the company s business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by laws and regulations frequently item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued are changed and subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
any suspensions  terminations or inability to meet applicable bonding requirements could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to the company  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of the company 
future regulations may add to the cost of  or significantly limit  drilling activity 
year readiness disclosure this year readiness disclosure is based upon and partially repeats information provided by the company s outside consultants and others regarding the year readiness of the company and its customers  suppliers  financial institutions and other parties 
although the company believes this information to be accurate  it has not independently verified such information 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company has initiated a plan to prepare its computer systems and applications for possible year problems 
under the plan  the company will continue to identify its computer hardware and software systems and equipment with embedded computer chips  assess the effects of the year issues  and enhance the plan by developing the steps necessary to identify  correct or reprogram and test systems for year compliance 
the company has completed approximately of the year modifications on its networked computer applications 
the company will continue to assess the impact of the year issue on its systems and applications throughout the company s goal is to perform tests of its systems and applications during and to have systems and applications year ready by july  allowing the remaining time to be used for validation and testing 
the company expects to incur internal staff costs as well as consulting and other expenses to prepare the systems for the year item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company expects to spend no more than  in connection with identifying  assessing  remediating and testing year issues 
the company expects that it will expense all costs associated with system changes 
the company also may invest in new or upgraded technology which has a definable value lasting beyond in these instances  where year compliance is merely ancillary  the company may capitalize and depreciate such an asset over its estimated useful life 
based on currently available information  management does not anticipate that the costs to address the year issues will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the extent to which the computer operations and other systems of the company s important third parties are adversely affected could  in turn  affect the company s ability to communicate with third parties and could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company including but not limited to failures in service  disruptions in the company s ability to bill customers and pay suppliers and the possible slowdown of certain computer dependent processes 
the company has made inquiries of third party vendors  suppliers and customers  which have a material relationship with the company  as to the status of their year readiness 
to date  the company has not received sufficient responses from these third parties that would enable the company to assess the status of the third parties readiness for the year unreadiness by these third parties would expose the company to the potential for loss and impairment of business processes and activities 
the company is assessing these risks and is creating contingency plans intended to address perceived risks 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company expects to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause differences include  but are not limited to  the ability of other companies on which the company s systems rely to modify or convert their systems to be year ready  the ability of all third parties who have business relationships with the company to continue their businesses without interruption and similar uncertainties 
as a result  the company is in the process of evaluating possible internal and external scenarios that might have an adverse impact on the company 
the company also recognizes that a contingency plan must be developed in the event the company s systems cannot be made year compliant on a timely basis 
the company expects to complete the development of this contingency plan by july item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued new accounting standard in  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet quantified the impacts of adopting sfas no 
on its financial statements and has not determined the timing of or method of its adoption of sfas no 
however  sfas no 
could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income
