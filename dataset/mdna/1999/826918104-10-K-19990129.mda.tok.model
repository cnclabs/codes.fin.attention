the following discussion and analysis should be read in connection with the company s financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company derives revenues primarily through the sale of brand name eyeglass frames  including laura ashley eyewear  eddie bauer eyewear  and hart schaffner marx eyewear 
the company also has a division which distributes the company s own camelot brand as well as other brands and a division which sells brand name close outs at discounted prices 
since  the laura ashley eyewear collection has been the leading source of revenue for the company 
net sales of laura ashley eyewear accounted for   and of the company s net sales during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
in march  the company launched the eddie bauer eyewear collection  which accounted for of the company s fiscal year net sales although it was on the market for only eight months of that fiscal year 
while the company intends to continue reducing its dependence on the laura ashley eyewear line through the development of eddie bauer eyewear and other brand names and product offerings  the company expects the laura ashley eyewear line to continue to be one of the company s leading sources of revenue for the foreseeable future 
see factors that may affect future results substantial dependence upon laura ashley license 
the company s cost of sales consists primarily of payments to foreign contract manufacturers that produce frames to the company s specifications 
the complete development cycle for a new frame design typically takes approximately twelve months from the initial design concept to the release 
generally  at least six months are required to complete the initial manufacturing process 
in  the company recognized that it was dependent on frame manufacturers located in japan 
starting in  the company implemented a program to reduce that dependence by purchasing an increasing percentage of its frames from manufacturers located in other countries  particularly in hong kong china and to a lesser extent in italy and france 
the use of hong kong china manufacturers has also reduced the company s average frame cost  which has increased the company s gross margin 
in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s eyeglass frames were manufactured by companies in japan  and approximately   and  respectively  of the company s eyeglass frames were manufactured by companies headquartered in hong kong that have manufacturing facilities in china

effect of change in form from an s corporation to a c corporation the company was treated as an s corporation from through september  during the period the company was an s corporation  its income  whether or not distributed  was taxed for federal and state income tax purposes directly to the holders of the common stock  rather than to the company 
in addition  for california franchise tax purposes  s corporations were taxed at of taxable income in  and  net of income tax credits under the los angeles revitalization zone act 
the company paid dividends to its shareholders of   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
these dividends were paid to the shareholders to pay their income taxes and as a return of their investment 
no dividends were paid in fiscal since september   the company has been a c corporation  subject to federal and state corporate income taxes 
as a result of this conversion  the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

currently  the highest federal tax rate for c corporations is although the majority of the taxable income is taxed at and the corporate tax rate in california is 
the pro forma provision for income taxes in the statement of income data included elsewhere in this form k shows results as if the company had always been a c corporation 
financial accounting standards no 
requires the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under that method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in a company s financial statements or tax returns

net sales increased by from  for fiscal to  in fiscal and by to  in fiscal the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal resulted from a increase in net sales of laura ashley eyewear to  a increase in net sales of hart schaffner marx eyewear to  and a increase in net sales of jean nate eyewear to  the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal resulted from the launch of eddie bauer eyewear resulting in net sales of  for that line in fiscal those additional net sales were offset by a decrease in net sales of laura ashley eyewear to  a decrease in net sales of hart schaffner marx sales to  and an decrease in net sales of jean nate eyewear to  the increase in laura ashley eyewear net sales from fiscal to fiscal was due principally to an increase in unit sales and to a lesser extent to an increase in prices for selected frames 
the decrease in laura ashley eyewear net sales from fiscal to fiscal was due principally to optical market conditions  including increased competition  a decrease in the average price per frame  and to a lesser extent to a decrease in units sold 
the increase in net sales of hart schaffner marx eyewear and jean nate eyewear from fiscal to fiscal was due to an increase in unit sales 
the decrease in net sales of hart schaffner marx eyewear in fiscal was due principally to optical market conditions  including increased competition 
the decrease in net sales of jean nate eyewear in fiscal was due in large part to the company s decision not to pursue the renewal of the license  which expired september  gross profit 
gross profit was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal these increases in gross profit were attributable to increases in net sales as well as improvements in the gross margin  which increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and in fiscal during these years  the company utilized lower cost frame manufacturers for an increasing percentage of its frames  which has resulted in lower average frame costs 
this positive impact on gross margin was augmented in fiscal and fiscal due to beneficial currency fluctuations and by increases in the average selling price of frames 
gross margins in all three fiscal years were aided by continuing reductions in import duties and tariffs and favorable currency exchange 
gross margins remained constant in fiscal due to the company s ongoing policies regarding pricing and its maintenance of lower average frame costs 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal resulted predominantly from increased selling expenses 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from higher selling expenses commensurate with growth as well as the launch of the eddie bauer eyewear line in march selling expenses were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal  representing   and  respectively  of net sales for such periods 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal resulted from a  increase in in store display expenditures  due primarily to the introduction of new laura ashley eyewear store displays 
in addition  in fiscal  convention and trade show expenses increased by  royalty expense increased by  and sales salaries and commissions increased by  the increase from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from expenditures for in store displays for eddie bauer eyewear amounting to  an increase of  in expenditures in fiscal  for additional eyeglass cases given to certain independent optical retailers  an increase in royalty expenses of  a  increase in promotional expenses  due primarily to the introduction of the eddie bauer eyewear line  and a  increase in promotional expenses for laura ashley eyewear 
these increases were offset in part by a  decrease in expenditures for laura ashley eyewear in store displays 
general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal  representing   and  respectively  of net sales in these periods 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal resulted from a  increase in salaries  and a  increase in depreciation expense  offset in part by a decrease of  in employee bonuses  and a  decrease in stock compensation expenses 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal resulted in large part from a  increase in salaries and employee bonuses  due mostly to new employees hired during fiscal to accommodate the company s growth and continuing investment in its infrastructure 
other income expense  net 
other expense  net  consisted principally of interest expense in fiscal and fiscal interest expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal of  was predominantly due to the increase in borrowings through the bank s credit line as a result of i an increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher sales  ii a higher level of inventories that the company maintained to support higher sales levels and better customer service  iii capital expenditures relating to improvements of the company s facilities and the modernization of its computer equipment  and iv larger s corporation distributions 
other income  net  in fiscal was  due to the company s repayment of its bank financing in the fourth quarter of fiscal with the net proceeds of its september initial public offering  and the interest income resulting from the company investing a portion of those proceeds 
provisions for income taxes 
on a pro forma basis  income taxes unaudited would have amounted to  in fiscal and  in fiscal income taxes in fiscal were  net income 
pro forma net income unaudited was  in fiscal and  in fiscal net income in fiscal was  liquidity and capital resources at october   the company had  in cash or cash equivalents  of which  was invested in commercial paper with interest rates ranging from to  and  was invested in money market funds bearing interest at 
in october  the company entered into a credit agreement with its commercial bank the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  the bank has agreed to provide to the company an unsecured revolving line of credit up to an aggregate of  at the company s option  interest may be based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus or at the bank s prime rate 
at october   no amounts were due to the bank under the credit agreement 
of the company s accounts payable at october  and october    and  respectively  were payable in foreign currency 
to monitor risks associated with currency fluctuations  the company on a weekly basis assesses the volatility of certain foreign currencies and reviews the amounts and expected payment dates of its purchase orders and accounts payable in those currencies 
based on those factors  the company may from time to time mitigate some portion of that risk by purchasing forward commitments to deliver foreign currency to the company 
the company held forward commitments for foreign currencies in the amount of  at october  see note of notes to the financial statements 
the company s bad debt write offs were less than of net sales for the  and fiscal years 
as part of the company s management of its working capital  the company performs most customer credit functions internally  including extensions of credit and collections 
as of october   the company had repurchased on the open market  shares of its common stock at a cost of  under a stock buyback program initiated in september the program allows the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock from time to time on the open market at prevailing prices 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  borrowings under its credit facility  and credit from its suppliers will be sufficient to fund its working capital requirements at least through fiscal quarterly and seasonal fluctuations the company s results of operations have fluctuated from quarter to quarter and the company expects these fluctuations to continue in the future 
historically  the company s net sales in its first fiscal quarter the quarter ending january have been lower than net sales in other fiscal quarters 
the company attributes lower net sales in the first fiscal quarter in part to low consumer demand for prescription eyeglasses during the holiday season and year end inventory adjustments by distributors and independent optical retailers 
a factor which may significantly influence results of operations in a particular quarter is the introduction of a new brand name collection  which results in disproportionate levels of selling expenses due to additional advertising  promotions  catalogs and in store displays 
introduction of a new brand may also generate a temporary increase in sales due to initial stocking by retailers 
other factors which can influence the company s results of operations include customer demand  the mix of distribution channels through which the eyeglass frames are sold  the mix of eyeglass frames sold  product returns  delays in shipment and general economic conditions 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited results of operations for the twelve fiscal quarters ended october  the unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k and includes all normal recurring adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial data shown

year commencing  the company began a project to address the potential impact of the year problem on the processing of date sensitive information by the information technology systems used by the company and its key customers and vendors 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  certain computer programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than  which could cause miscalculations or system failures 
the objectives of the company s year project are to determine and assess the risks of the year problem and to plan and institute mitigating actions to minimize those risks to acceptable levels 
the company is not heavily dependent upon internally developed information technology systems 
the company s core operations systems are largely standard package systems for business management and inventory control  which have been developed by vendors whose products are widely used in the industry 
the company has already contacted its major information technology vendors and suppliers  and has obtained assurances that the technology is year compliant 
between now and its fiscal year end  the company will contact its remaining information technology vendors and suppliers as to their year compliance to determine what changes  if any  must be made to the information technology systems used by the company in its operations 
the company does not presently anticipate any material year issues or significant expenses from the conversion of its own information systems  databases or programs 
however  if the company s current estimates of the resources required to address and resolve year issues prove to be understated  the additional costs and resources required to address the year problem could result in a material financial risk 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the necessary systems and changes to address the year issues  and the company s inability to implement such systems and changes in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
because third party failures could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct business  the company will be sending questionnaires to substantially all of the company s key vendors and business partners  including manufacturers of the company s eyeglass frames and significant retailers of the company s products 
the purposes of these questionnaires are to obtain reasonable assurances about the year readiness status of these key vendors and business partners  and their plans to become year compliant 
the returned questionnaires will be assessed by the company  categorized based upon readiness for the year  and prioritized in order of significance to the business of the company 
to the extent that vendors and business partners do not provide the company with satisfactory evidence of their readiness to handle year issues  contingency plans will be developed 
at this time  the company does not know what measures its customers and vendors have taken to address the year problem or how that problem s effect on its customers and vendors will impact the company 
based on the company s current assessment  the costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  the failure by any of these key vendors or customers to adequately address the year problem could result in disruptions in the supply or sale of the company s products  either of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
factors that may affect future results the following is a discussion of certain factors that may affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
substantial dependence upon laura ashley license net sales of laura ashley eyewear accounted for   and of the company s net sales in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
in march  the company launched the eddie bauer eyewear collection  which accounted for of the company s fiscal year net sales although it was on the market for eight months of that fiscal year 
while the company intends to continue reducing its dependence on the laura ashley eyewear line through the development of eddie bauer eyewear and other brand names and product offerings  the company expects the laura ashley eyewear line to continue to be one of the company s leading sources of revenue for the foreseeable future 
the company manufactures laura ashley eyewear through an exclusive license with laura ashley entered into in the laura ashley license terminates in  but may be renewed by the company at least through january so long as the company is not in breach of the license agreement and meets certain minimum net sales requirements 
laura ashley may terminate the license before its term expires if i the company commits a material breach of the license agreement and fails to cure that breach within days after notice is given  ii the management or control of the company passes from bernard weiss and julie heldman to other parties whom laura ashley may reasonably regard as unsuitable  iii the company fails to propose a selection of styles of eyewear which laura ashley in exercising good faith is willing to approve for manufacture and distribution  iv the company fails to have net sales of laura ashley eyewear sufficient to generate minimum royalties in each of any two years  v the company is unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business or enters into liquidation  becomes bankrupt or insolvent  or is placed in the control of a receiver or trustee  or vi the company in any year fails to spend a specified percentage of net sales of laura ashley eyewear on advertising and promotion 
for purposes of renewal and early termination of the license agreement  the company must generate total laura ashley eyewear minimum net sales of   and  for the contract years ending january   and  respectively 
the company has substantially exceeded its minimum net sales requirements each year under the license agreement 
the termination of the laura ashley eyewear license would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
approval requirements of brand name licensors the company s business is predominantly based on its brand name licensing relationships 
in addition to its licensing relationship with laura ashley  the company licenses the right to use proprietary marks from eddie bauer and hart schaffner marx 
each of the laura ashley  eddie bauer and hart schaffner marx licenses requires mutual agreement of the parties for significant matters 
each of these licensors has final approval over all eyeglass frames and other products bearing the licensor s proprietary marks  and the frames must meet the licensor s general design specifications and quality standards 
consequently  each licensor may  in the exercise of its approval rights  delay the distribution of eyeglass frames bearing its proprietary marks 
the company expects that each future license it obtains will contain similar approval provisions 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to maintain good relationships with each licensor  or that the company will not be subject to delays resulting from disagreements with  or an inability to obtain approvals from  its licensors 
these delays could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
limitations on ability to distribute other brand name eyeglass frames each of the company s licenses limits the company s right to market and sell products with competing brand names 
the laura ashley license prohibits the company from selling any range of designer eyewear that is similar to laura ashley eyewear in price and any of style  market position and market segment 
the eddie bauer license prohibits the company from entering into license agreements with companies which eddie bauer believes are its direct competitors 
the hart schaffner marx license prohibits the company from marketing and selling another men s brand of eyeglass frames under a well known fashion name with a wholesale price in excess of the company expects that each future license it obtains will contain some limitations on competition within market segments 
the company s growth  therefore  will be limited to capitalizing on its existing licenses in the prescription eyeglass market  introducing eyeglass frames in other segments of the prescription eyeglass market  and manufacturing and distributing products other than prescription eyeglass frames such as sunglasses 
in addition  there can be no assurance that disagreements will not arise between the company and its licensors regarding whether certain brand name lines would be prohibited by their respective license agreements 
disagreements with licensors may adversely affect sales of the company s existing eyeglass frames or prevent the company from introducing new eyewear products in market segments the company believes are not being served by its existing products 
dependence upon contract manufacturers  foreign trade regulation the company s frames are manufactured to its specifications by a number of contract manufacturers located outside the united states  principally in japan  hong kong china  france and italy 
the manufacture of high quality metal frames is a labor intensive process which can require over production steps including a large number of quality control procedures and from to days of production time 
these long lead times increase the risk of overstocking  if the company overestimates the demand for a new style  or understocking  which can result in lost sales if the company underestimates demand for a new style 
while a number of contract manufacturers exist throughout the world  there can be no assurance that an interruption in the manufacture of the company s eyeglass frames will not occur 
an interruption occurring at one manufacturing site that requires the company to change to a different manufacturer could cause significant delays in the distribution of the styles affected 
this could cause the company to miss delivery schedules for these styles  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the purchase of goods manufactured in foreign countries is subject to a number of risks  including foreign exchange rate fluctuations  economic disruptions  transportation delays and interruptions  increases in tariffs and duties  changes in import and export controls and other changes in governmental policies 
for frames purchased other than from hong kong china manufacturers  the company pays for its frames in the currency of the country in which the manufacturer is located and thus the costs in united states dollars of the frames vary based upon currency fluctuations 
increases and decreases in costs in united states dollars resulting from currency fluctuations generally do not affect the price at which the company sells its frames  and thus currency fluctuations can impact the company s gross margin and results of operations 
in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal approximately   and respectively  of the company s eyeglass frames were manufactured by companies in japan  and approximately   and respectively  of the company s eyeglass frames were manufactured by companies headquartered in hong kong that have manufacturing facilities in china 
recent economic developments have resulted in a stronger us dollar and instability in the asian pacific economies and financial markets 
these economic developments have resulted in improved profit margins for the company  as its cost of goods has decreased for frames purchased in foreign currencies 
there can be no assurance  however  that the asian pacific economic instability will not result in an adverse future impact on the business operations of some of the company s contract manufacturers  which could force the company to move the manufacture of some styles to other factories 
the resulting disruption to the company s business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
effective july   the exercise of sovereignty over the british crown colony of hong kong was transferred from the united kingdom to china pursuant to a treaty between the two countries  and hong kong became a part of china 
any political or economic disruptions in hong kong or china may force the company to manufacture its eyeglass frames in other countries which could increase frame costs 
the company is uncertain as to the impact that the change in government will have on its business operations in hong kong 
further  china currently enjoys most favored nation trading status with the united states 
under the trade act of  the president of the united states is authorized  upon making specific findings  to waive certain restrictions that would render china ineligible for most favored nation treatment 
the president has waived these provisions every year since no assurance can be given that china will continue to enjoy most favored nation status in the future 
any legislation or administrative action by the united states government that revokes or places further conditions on china s most favored nation status  or otherwise limits imports of chinese eyeglass frames into the united states  could  if enacted  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
relationships with domestic distributors the company distributes its eyeglass frames to independent optical retailers in the united states other than california and arizona largely through distributors who sell competing lines of eyeglass frames 
the optical industry is undergoing a period of consolidation  and during fiscal and fiscal  three of the company s distributors were acquired by other companies 
although the company believes that its distributors currently devote a great deal of time and resources to promoting the company s products  there can be no assurance that these distributors will continue to do so 
the company does not have written agreements with its domestic distributors except for written understandings not to resell or divert laura ashley eyewear through unauthorized channels of distribution  and not to expand the territories in which they sell the company s products without the company s prior consent 
accordingly  the company s domestic distributors may spend an increased amount of effort and resources marketing competing products  and may terminate their relationships with the company at any time without penalty 
there can be no assurance that the informal nature of the company s relationships with its domestic distributors will not lead to disagreements between the company and its distributors or between the distributors themselves  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see business distribution 
international sales international sales accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal respectively 
these sales were primarily in england  canada  australia  new zealand  france and the netherlands 
the company s international business is subject to numerous risks  including the need to comply with export and import laws  changes in export or import controls  tariffs and other regulatory requirements  the imposition of governmental controls  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  the greater difficulty of administering business overseas and general economic conditions 
although the company s international sales are principally in united states dollars  sales to international customers may also be affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
product returns the company has a product return policy which it believes is standard in the optical industry 
under that policy  the company generally accepts returns of non discontinued product for credit  upon presentment and without charge 
according to the us optical industry handbook  the existence of this policy in the optical business has led to some companies having return rates as high as 
while the company s product returns for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal amounted to   and of gross sales sales before returns  respectively  and while the company maintains reserves for product returns which it considers adequate  the possibility exists that the company could experience returns at a rate significantly exceeding its historical levels  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
availability of vision correction alternatives the company s future success could depend to a significant extent on the availability and acceptance by the market of vision correction alternatives to prescription eyeglasses  such as contact lenses and refractive optical surgery 
while the company does not believe that contact lenses  refractive surgery or other vision correction alternatives materially and adversely impact its business at present  there can be no assurance that technological advances in  or reductions in the cost of  vision correction alternatives will not occur in the future  resulting in their more widespread use 
increased use of vision correction alternatives could result in decreased use of the company s eyewear products  which would have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
acceptance of eyeglass frames  unpredictability of discretionary consumer spending the company s success will depend to a significant extent on the market s acceptance of the company s brand name eyeglass frames 
if the company is unable to develop new  commercially successful styles to replace revenues from older styles in the later stages of their life cycles  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the company s future growth will depend in part upon the effectiveness of the company s marketing and sales efforts as well as the availability and acceptance of other competing eyeglass frames released into the market place at or near the same time  the availability of vision correction alternatives  general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors  all of which can change and cannot be predicted 
the company s success also will depend to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending  including the trend in managed health care to allocate fewer dollars to the purchase of eyeglass frames  and general economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment business conditions  interest rates and taxation 
any significant adverse change in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending generally  and purchasers of prescription eyeglass frames specifically  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition the markets for prescription eyewear are intensely competitive 
there are thousands of styles  including hundreds with brand names 
at retail  the company s eyewear styles compete with styles that do and do not have brand names  styles in the same price range  and styles with similar design concepts 
to obtain board space at an optical retailer  the company competes against many companies  both foreign and domestic  including luxottica group spa operating in the united states through a number of its subsidiaries  safilo group spa operating in the united states through a number of its subsidiaries and marchon eyewear  inc signature s largest competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales  manufacturing and other resources than the company 
they also employ direct sales forces that are significantly larger than the company s  and are thus able to realize a higher gross profit margin 
at the distributor level  sales representatives often carry many lines of eyewear  and the company must vie for their attention 
at the major retail chains  the company competes not only against other eyewear suppliers  but also against the chains themselves  which license some of their own brand names for design  manufacture and sale in their own stores 
luxottica  one of the largest eyewear companies in the world  is vertically integrated in that it manufactures frames  distributes them through direct sales forces in the united states and throughout the world  and owns lenscrafters  one of the largest united states retail optical chains 
the company competes in its target markets through the quality of the brand names it licenses  its marketing  merchandising and sales promotion programs  the popularity of its frame designs  the reputation of its styles for quality  and its pricing policies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially and adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s success has and will continue to depend to a significant extent upon its executive officers  including bernard weiss chief executive officer  julie heldman president  michael prince chief financial officer  robert fried senior vice president of marketing and robert zeichick vice president of advertising and sales promotion 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has entered into employment agreements with each of ms 
heldman and messrs 
weiss  prince  fried and zeichick  pursuant to which they have agreed to render services to the company until october  the company maintains and is the sole beneficiary of key person life insurance on ms 
heldman and messrs 
weiss  prince  fried and zeichick in the amount of  each 
in the event of the death of an executive officer  a portion of the proceeds of the applicable policy would be used to pay the company s obligation under the officer s employment agreement 
there can be no assurance that the remaining proceeds of these policies will be sufficient to offset the loss to the company due to the death of that executive officer 
in addition  the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract  retain and motivate personnel with a variety of creative  technical and managerial skills 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain and motivate its personnel or attract additional qualified members to its management staff 
the inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
management of growth the company has grown rapidly in recent years  with net sales increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and the number of employees increasing from approximately at october  to at october  the company s growth has placed substantial burdens on its management resources  and as a result of its growth  the company has made additions to its management team 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems and controls and to train  motivate and manage a larger number of employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain its historic rate of revenue growth  continue its profitable operations or manage future growth successfully 
control by directors and executive officers the directors and executive officers of the company own approximately of the company s outstanding shares 
as a result  the directors and executive officers control the company and its operations  including the approval of significant corporate transactions and the election of at least a majority of the company s board of directors and thus the policies of the company 
the voting power of the directors and executive officers could also serve to discourage potential acquirors from seeking to acquire control of the company through the purchase of the common stock  which might depress the price of the common stock 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations the company s results of operations have fluctuated from quarter to quarter and the company expects these fluctuations to continue in the future 
historically  the company s net sales in the quarter ending january its first quarter have been lower than net sales in other fiscal quarters 
the company attributes lower net sales in the first fiscal quarter in part to low consumer demand for prescription eyeglasses during the holiday season and year end inventory adjustments by distributors and independent optical retailers 
a factor which may significantly influence results of operations in a particular quarter is the introduction of a brand name collection  which results in disproportionate levels of selling expenses due to additional advertising  promotions  catalogs and in store displays 
introduction of a new brand may also generate a temporary increase in sales due to initial stocking by retailers 
other factors which can influence the company s results of operations include customer demand  the mix of distribution channels through which the eyeglass frames are sold  the mix of eyeglass frames sold  product returns  delays in shipment and general economic conditions 
no dividends anticipated the company does not currently intend to declare or pay any cash dividends and intends to retain earnings  if any  for the future operation and expansion of the company s business 
possible anti takeover effects the company s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to those of the common stock
