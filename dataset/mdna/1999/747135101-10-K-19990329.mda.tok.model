the company also produces a line of handcrafted sodas and operates restaurants adjacent to its two breweries  under the pyramid alehouse brand name 
the company produces and markets more than twenty ales and lagers under the pyramid and thomas kemper brands 
the company s two breweries  one in seattle  washington seattle brewery and one in berkeley  california berkeley brewery  had an estimated total annual production capacity of  barrels as of the end of the seattle brewery opened in march and has an estimated annual beer production capacity of  barrels 
the berkeley brewery was completed in february with an initial estimated annual beer production capacity of  barrels  and a maximum design capacity in excess of  barrels 
in march  pyramid added root beer and other premium sodas to its business when it acquired the assets of the thomas kemper soda company 
the company s breweries and restaurants were developed in accordance with its strategy of operating breweries in selected metropolitan areas serving regional markets 
the breweries produce high quality  full flavored beers in small batches using traditional brewing methods 
the company believes that the breweries and adjacent alehouses provide increased consumer awareness and loyalty for the company s brands by increasing opportunities for sampling and local product promotion 
craft beers are a small segment of the estimated billion dollar brewing industry 
the institute for brewing studies estimates that sales of craft beers increased by between one and two percent in and accounted for approximately of the total barrels of beer shipped by domestic brewers that year 
craft beers are distinguishable from mass produced beers by their wide range of fuller flavors and adherence to traditional european styles and ingredients 
the company has been successful in marketing wheat beers  which comprise one of the largest segments in the craft brewing industry 
the company has also successfully introduced fruit flavored beers to complement its more traditional ales and lagers 
pyramid hefeweizen  pyramid apricot ale and pyramid snowcap are the company s best selling ales 
under the thomas kemper brand  the company brews authentic german styles and also several adventurous styles popularized in other european countries 
thomas kemper weizenberry and thomas kemper hefeweizen are currently the company s best selling beers within the thomas kemper brand 
on march   the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of the thomas kemper soda company 
this acquisition supplemented the company s line of craft beers with thomas kemper soda s premium soft drinks including root beer and cream soda 
the company has since added an orange cream soda and a black cherry soda to the thomas kemper soda product line 
craft beers generally sell for retail prices ranging from to per six pack  retail prices are set independently by distributors and retailers 
the company s retail prices are usually at the high end of this range 
increased consumer demand for high quality  full flavored beers allows for a price premium relative to mass produced domestic beers 
this price premium results in higher profit margins  which motivate distributors and retailers to offer and promote craft beers 
the company s craft beers are sold primarily in washington  oregon and california  which accounted for approximately of the company s beer sales 
the company s alehouse and soda operations contributed and of net sales in  respectively 
business strategy the company s strategy has been to develop a network of company owned and operated breweries producing and marketing a wide selection of high quality  full flavored ales  lagers and sodas for regional markets 
adverse market conditions see competition  have caused the company to redirect its development efforts and refocus sales and marketing resources on its main west coast markets serviced by its existing breweries 
as market conditions improve  the company intends to continue its development efforts by i expansion in selected metropolitan areas by developing or acquiring additional breweries  ii producing a wide selection of craft beers under multiple brands  iii maintaining quality control of its beers by producing its beers in company operated breweries  iv promoting its products primarily through consumer sampling and education combined with targeted advertising  v distributing its beers through an independent network of wholesale distributors  and vi in appropriate locations  operating restaurants adjacent to the breweries to provide sampling for the full range of the company s beverage products 
expansion through regional breweries the company s strategy is to eventually develop a network of breweries in highly visible locations within selected metropolitan areas 
the company may develop or acquire additional breweries  and in appropriate locations  restaurants as demand for its craft beer brands grows 
the company s breweries and restaurants are focal points for marketing  creating brand awareness and generating sampling opportunities for the company s products 
the proximity of the company s breweries to their markets also optimizes product freshness  reduces freight costs and minimizes the inventory of kegs required to service draft accounts 
wide selection of craft beers under multiple brands the company produces a wide range of craft beers to appeal to a variety of discerning consumer tastes 
the company currently markets its products under two brands  pyramid and thomas kemper 
the pyramid brand accounted for of the company s beer sales in the company will also seek opportunities to develop or acquire other distinctive regional brands  similar to its existing thomas kemper brand  which may be unique to their local markets 
the multiple brand strategy  coupled with a wide range of styles  enables the company to obtain better market penetration through greater shelf space in bottled beer retail stores and additional tap handles in draft beer outlets 
production in company operated breweries the company brews all of its beers in company operated breweries providing direct control of the entire production process from purchase of ingredients to packaging and shipment 
the company believes this direct control provides strategic advantages over competitors who contract production of their products to other breweries 
the advantages of direct control over the production process include greater flexibility to innovate  the ability to cost effectively switch production of styles and packaging  greater control of product quality and freshness  better control over production costs and minimization of the risk that brewing capacity may be diverted to the products of other companies at short notice 
promotion based on local awareness and product sampling the company uses its breweries and restaurants to build brand awareness and generate opportunities for sampling of the company s products at their freshest 
the company s sales strategy emphasizes sales to the draft market to further provide sampling and awareness 
experience in the craft beer industry indicates that the local status of a brand is an important success factor 
the company s breweries and restaurants are extensively used to entertain the beer trade and build relationships with distributors 
the breweries and their highly knowledgeable employees are an important source of education and training for the company s distributors and retailers 
to further increase brand awareness and provide product sampling opportunities  the company uses event marketing  sponsorships  beer festivals and targeted charitable donations of its products 
the company has an award winning web site and an active public relations program 
the company also uses general media advertising targeted to certain markets and it advertises in craft beer publications 
independent distribution network the company distributes its products through a network of selected independent distributors rather than align itself with the distribution system of a single larger brewer 
this approach allows the company to select distributors in each market that it believes will focus the greatest attention on its products and best promote its high quality craft beers and sodas 
additionally  the ability to change distribution arrangements for performance related issues is an important advantage 
during  the company distributed its products in a total of states and canada 
restaurant operations the company operates restaurants adjacent to its seattle and berkeley breweries 
the two restaurants  which are operated under the pyramid alehouse brand name  provide opportunities for product sampling and increase brand awareness 
the restaurants contributed sales of  in  representing approximately of total net sales 
the restaurants have a total of over seats  plus outdoor eating areas  and are both situated in highly visible  high traffic locations 
the pyramid alehouse in seattle is close to the kingdome  currently home to the seattle seahawks football team and the seattle mariners baseball team 
a new mariners stadium  scheduled to open in july  is currently under construction immediately opposite the pyramid alehouse entrance and a new outdoor football stadium and exhibition center is scheduled to be constructed on the site of the existing kingdome 
the pyramid alehouse in berkeley is situated on one of the main arterials through the city and only seven blocks from interstate the berkeley outdoor cinema has been established in the alehouse parking lot 
the alehouses had approximately  guest visits during  guest purchases approximated million of the company s beers and sodas and more than  in branded clothing and other merchandise 
products the company produces over authentic  full flavored  european beer styles using traditional ingredients and brewing methods 
eight of these styles are available on a seasonal basis  and others are available only in certain geographical areas in accordance with the company s regional marketing strategy 
each unique beer style is brewed with malted barley and wheat grains  hops and  where appropriate  natural fruit extracts and spices 
the company avoids the use of less expensive ingredients in the belief that quality is supremely important success in the craft beer segment 
a similar philosophy is adopted with regard to the company s soda products 
each batch of soda is made from high quality ingredients  rather than from diluting mass produced syrups 
the sodas are characterized by much more pronounced flavors 
the company s beverages are not pasteurized and are currently distributed only in bottles and kegs 
competition competition within the craft beer and soda markets is based on product quality  taste  consistency  freshness  distribution  price  ability to differentiate products  promotional methods and other product support 
the number of competitors has increased dramatically in the past three years 
statistics from the institute of brewing studies indicate there were more than  craft brewers in the united states at the end of approximately two thirds of these brewers are brewpubs that sell all of their production at retail on the brewery premises 
the remaining brewers market their products through similar channels to those utilized by the company and  although many have limited geographic distribution  the result is significantly increased competition in all markets 
the company s past sales growth was achieved predominantly through increasing penetration in washington  oregon and california  which the company believes comprise one of the largest and most competitive craft beer markets in the united states  in terms of the number of specialty breweries and heightened consumer awareness of craft beer 
as this market has matured  the company has experienced intensified competition  increased seasonality and aggressive price promotions 
these market conditions will continue to adversely affect the company s operating margins 
as the company has expanded its distribution network outside washington  oregon and california  and as other craft brewers have expanded their distribution to these markets  the company has encountered and will continue to encounter increasing competition from other craft brewers 
although certain competitors distribute their products nationally and may have greater sales and financial resources than the company  the company believes that being a local supplier of high quality  traditionally brewed ales and lagers will differentiate the company s products and allow it to obtain good market share in those markets adjacent to its breweries 
the company also competes against producers of imported specialty beers 
although imported beers currently account for a much greater share of the us beer market than craft beers  the company believes that craft brewers have a number of competitive advantages over specialty beer imports  including lower transportation costs  no importation duties  proximity to and familiarity with local consumers  a higher degree of product freshness and eligibility for lower federal excise taxes 
in response to the rapid growth of the craft beer segment in prior years  all of the national domestic brewers have introduced full flavored beers 
the company expects that certain national brewers  with their greater financial resources  access to raw materials and their influence over their established national distribution networks  will seek further participation in the craft beer segment by introduction of more full flavored beers and through investments in  or the formation of distribution alliances with craft brewers 
the increasing participation of the national brewers will likely increase competition for market share and increase price competition within the craft beer segment 
the company believes that the national brewers participation may also increase consumer education and awareness of craft beers  and thus serve to further expand the existing market 
the company is aware that certain national brewing companies are using their considerable influence over their independent distributors to induce them to exclude competing products from their portfolios 
this has the effect of reducing the distribution options for the company s products 
while such actions have not at this time denied access to any market for the company s products  there can be no guarantee that this will not happen in the future 
item properties the company currently owns and operates two breweries  one in berkeley  california  and one in seattle  washington

the company currently sells its beverage products primarily in washington  oregon and california under the pyramid and thomas kemper brand names and operates two restaurants  under the pyramid alehouse name  each adjacent to its seattle  washington and berkeley  california breweries

in february of  the pyramid alehouse opened in berkeley 
total retail alehouse sales accounted for and of total net sales in and  respectively 
the company s sales volumes and selling prices are affected by several factors such as level of consumer demand in existing markets  sales in new distribution areas  availability of beer distributors in new and existing markets  and competitive factors  including the increase or decrease in the number of competing craft beers  new product introductions and promotional pricing 
during  management believes that the frequency of price promotions in the craft beer industry increased significantly 
sales in the craft beer industry generally reflect a significant degree of seasonality with the second and third calendar quarters reflecting stronger sales than in the first and fourth calendars quarters 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors and the company anticipates that its operating margin will fluctuate as a result of many factors  including i lower sales volumes due to changes in demand and lower selling prices due to increased product availability  ii increased depreciation and other fixed and semi fixed operating costs as a percent of sales during periods when the company s breweries are producing below capacity  iii sales seasonality and competition  iv increased raw material or packaging costs  and v changes in the sales mix 
increased selling and promotional costs incurred as the company protects its business in existing markets and develops its business in new geographic areas may also cause operating margins and operating income to decrease 
given increased competition and unfavorable market factors  the company has focused its marketing activities and resources on the western and southwestern markets 
in addition  the company s kalama brewery was closed in late and production was redistributed between the company s seattle and berkeley breweries to increase operating efficiency

borrowings under the line of credit will accrue interest  at the company s option  at either the bank s prime rate or at libor plus basis points 
up to  of the line of credit may be used to finance acquisitions 
amounts used to finance acquisitions may be converted to a four year fully amortizing term loan  with an additional option to fix the rate of interest at the bank s prime rate plus basis points 
future capital requirements may vary depending on such factors as the cost of acquisition of businesses  brands and real estate in the markets selected for future expansion 
capital expenditures through december  were approximately  which includes installation of soda equipment in the berkeley brewery  upgrading of brewery equipment and facilities in the seattle brewery and the installation of a new computer system 
while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review  the company believes that its cash reserves  together with cash from operations and borrowings under the line of credit  will be sufficient for the company s working capital needs 
the company s future cash requirements and cash flow expectations are closely related to its expansion plans 
the company generally expects to meet future financing needs through cash on hand  cash flow from operations and  to the extent required and available  additional bank borrowings 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if not addressed  the direct result could be a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process customer transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s year project is proceeding on schedule 
early in  the company began a project to improve its information systems by replacing existing business software 
the new system replaces all critical systems and approximately of all computer systems which the company s inventory showed to be affected by the year issue 
the company s inventory revealed no other significant problems arising from non compliant computer chips embedded in other equipment 
the total cost of the company s year project is approximately  including the cost of installing the business software 
approximately  has been incurred as of december  and the project is expected to be completed by mid the company is dependent upon certain suppliers and its wholesale customers 
there are plans to communicate with these companies to assess their readiness for the year contingency plans will be made where practicable to cope with interruption of supplies or services and failures by wholesalers to properly service the company s markets 
however  it should be noted that there are many cases  such as utility supply and servicing of remote markets  where no feasible alternatives are available to the company and the company is vulnerable to failures by external third parties 
although management anticipates that its systems and applications will be year compliant on a timely basis  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be year compliant in the same time frame 
any such failure on the part of other companies with whom the company transacts business  to be year compliant on a timely basis  may have an adverse impact on the operations of the company 
risk factors and forward looking statements pyramid breweries inc does not provide forecasts of future financial performance 
however this report does contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  which are subject to the safe harbor created by that section 
there are numerous important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made by the company 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty 
additional information concerning those and other factors is contained in the company s securities and exchange commission filings including its ipo prospectus 
increasing competition 
the domestic market in which the company s craft beers compete is highly competitive for many reasons  including the continuing proliferation of new craft brewers  new beers  and brew pubs  efforts by regional craft brewers to expand their production capacities and distribution  the introduction of fuller flavored products by certain major national brewers  and underutilized domestic brewing capacity  which facilitates expansion by existing contract brewers and the entry of new contract brewers 
the company anticipates that intensifying competition from craft beer and imported beer producers and increased capacity in the craft beer segment may adversely impact the company s operating margins 
in addition  the larger national brewers have developed or are developing brands to compete directly with craft beers 
these national competitors have advantages such as lower production costs  larger marketing budgets  greater financial and other resources and more developed and extensive distribution networks than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to grow its volumes or be able to maintain its selling prices in existing markets or as it enters new markets 
access to markets 
most of the company s independent distributors also are distributors of national brewers who are increasingly using their greater influence and marketing resources to persuade those distributors to exclude the products of other breweries from their portfolios 
such actions by national brewers have the effect of reducing distribution options for the company s products 
although the company has not yet experienced such an event  it is possible that the company could effectively be denied access to a market or markets by these tactics 
in the states which comprise the majority of its sales  the company has the option to distribute its products direct to retailers and the company has previous experience in doing so 
however  there is no assurance that self distribution can be done in an economic manner over large territories 
government regulations 
the company s business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels  and its brewery and restaurant operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where the company intends to do business could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to conduct its business 
certain states have laws restricting or forbidding a combined pub and brewery 
further  federal regulations prohibit  among other things  the payment of slotting allowances to retailers for beer products 
these regulations have the effect of preventing competitors with greater financial resources from excluding smaller brewers from retailers 
if these regulations were repealed or substantially modified  there would likely be a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
selling prices 
the future selling prices the company charges for its craft beer may decrease from historical levels due to increasing competitive pressures 
the company has and will continue to participate in price promotions with its wholesalers and their retail customers 
management believes that the number and frequency of the company s promotions will increase during variability of margins and operating results 
the company anticipates that its operating margins will fluctuate and may decline as a result of many factors  including i lower sales volumes and selling prices  ii increased depreciation and other fixed and semi fixed operating costs as a percent of sales during periods when the company s breweries are producing below designed capacity  iii increased raw material and packaging costs  iv changes in product mix and packaging  v increased transportation costs  vi increased sales from retail operations which have a lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales than beer sales  and vii increased selling and promotional costs incurred as the company protects its business in existing markets and develops business in new geographic markets 
increases in federal or state excise taxes and the impact of an increasing average federal excise tax rate as production increases may also cause a decline in the company s gross margins 
the company pays federal excise taxes on all beer sales and pays state excise taxes on beer sales occurring in various states at various tax rates 
the federal excise tax is per barrel on the first  barrels and per barrel exceeding  annually  as long as total annual sales are less than two million barrels 
the washington state excise tax is per barrel annually 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such an event  the market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 
impact of inflation although the company has not attempted to calculate the effect of inflation  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the company s results of operations 
in the future  increases in costs and expenses  particularly packaging  raw materials and labor costs may have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such cost increases cannot be passed along to its customers
