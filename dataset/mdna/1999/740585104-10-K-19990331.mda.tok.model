similarly  ebitda  before restructuring  merger costs and other special charges  acquired research and development and accrued settlement costs  grew from million to million over the same period  a compounded annual growth 
premiere has achieved growth in revenues and ebitda  before restructuring  merger costs and other special charges  acquired research and development and accrued settlement costs  by pursuing its mission to become the world s leading provider of innovative solutions to simplify everyday communications of both businesses and individuals 
during  and the company pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its service offerings and means of distribution 
significant acquisitions in included xpedite  a leading provider of electronic document distribution services  and ats  a full service provider of conferencing services 
in  the company acquired voice tel and voicecom 
the acquisition of voice tel provided premiere with the ability to offer voice messaging services on a local access basis over an international private network utilizing frame relay and internet protocols 
in connection with the acquisition of voicecom  premiere assumed a significant base of large corporate customers 
during  the company acquired telet  an enterprise engaged in computer telephony software development 
telet provided premiere with the foundation of its orchestrate suite of product offerings 
analysis premiere s financial statements reflect the results of operations of xpedite and ats from the date of their respective acquisition 
these acquisitions have been accounted under the purchase method of accounting 
premiere s financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the voice tel and voicecom acquisitions which have been accounted for as poolings of interests 
the following discussion and analysis is prepared on that basis 
consolidated revenues increased to million in and to million in revenues in the company s corporate enterprises solutions ces group increased from million in to million in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
revenue growth in this segment resulted principally from the acquisition of xpedite in february and ats in april and increases in the call center ivr services provided to bank of america formerly nationsbank 
revenue grew from million to million in the emerging enterprise solutions ees group over the same period  a compounded annual growth rate of 
revenue growth in this segment resulted mainly from strategic partner programs  including premiere s strategic alliance with mci worldcom and private label calling card programs with american express  deltatel and mbna  which experienced significant increases in new subscribers 
the company also experienced revenue increases from expanded enhanced calling services  including prepaid calling cards 
revenue growth in these ees group s programs were offset in part by revenues losses resulting from the bankruptcy of two wholesale enhanced calling services customers in the second quarter of  management s decision to discontinue certain unprofitable prepaid calling card programs and the expiration of revenue commitments provided under the company s strategic alliance agreement with mci worldcom 
revenues from the lost customers and discontinued programs set forth above contributed revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
consolidated gross profit margins were  and in  and  respectively 
gross profit margin declined in due to revenue mix resulting from the acquisition of xpedite in february gross profit margins for premiere s document distribution services are generally lower than that of premiere s other services 
gross profit margin improvement in was caused by revenue mix  as revenues from higher margin wholesale arrangements for certain enhanced calling services and local access voice and data messaging services constituted a greater proportion of revenues in as compared with generally  premiere has experienced favorable trends in per unit telecommunications costs in the three year period ended december  by aggressively leveraging increasing minute volumes to negotiate quantity discounts with telecommunications carriers 
such costs have also been favorably affected by general industry trends in which long distance transport and the cost of local access services have decreased as a result of increased capacity and competition among long distance and local exchange carriers 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of revenues in as compared with  was approximately million of costs recorded in the second quarter of such costs consist of approximately million of bad debt expense recorded in response to the bankruptcies of two customers  million of asset write offs and other costs 
the acquisition of ats in also contributed to an increase in selling  general and administrative costs in proportion to revenues because the service delivery processes of ats include relatively higher labor costs as compared with premiere s other services 
in addition  premiere aggressively expanded its management infrastructure in to more effectively support continued growth in its business 
these actions included hiring additional senior level managers and expanding its corporate headquarters facilities 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased in as compared with as premiere aggressively restructured the operations of its acquired businesses voice tel and voicecom subsequent to their acquisitions in these activities included substantially reducing the workforce  exiting duplicative facilities  eliminating redundant business activities and general spending reductions 
depreciation and amortization was million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in and million or of revenues in increases in depreciation and amortization in result mainly from depreciation and amortization of assets acquired in the purchases of xpedite and ats in and the acceleration of depreciation and amortization of certain other operating and intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the xpedite and ats acquisitions of approximately million is being amortized over to years 
in addition  amortization and depreciation of certain operating and intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately million at december  was accelerated effective in the fourth quarter of following a reduction in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
this action was based on a reassessment of the utility of such assets by premiere s management 
the affected assets consist of goodwill and other intangible assets and computer and telecommunications equipment associated with certain legacy technology systems the use of which will be discontinued in the forseeable future 
such assets will be amortized over lives ranging from to years effective in the fourth quarter of as compared with lives ranging from to years prior to the change 
in  management also evaluated the useful economic life of a strategic alliance intangible asset based on current facts and circumstances including the current level of revenues being generated by the strategic alliance 
in connection with this evaluation  the carrying value of this asset was reduced by a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of the amortization period of the remaining carrying value of this asset was reduced to years effective in the fourth quarter of which compares with an estimated remaining useful life of years prior to the change 
incremental depreciation and amortization expense recorded in as compared with resulting from assets acquired in the xpedite and ats acquisitions and acceleration of depreciation and amortization of the operating and intangible assets set forth above approximates million 
increased depreciation and amortization expense in as compared with results mainly from depreciation associated with increased purchases of computer telephony equipment to support new business growth  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in connection with the voice tel acquisitions in and amortization of the strategic alliance asset recorded in see not strategic alliances and investments 
net interest expense increased to million in  from 
million in and million in net interest expense increased in mainly due to interest associated with million of debt assumed in the acquisition of xpedite in february and million of debt assumed in the acquisition of ats in april substantially all of the debt assumed in the acquisition of xpedite was associated with a short term revolving loan facility maintained by xpedite 
in december  premiere amended and restated this facility for a one year period 
the amount outstanding under this loan facility at december  was million 
borrowings assumed in the acquisition of ats consisted principally of term notes secured by operating equipment purchased with the proceeds of the loans 
these terms loans were repaid in full by premiere in also contributing to the increase in net interest expense in was the reduction in cash and marketable securities balances to fund operations and other strategic initiatives thereby lowering interest income 
net interest expense in resulted mainly from indebtedness assumed in the voice tel acquisitions in and the voicecom acquisition in september the majority of these obligations were repaid subsequent to the acquisitions 
restructuring  merger costs and other special charges incurred in were million compared to million in see note restructuring  merger costs and other special charges and note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements and restructuring  merger costs and other special charges which follows for a description of these costs 
accrued settlement costs were million in and and million in see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and legal proceedings under item of part ii of this document for further information about the matters giving rise to these accruals 
acquired research and development costs of million expensed in are associated with the acquisition of xpedite 
approximately million of acquired research and development costs were expensed in connection with the telet acquisition in these costs represent the value assigned to research and development projects in the developmental stage which had not reached technological feasibility at the date of the acquisition or had no alternative future use 
the valuation of these costs was based on independent appraisals 
see note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in  premiere s effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of nondeductible goodwill amortization associated with premiere s acquisitions which have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in and  premiere s effective tax rate varied from the statutory rate due to certain non taxable investment income and income of voice tel entities which had elected to be treated as s corporations under us tax law prior to their acquisition by the company 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its growth through cash generated by operations  by issuing subordinated convertible indebtedness in july and from the proceeds of its initial public offering in march cash provided by operations was million in  million in and million in excluding payments made for restructuring  merger costs  accrued settlement costs and other special charges  cash provided by operations was million in  million in and million in operating cash flow declined on higher revenues in primarily as a result of revenue losses in premiere s ees group and continued investment by the company to expand its management infrastructure to support continued growth 
improvement in operating cash flows in as compared with results principally from premiere s integration and cost reduction initiatives associated with the voice tel and voicecom acquisitions in which reduced the operating costs of these businesses 
premiere s working capital ratio was 
to at december  as compared with to at december  decline in working capital resulted principally from borrowings of approximately million outstanding at december  under the revolving loan facility assumed by premiere in the xpedite acquisition 
in addition  premiere liquidated approximately million of short term investment balances in to fund operating and strategic initiatives 
xpedite s revolving loan facility was extended under a one year arrangement effective december  accordingly  such borrowings are classified as a current liability 
if borrowings under this facility were excluded from current liabilities  premiere s current ratio would have been to at december  investing activities provided cash of approximately million in and used cash of approximately million and in and  respectively 
the principal source of cash from investing activities in was the liquidation of approximately million of short term investments to fund various operating and strategic initiatives 
premiere made capital expenditures of million in significant capital programs in included construction costs and equipment purchases associated with the company s network expansion program  development costs incurred in connection with the company s introduction of internet enabled communications services and operating infrastructure expansion in support of new business growth 
premiere paid approximately million to fund acquisition activity in premiere paid cash of approximately million to acquire ats in april shareholders of ats also received approximately  shares of premiere common stock in connection with the acquisition 
remaining cash paid for acquisitions in is associated with payment of transaction related costs incurred in acquiring xpedite and three individually insignificant acquisitions including two document distribution businesses located in germany and singapore and a company engaged in marketing long distance calling cards to college students in the united states 
the company made investments of approximately million in to acquire initial or increase existing equity interests in various companies engaged in emerging technologies  such as the internet 
premiere s investments include minority equity investments in webmd  a leading full service internet healthcare web site  usa 
net  a leading electronic messaging company  intellivoice  an entity engaged in developing voice activation and other technologies  verticalone  a network based services provider that increases frequency  duration  and quality of visits to customers web sites  and webforia  a provider of web services  tools and communities that assist individuals in the process of researching  organizing and presenting high quality information from the internet 
management intends to continue to make such investments in the future in complementary businesses and other initiatives that further its strategic business plan 
significant investing activities in and included investment of proceeds associated with premiere s million convertible subordinated debt issuance in and its initial public offering which raised net proceeds of approximately million in premiere made capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment  mainly computer and telecommunications equipment  of approximately million in and million in these expenditures were made primarily to expand operational infrastructure to support new business growth 
management anticipates that these expenditures will continue to increase in the future as the company upgrades and expands the operational infrastructure of both its existing computer telephony network and integrates the networks of its acquired companies 
in addition  the company paid approximately million of cash in connection with the voice tel acquisitions in and million in the acquisition of telet in see also note acquisitions in notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective december   premiere amended and restated the revolving loan facility it assumed in connection with the xpedite acquisition for a period of one year 
this arrangement provides for borrowings of up to million and contains certain covenants which require the company to maintain minimum earnings and interest coverage ratios and achieve certain revenue levels  in addition to other covenants 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  continued compliance under these loan covenants will require that premiere attain certain revenue and earnings growth rates or reduce indebtedness in order to satisfy the minimum ratio requirements required under this arrangement 
at december   the company had unused borrowing capacity of approximately million under this arrangement 
premiere used cash of approximately million in in financing activities 
significant cash outflows for financing activities included repayment of approximately million of indebtedness mainly in connection with the company s revolving loan facility extension 
in addition  premiere executed a stock repurchase program in under which the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock for approximately million 
the company s principal financing activities in and consisted of the issuance of convertible subordinated notes of million in and its initial public offering which yielded net proceeds of million in premiere also repaid approximately million of indebtedness in assumed in connection with the voice tel and voicecom acquisitions 
cash distributions to shareholders of voicecom and certain voice tel companies  primarily s corporations  used million and million in and  respectively 
such distributions were made in periods prior to the voice tel and voicecom acquisitions and were made primarily to reimburse s corporation shareholders for taxes paid on the proportionate share of taxable income of such companies they were required to report in their individual income tax returns 
at december   the company s principal commitments involve indebtedness under its revolving loan facility which matures december   lease obligations and minimum purchase requirements under supply agreements with telecommunications providers 
the company is in compliance under all such agreements at this date 
see also note indebtedness and note contingencies and commitments in notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that cash and marketable securities on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the company s revolving loan facility should be sufficient to fund growth in the company s businesses in premiere s revolving loan arrangement matures on december  and the company will be required to repay or refinance this indebtedness at that time 
management regularly reviews the company s capital structure and evaluates potential alternatives in light of current conditions in the capital markets 
depending upon conditions in these markets and other factors  the company may  from time to time  engage in capital transactions  including debt or equity issuances  in order to increase the company s financial flexibility and meet other capital needs 
restructuring  merger costs and other special charges premiere recorded restructuring  merger costs and other special charges of approximately million in such amount is comprised of approximately million of costs recorded in the first quarter of representing the estimated costs to restructure certain operating activities of premiere and xpedite subsequent to their merger 
such costs consist of severance associated with workforce reduction  lease termination costs  costs to terminate certain contractual obligations and asset impairments 
in the fourth quarter of  premiere recorded a million charge to write down the value of its mci worldcom strategic alliance intangible asset 
this charge was required based upon management s assessment of current facts and circumstances within guidelines mandated by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in addition  premiere recorded a charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of its investment in certain equity securities of digitec to fair market value 
this charge was necessitated based upon management s assessment that the decline in value of these securities was not temporary 
these charges were offset in part by a reduction in restructuring reserves of approximately million 
the reduction in reserves was necessary to eliminate remaining accruals associated with programs that have been completed and to reflect subsequent changes to management s restructuring plans rendering the accrual of certain costs unnecessary 
in connection with the voicecom acquisition  the company recorded restructuring  merger costs and other special charges of approximately million in the third quarter of such amounts consisted of transaction costs  asset impairments  costs to terminate or restructure certain contractual obligations and other costs 
transaction costs associated with the voicecom acquisition were expensed as required by the pooling of interests method of accounting 
other restructuring and special charges recorded in the third quarter result principally from management s plan to restructure voicecom s operations by reducing its workforce  exiting certain facilities  discontinuing duplicative product offerings and terminating or restructuring certain contractual obligations 
the company recorded approximately million of restructuring  merger costs and other special charges in the second quarter of in connection with the voice tel acquisitions 
those charges result from management s plan to restructure the operations of the voice tel businesses under a consolidated business group model and discontinue its franchise operations 
this initiative involves substantial reduction in the administrative workforce  abandoning duplicative facilities and assets and other costs necessary to discontinue redundant business activities

sop requires costs of start up activities and organizational costs  as defined to be expensed as incurred 
the company expects no material adverse effect to its financial position upon adoption of sop or sop factors affecting future performance the successful integration and consolidation of acquired businesses  products and services into our operations are essential to our future performance 
we are in the process of continuing to integrate several businesses acquired in and by attempting to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary costs and to operate them under common management 
there can be no assurance that the acquired businesses will be successfully integrated with our operations on schedule or at all  that the acquisitions of these businesses will result in sufficient net sales or earnings to justify our investment in these acquisitions or the expenses related thereto  or that operational synergies will develop 
the successful integration of the acquired businesses into our operations is critical to our future performance 
failure to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or to achieve operating synergies would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential challenges to the successful integration of acquired businesses include  but are not limited to 
centralization and consolidation of financial  operational and administrative functions  
consolidation of service centers  networks and work forces  
elimination of unnecessary costs  and 
realization of economies of scale 
we are continuing to integrate and consolidate previously acquired service offerings  operations and systems with ours  and therefore  our integration plans may materially change in the future 
challenges to the successful integration of acquired service offerings  operations and systems include  but are not limited to 
localization of our products and services  
integration of platforms and networks  
cross selling of products and services to our customer base and customer bases of acquired businesses  
integration and retention of new personnel  and 
compliance with regulatory requirements 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully due to increased competition and the development of alternatives to our services 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive  quickly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than we do 
we believe that our current competitors are likely to expand their product and service offerings and that new competitors are likely to enter the company s markets  and such competitors may to attempt to integrate their products and services  resulting in greater competition 
our corporate messaging and voice and data messaging services compete with voice mail services provided by at t  certain regional bell operating companies rbocs and other service bureaus as well as by equipment manufacturers  such as octel communications corporation which is owned by lucent technologies  northern telecom  siemens business communications systems  centigram communications  boston technology  and digital sound 
our interactive voice response services compete with ivr services provided by at t  mci  worldcom  lucent  west teleservices  call interactive and syntellect 
our conferencing services compete with conference calling services provided by at t  mci worldcom  sprint  as well as numerous smaller regional competitors 
our enhanced travel  concierge  news and e mail services compete with services provided by america online  prodigy and numerous internet service providers 
our orchestrate r service competes with unified communications products offered by companies such as octel lucent  microsoft  novell  sun microsystems  motorola  and numerous smaller entities  such as jfax general magic and webley systems 
for example  octel and microsoft have announced a service  called unified messenger  which places all voice mail  e mail and fax messages in a single mailbox accessible by computer or telephone 
sun microsystems and lucent have announced an alliance to build products that tie together voice mail  e mail  telephone and fax communications 
motorola and general magic have announced similar products 
our enhanced calling services and premiere worldlink corporate card compete with services provided by companies such as at t  mci worldcom and sprint  as well as smaller interexchange long distance providers 
our document distribution services compete with services provided by at t  mci worldcom and sprint  and many of the international postal  telephone and telegraph ptt companies located around the world  as well as numerous smaller regional competitors 
we cannot predict whether at t  mci worldcom  sprint  any internet service provider or ptt or any other competitor will expand its electronic document distribution business  and there can be no assurance that these or other competitors will not commence or expand their businesses 
moreover  our receiving  queuing  routing and other systems logic and architecture are not proprietary  and as a result  there can be no assurance that such information will not be acquired or duplicated by existing and potential competitors 
we do not typically have long term contractual agreements with our customers  and there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to transact business with us in the future 
in addition  even if there is continued growth in the use of electronic document distribution services  there can be no assurance that potential customers will not elect to use their own equipment to fulfill their needs for electronic document distribution services 
there also can be no assurance that customers will not elect to use alternatives to our document distribution services  including the internet  to carry their communications or that companies offering such alternatives will not develop product features or pricing which are more attractive to customers than those currently offered by us 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely effect our business 
in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes to the public on june and july   we incurred million in indebtedness 
effective december   we amended and restated the revolving loan facility we assumed in connection with the xpedite acquisition for a period of one year 
this arrangement provides for borrowings of up to million and contains certain covenants which require us to maintain minimum earnings and interest coverage ratios and achieve certain revenue levels  in addition to other covenants 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  we will have to attain certain revenue and earnings growth rates or reduce indebtedness in order to satisfy the minimum ratio requirements required under this arrangement in the future 
at december  the company had unused borrowing capacity of approximately million under this arrangement 
our loan facility limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness  grant liens  pay dividends or distributions  make certain acquisitions for cash  sell assets and repurchase our securities 
as a result of this increased leverage  our principal and interest obligations increased substantially 
the degree to which we are leveraged and the restrictions contained in the loan facility could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
our increased leverage could also adversely affect our liquidity  as a substantial portion of available cash from operations may have to be applied to meet debt service requirements  and in the event of a cash shortfall  we could be forced to reduce other expenditures and forego potential acquisitions to be able to meet such requirements 
the indenture related to our convertible notes does not contain any financial covenants or any other agreements restricting the payments of dividends  the repurchase of our securities  the issuance of additional equity or the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the telecommunications act of may increase competition 
furthermore  on february   president clinton signed into law the telecommunications act of the act  which allows local exchange carriers lecs  including the rbocs  to immediately provide long distance telephone service between local access and transport areas latas outside of their local service territories 
the legislation also grants the federal communications commission the fcc the authority to deregulate other aspects of the telecommunications industry  which in the future may  if authorized by the fcc  facilitate the offering of an integrated suite of information and telecommunications services by the rbocs in competition with us 
this increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate advances in technologies 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate industry standards  continue to apply advances in technologies  enhance our current services  develop and introduce new products and services in a timely fashion  enhance our software and our platforms and compete successfully with products and services based on evolving or new technologies 
we expect new products and services  and enhancements to existing products and services  to be developed and introduced which will compete with our products and services 
our orchestrate r product line is expected to compete within markets where larger companies are working to provide a unified communications solution 
technological advances may result in the availability of new services  products or methods of electronic document distribution that could compete with the electronic document distribution services currently provided by us or decrease the cost of existing products or services which could enable our established or potential customers to meet their own needs for electronic document distribution services more cost efficiently than through the use of our services 
the acquisitions of the voice tel entities in constituted a significant investment by us in a private frame relay network architecture 
alternative architectures currently exist  and technological advances may result in the development of additional network architectures 
there can be no assurance that the telecommunications industry will not standardize on a protocol other than frame relay or that our frame relay architecture will not become obsolete 
such events would require us to invest significant capital in upgrading or replacing our private frame relay network and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may experience difficulty integrating incompatible systems of acquired businesses into our networks 
there can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected in the event of such technological change or difficulty  or that changes in technology will not enable additional companies to offer services which could replace  or be more cost effective than  some or all of the services we now offer 
our future success will depend on market acceptance of new products and services that we develop 
we must continually introduce new products and services in response to technological changes  evolving industry standards and customer demands for enhancements to our existing products and services 
one such product is orchestrate r 
delays in the introduction of new products and services  our inability to develop such new products and services or the failure of such products and services to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that 
we will successfully develop and market new products and services or product and service enhancements that respond to these or other technological changes  evolving industry standards or customer demands  
we will develop effective marketing  pricing and distribution strategies for new products and services  including orchestrate  
we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  or 
our new products and services  including orchestrate r  and enhancements to our existing products and services  will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
managing our growth through acquisitions may strain our administrative  technical and financial resources 
we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and  as a result  frequently engage in acquisition discussions  conduct due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions  and  where appropriate  engage in acquisition negotiations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets 
in addition  we compete for acquisitions and expansion opportunities with companies that have substantially greater resources 
we have experienced substantial growth in revenue and personnel in recent years  particularly in and early a substantial portion of such growth has been accomplished through acquisitions  including the acquisitions of voice tel and its affiliate voice tel network limited partnership vtn and substantially all of voice tel s franchisees the franchisees voice tel  vtn and the franchisees are collectively referred to as the voice tel entities and such acquisitions are referred to collectively as the voice tel acquisitions  the acquisition of voicecom  the merger with xpedite and the acquisition of american teleconferencing services 
our growth has placed significant demands on all aspects of our business  including our administrative  technical and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion may further strain our management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space are or will be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
our future operating results will substantially depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our administrative  technical and financial control and reporting systems 
if we are unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions  then the quality of our services  our ability to attract and retain key personnel and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
at certain stages of growth in network usage  we will be required to add capacity to our platforms and our digital central office switches and we will need to continually add capacity to our private frame relay network  thus requiring that we continuously attempt to predict growth in its network usage and add capacity accordingly 
difficulties in managing continued growth  including difficulties in predicting the growth in our network usage  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions also involve numerous additional risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
assimilation and retention of the key employees of an acquired company are generally important to the success of an acquisition and the failure to assimilate and retain any such key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions may decrease our shareholders percentage ownership and require us to incur additional debt 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets reflected on our financial statements as a result of acquisitions 
we are amortizing the goodwill and other intangibles over a range of periods we believe appropriate for the assets 
if the amortization period is accelerated due to a reevaluation of the useful life of these assets or otherwise  amortization expense may initially increase on a quarterly basis or require a write down of the goodwill or other intangible assets 
an increase in the rate of amortization of goodwill or future write downs and restructuring charges could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions may involve restructuring and other special charges 
we have taken  and in the future may take  charges in connection with acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the costs and expenses incurred will not exceed the estimates upon which such charges are based 
during the second quarter of  we took a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the acquisitions of the voice tel entities 
during the third quarter of  we took a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of voicecom 
we also recorded restructuring and other special charges before income taxes of approximately million in connection with the merger with xpedite 
long distance pricing pressures could adversely effect our business 
telecommunications companies compete for consumers based on price  with major long distance carriers conducting extensive advertising campaigns to capture market share 
there can be no assurance that a decrease in the rates charged for communications services by the major long distance carriers or other competitors  whether caused by general competitive pressures or the entry of the rbocs and other lecs into the long distance market  would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we need to retain the services of our key management and personnel 
our success is largely dependent upon its executive officers and other key personnel  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on our performance 
we believe that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of boland t 
jones  chairman and chief executive officer  and certain other key executives 
mr 
jones has entered into an employment agreement which expires in december  and we maintain key man life insurance on mr 
jones in the amount of million 
we need to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel 
we also believe that to be successful we must hire and retain highly qualified engineering and product development personnel 
competition in the recruitment of highly qualified personnel in the information and telecommunications services industry is intense 
if we are not able to locate  hire and retain such personnel it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be able to attract qualified personnel in the future 
we do not typically have longterm contractual agreements with our customers 
we expect that the information and telecommunications services markets will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies  possibly including alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost effective than our technologies 
we do not typically have long term contractual agreements with our customers  and there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to transact business with us in the future 
we rely on amway and certain other clients for significant revenues 
we have historically relied on sales through amway corporation for a substantial portion of our revenue 
such sales accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for  and  respectively 
total revenues from amway have decreased significantly over the last two fiscal years but amway remains a significant customer 
there can be no assurance that our relationship with amway and the amway distributors will continue at historical levels or at all  nor can there be any assurance of long term price protection for services provided to amway 
continued loss in total revenues from amway or diminution in the amway relationship  or a decrease in average sales price without an offsetting increase in volume  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have entered into a service and reseller agreement with amway the amway agreement providing  among other things  for the sale of voice messaging and network transmission services on an exclusive basis to amway in the united states  canada  new zealand and australia for resale by amway to its independent distributors 
the amway agreement does not bind the amway distributors  who are free to acquire messaging services from alternative vendors 
the amway agreement may be canceled by either party upon days prior written notice or upon shorter notice in the event of a breach 
the amway agreement does not prohibit us from continuing to provide voice messaging and network transmission services to amway s distributors following termination of the amway agreement 
however  in the event that amway recommended a voice messaging and network transmission services provider other than ours  there can be no assurance that amway s distributors would not follow such recommendation 
amway has sold substantially all of the common stock of premiere that it acquired in the voice tel acquisitions 
the sale of such stock may increase the possibility that amway will recommend a voice messaging and network transmission services provider other than us 
financial difficulties of licensees or strategic partners could adversely impact our earnings 
the telecommunications industry is intensely competitive and rapidly consolidating 
the majority of companies that have chosen to outsource communications card services to us are small or medium sized telecommunications companies that may be unable to withstand the intense competition in the telecommunications industry 
during the second quarter of  a licensing customer and a strategic partner in our enhanced calling services group initiated proceedings under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
we recorded approximately million of charges in the second quarter of associated with uncollectible accounts receivable  primarily related to these financially distressed customers 
the financial difficulties of these two customers  as well as revenue shortfalls in the voice and data messaging group and other unanticipated costs and one time charges  contributed to an after tax loss for the second quarter of there can be no assurance that one or more additional failures will not occur  and any such additional failures could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success depends on the success of our strategic relationships 
a principal element of our strategy is the creation and maintenance of strategic relationships that will enable us to offer our services to a larger customer base than we could otherwise reach through our direct marketing efforts 
failure of one or more of our strategic partners to successfully develop and sustain a market for our services  or the termination of one or more of our relationships with a strategic partner  could have a material adverse effect on our overall performance 
we experienced growth in our existing strategic relationships during  and and entered into or initiated new strategic relationships with several companies  including mci worldcom  webmd  usa 
net  intellivoice  and webforia 
although we intend to continue to expand our direct marketing channels  we believe that strategic partner relationships may offer a potentially more effective and efficient marketing channel 
consequently  our success depends in part on the ultimate success of these relationships and on the ability of these strategic partners to market our services effectively 
in connection with our strategic plan  we make investments and form alliances with companies involved in emerging technologies  such as the internet  as well as marketing alliances and outsourcing programs designed to reduce costs and develop new markets and distribution channels for our products 
in  the company made investments of approximately million to acquire initial or increase existing equity interests in companies engaged in emerging technologies 
since many of the companies in which we make investments are small  early stage companies  our investments are subject to the significant risks faced by these companies which could result in the loss of our investment 
in  the company took a net charge of million reflecting the write down of an equity investment in a telecommunications distribution partner  digitec 
in november  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with worldcom  now known as mci worldcom  whereby mci worldcom is required  among other things  to provide us with the right of first opportunity to provide certain enhanced computer telephony services for a period of at least years 
in connection with this agreement  we issued to mci worldcom  shares of common stock valued at approximately million based on an independent appraisal and paid mci worldcom million in cash 
we recorded the value of this agreement as an intangible asset 
subsequent to entering into this strategic alliance agreement worldcom completed a merger with mci to form mci worldcom 
mci was a competitor of ours with respect to certain services and the total impact of the merger between mci and worldcom on our strategic alliance with mci worldcom cannot be determined at this time 
current activity levels under the strategic alliance agreement are significantly below the specified minimum payment levels in the agreement and the minimum payments ceased at the end of september we periodically review this intangible asset for impairment and in we wrote down the carrying value of the mci worldcom strategic alliance intangible asset by approximately million 
in addition  we accelerated amortization of the remaining carrying value of the asset starting in the fourth quarter of by shortening its estimated remaining useful life to three years from years 
although we view our strategic relationships as a key factor in our overall business strategy and in the development and commercialization of our services  there can be no assurance that our strategic partners view their relationships with us as significant for their own businesses or that they will not reassess their commitment to us in the future 
our arrangements with our strategic partners do not always establish minimum performance requirements for our strategic partners  but instead rely on the voluntary efforts of these partners in pursuing joint goals 
certain of these arrangements prevent us from entering into strategic relationships with other companies in the same industry as our strategic partners  either for specified periods of time or while the arrangements remain in force 
in addition  even when we are without contractual restriction  we may be restrained by business considerations from pursuing alternative arrangements 
the ability of our strategic partners to incorporate our services into successful commercial ventures will require us  among other things  to continue to successfully enhance our existing products and services and develop new products and services 
our inability to meet the requirements of our strategic partners or to comply with the terms of our strategic partner arrangements could result in our strategic partners failing to market our services  seeking alternative providers of communications and information services or canceling their contracts with us  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on our ability to establish and maintain licensing and wholesale relationships 
we have licensing and wholesale relationships with companies that have chosen to outsource part or all of their communications card services 
license fees accounted for approximately and of our revenues in and  respectively 
mci worldcom accounted for approximately of our license fees and of our total revenues  and approximately of our license fees and of our total revenues in although we intend to increase our number of licensees and our licensee transaction volume in the future  our success depends in part upon the ultimate success or failure of our licensees and our ability to establish and maintain licensing and strategic relationships 
the telecommunications industry is intensely competitive and rapidly consolidating 
the majority of companies that have chosen to outsource communications card services to us are small or medium sized telecommunications companies that may be unable to withstand the intense competition in the telecommunications industry 
during the second quarter of  a licensing customer and a strategic partner in our enhanced calling services group initiated proceedings under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
we recorded approximately million of charges in the second quarter of associated with uncollectible accounts receivable  primarily related to these financially distressed customers 
there can be no assurance that one or more additional failures will not occur or that the failure of one or more of our licensees to develop and sustain a market for our services  or termination of one or more of our licensing or strategic relationships  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
consolidation in the telecommunications industry could adversely effect our business 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing rapid consolidation 
for example  in worldcom  a strategic partner of the company  completed a merger with mci communications corp  a competitor of ours with respect to certain services  to form mci worldcom 
consolidation in the communications industry  including consolidations involving the company s customers  competitors and strategic partners  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success depends on market acceptance of computer telephony 
our future success depends upon the market acceptance of our existing and future computer telephony product lines and services 
computer telephony integrates the functionality of telephones and computers and thus represents a departure from standards for information and telecommunications services 
market acceptance of computer telephony products and services generally requires that individuals and enterprises accept a new way of exchanging information 
a decline in the demand for  or the failure to achieve broad market acceptance of  our computer telephony product lines and services would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that broad market acceptance of our computer telephony product lines and services will depend on several factors  including ease of use  price  reliability  access and quality of service  system security  product functionality and the effectiveness of strategic marketing and distribution relationships 
there can be no assurance that our computer telephony products and services will achieve broad market acceptance or that such market acceptance will occur at the rate which we currently anticipate 
downtime in our platforms networks could result in the loss of significant customers 
we currently maintain switching facilities and computer telephony platforms in approximately locations 
our network service operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the equipment and data at our switching facilities against damage that may be caused by fire  power loss  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and other similar events 
we have taken precautions to protect ourselves and our customers from events that could interrupt delivery of our services 
these precautions include physical security systems  uninterruptible power supplies  on site power generators  upgraded backup hardware  fire protection systems and other contingency plans 
in addition  certain of our networks are designed such that the data on each network server is duplicated on a separate network server 
notwithstanding such precautions  we have experienced downtime in our networks from time to time and there can be no assurance that downtime will not occur in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that a fire  act of sabotage  technical failure  natural disaster or a similar event would not cause the failure of a network server and its backup server  other portions of our networks or one of the switching facilities as a whole  thereby resulting in an interruption of the our services 
such interruptions could result in the loss of significant customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we maintain business interruption insurance providing for aggregate coverage of approximately million per policy year  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our business interruption insurance  that such insurance will continue to be available at reasonable prices or that such insurance will be sufficient to compensate us for losses we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
we may be unable to protect and maintain the competitive advantage of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights and technology 
these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection of our proprietary rights and technology 
our proprietary rights and technology include confidential information and trade secrets which we attempt to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions in our licensing  services  reseller and other agreements 
we typically attempt to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through these contractual provisions for the term of the applicable agreement and  to the extent permitted by applicable law  for some negotiated period of time following termination of the agreement  typically one to two years at a minimum 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights and technology will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states 
no assurance can be given that claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement will not be brought 
many patents  copyrights and trademarks have been issued in the general areas of information and telecommunications services and computer telephony 
we believe that in the ordinary course of our business third parties will claim that our current or future products or services infringe the patent  copyright or trademark rights of such third parties 
no assurance can be given that actions or claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement will not be brought against us with respect to current or future products or services  or that  if such actions or claims are brought  we will ultimately prevail 
any such claiming parties may have significantly greater resources than we have to pursue litigation of such claims 
any such claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause delays in introducing new or improved products and services  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  or cause us to discontinue use of the challenged technology  tradename or service mark at potentially significant expense associated with the marketing of a new name or the development or purchase of replacement technology  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for a description of the company s material infringement claims  see part i business proprietary rights and technology of this form k 
we may lose revenue or incur additional costs because of failure to adequately address the year issue 
it is possible that a significant portion of our currently installed computer systems  software products  billing systems  telephony platforms  networks  database or other business systems hereinafter referred to collectively as systems  or those of our customers  vendors or resellers  working either alone or in conjunction with other software or systems  will not accept input of  store  manipulate and output dates for the years  or thereafter without error or interruption commonly known as the year problem 
we are currently in the process of evaluating our systems to determine whether or not modifications will be required to prevent problems related to the year although we have not completed our evaluation  we have identified certain of our systems that will require modification or upgrades to remedy year problems 
there can be no assurance that we will identify all such year problems in our systems or those of our customers or vendors  including network transmission providers  in advance of their occurrence or that we will be able to successfully remedy any problems that have been or may subsequently be discovered 
in addition  we are dependent upon third parties for transmission of its calls and other communications 
there can be no assurance that these third party providers will identify and remedy any year problems in their transmission facilities 
the expenses of our efforts to identify and address such problems  the expenses or liabilities to which we may be subject as a result of such problems  or the failure of third party providers of transmission facilities  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the financial stability of existing customers may be adversely impacted by year problems which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues 
in addition  any failure by us to identify and remedy year problems could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have corrected year problems 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the year issue 
one or more adverse outcomes in our pending litigation could have a material effect on our business 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are subject to claims and litigation from third parties alleging that our products and services infringe the patents  trademarks and copyrights of such third parties 
see risk of infringement claims 
we have several litigation matters pending not involving infringement claims which we are defending vigorously 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the litigation process and the judicial system  we are unable to predict the outcome of such litigation matters 
if the outcome of one or more of such matters is adverse to us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for a description of the company s pending material litigation  see item legal proceedings of this form k 
the company is also involved in various other legal proceedings which the company does not believe will have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  although no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings 
our quarterly results may not always meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
quarterly revenues are difficult to forecast because the market for our services is rapidly evolving 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations as to future revenues 
if revenue levels are below expectations  we may be unable or unwilling to reduce expenses proportionately and operating results would likely be adversely affected 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock will likely be materially adversely affected 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
specific factors that may cause our future operating results to vary include 
the unique nature of strategic relationships into which we may enter in the future  
changes in operating expenses resulting from such strategic relationships and other factors  
the continued acceptance of our licensing program  
the financial performance of our licensees and strategic partners  
the timing of new service announcements  
market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services  including orchestrate r  
acquisitions  
performance of strategic investments  
changes in legislation and regulations that may affect the competitive environment for our communications services  and 
general economic and seasonal factors 
in the future  revenues from our strategic relationships may become an increasingly significant portion of our total revenues 
due to the unique nature of each strategic relationship  these relationships may change the mix of our expenses relative to our revenues 
software failures or errors may result in failure of our networks and or platforms or loss of significant customers 
the software that we have developed and utilized in providing our services  including the orchestrate software  may contain undetected errors 
although we generally engage in extensive testing of our software prior to introducing the software onto any of our networks and or platforms  there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in the software after the software goes into use 
any such error may result in partial or total failure of our networks  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete a development project  and loss of revenue because of the inability of customers to use our networks or the cancellation by significant customers of their service with us  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we maintain technology errors and omissions insurance coverage of million per policy aggregate 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our technology errors and omissions insurance  that such insurance will continue to be available at reasonable prices or will be sufficient to compensate us for losses we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
interruption in long distance service could result in a loss of significant customers and revenue 
we do not own a transmission network and  accordingly  depend on mci worldcom  at t and other facilities based and non facilities based carriers for transmission of our customers long distance calls 
these long distance telecommunications services generally are procured pursuant to supply agreements for terms of three to five years  subject to earlier termination in certain events 
certain of these agreements provide for minimum purchase requirements 
further  we are dependent upon lecs or clecs for call origination and termination 
if there is an outage affecting one of our terminating carriers  our platform automatically switches calls to another terminating carrier if capacity is available 
we have not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of service at terminating carriers  but no assurance can be made in this regard in the future 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends  in part  on our ability to continue to obtain telecommunication services on favorable terms from long distance carriers and the cooperation of both interexchange and lecs or clecs in originating and terminating service for our customers in a timely manner 
the partial or total loss of the ability to receive or terminate calls would result in a loss of revenues and could lead to a loss of significant customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we lease capacity on the mci worldcom backbone to provide connectivity and data transmission within our private data network 
the telecommunication agreement expires in september our hub equipment is co located at various mci worldcom sites pursuant to co location agreements that are terminable by either party upon days written notice 
our ability to maintain network connectivity is dependent upon our access to transmission facilities provided by mci worldcom or an alternative provider 
we have no assurance that we will be able to continue our relationship with mci worldcom beyond the terms of our current agreements with mci worldcom or that we will be able to find an alternative provider on terms as favorable as those offered by mci worldcom or on any other terms 
if we were required to relocate our hub equipment or change our network transmission provider  we could experience shutdowns in our service and increase costs which could have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships and customer retention and  therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any significant difficulty obtaining voice messaging equipment from suppliers could adversely effect our business 
we do not manufacture voice messaging equipment used at our voice messaging service centers  and such equipment is currently available from a limited number of sources 
although we have not historically experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining equipment required for our operations and believe that viable alternative suppliers exist  no assurance can be given that shortages will not arise in the future or that alternative suppliers will be available 
our inability to obtain voice messaging equipment could result in delays or reduced delivery of messages which would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  technological advances may result in the development of new voice messaging equipment and changing industry standards and there can be no assurance that our voice messaging equipment will not become obsolete 
such events would require us to invest significant capital in upgrading or replacing our voice messaging equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
various regulatory factors affect our financial performance and our ability to compete 
our operating subsidiaries that provide regulated long distance telecommunications services are subject to regulation by the fcc and by various state public service and public utility commissions pucs  and are otherwise affected by regulatory decisions  trends and policies made by these agencies 
fcc rules currently require interexchange carriers to permit resale of their transmission services 
fcc rules also require lecs to provide all interexchange carriers with equal access to local exchange facilities for purposes of origination and termination of long distance calls 
if either or both of these requirements were eliminated  we could be adversely affected 
moreover  the underlying carriers that provide services to our operating subsidiaries or that originate or terminate the operating subsidiaries traffic may increase rates or experience disruptions in service due to factors outside our control  which could cause the operating subsidiaries to experience increases in rates for telecommunications services or disruptions in transmitting their subscribers long distance calls 
pci has made the requisite filings with the fcc to provide interstate and international long distance services 
in order to provide intrastate long distance service  pci generally is required to obtain certification from state pucs  to register with such state pucs or to be found exempt from registration by such state pucs 
pci has either filed the applications necessary to provide intrastate long distance telecommunications services throughout the united states or is in the process of filing such applications 
to date  pci is authorized to provide long distance telecommunications services in states and in the district of columbia and is seeking authorization to provide long distance telecommunications services in four states 
with the exception of three states  colorado  michigan and arizona  in which pci s applications to provide operator service ie  are pending  pci is authorized to provide operator service in each state where pci provides long distance telecommunications service 
in addition  as a condition of providing intrastate long distance services  pci generally is required to comply with puc tariffing requirements  reporting obligations and regulatory assessments  and to submit to puc jurisdiction over complaints  transfers of control and certain financing transactions 
pci uses reasonable efforts to ensure that its operations comply with these regulatory requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that pci is currently in compliance with all puc regulatory requirements 
further pci s facilities do not prevent subscribers from using the facilities to make long distance calls in any state  including states in which pci currently is not authorized to provide intrastate telecommunications services and operator services 
there can be no assurance that pci s provision of long distance telecommunications and operator services in states where it is not in compliance with puc requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the act is intended to increase competition in the long distance and local telecommunications markets 
the act opens competition in the local services market and  at the same time  contains provisions intended to protect consumers and businesses from unfair competition by incumbent lecs  including the rbocs 
the act allows rbocs to provide long distance service outside of their local service territories but bars them from immediately offering in region interlata long distance services until certain conditions are satisfied 
an rboc must apply to the fcc to provide in region interlata long distance services and must satisfy a set of pro competitive criteria intended to ensure that rbocs open their own local markets to competition before the fcc will approve such application 
further  while the fcc has final authority to grant or deny such rboc application  the fcc must consult with the department of justice to determine if  among other things  the entry of the rboc would be in the public interest  and with the relevant state to determine if the pro competitive criteria have been satisfied 
while the fcc has yet to grant any rboc interlata application  we are unable to determine how the fcc will rule on any such applications in the future 
in response to a constitutional challenge filed by sbc communications inc  the united states district court for the northern district of texas found the act s restrictions on rboc interlata services to be an unconstitutional bill of attainder  but stayed the effect of its decision pending further appeal 
as a result of the act and if the in region interlata restrictions are ultimately struck down  we may experience increased competition from others  including the rbocs 
in addition  our operating subsidiaries may be subject to additional regulatory requirements and fees  including universal service assessments and payphone compensation surcharges resulting from the implementation of the act 
in conducting its business  we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to commercial transactions generally  such as the uniform commercial code and is also subject to the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
congress has held hearings regarding  and various agencies are considering  whether to regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
for example  the federal reserve completed a study  directed by congress  regarding the propriety of applying regulation e to stored value cards 
the department of treasury has promulgated proposed rules applying record keeping  reporting and other requirements to a wide variety of entities involved in electronic commerce 
it is possible that congress  the states or various government agencies could impose new or additional requirements on the electronic commerce market or entities operating therein 
if enacted  such laws  rules and regulations could be imposed on our business and industry and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our proposed international activities also will be subject to regulation by various international authorities and the inherent risk of unexpected changes in such regulation 
our expansion into international markets may not be successful a key component of our strategy is our planned expansion into international markets 
if international revenues are not adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these international operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate voice and data messaging service centers in canada  australia  new zealand and puerto rico 
new voice and data messaging service centers have recently been established in the united kingdom  germany  italy  japan  hong kong and south korea 
in addition  conferencing operations were recently established in canada 
we also plan to establish conferencing operations or capability in the united kingdom  germany  france  singapore  australia and hong kong 
while our document distribution subsidiary has significant international experience  we only have limited experience in marketing and distributing our voice and data messaging and conferencing services internationally 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully 
establish the proposed conferencing operations or capabilities  or 
market  sell and deliver our voice and data messaging and conferencing services in the new international markets 
there are certain risks inherent to international operations 
in addition to the uncertainty as to our ability to expand our international presence  there are certain difficulties and risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as burdensome regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in these requirements  export restrictions  export controls relating to technology  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we typically denominate foreign transactions in foreign currency and have not regularly engaged in hedging transactions  although we may engage in hedging transactions from time to time in the future 
in connection with one acquisition we borrowed funds denominated in the local currency 
we have not experienced any material losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  but there can be no assurance that we will not incur material losses due to currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
we rely on international operations for significant revenues from enhanced document distribution services a significant portion of our document distribution business is conducted outside the united states and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses from that business are derived in foreign currencies 
accordingly  the results of operations from our document distribution business may be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies 
many aspects of our international operations and business expansion plans are subject to foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of our document distribution business within such governments countries  including increased tariffs 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
we may not be able to expand our document distribution services 
we intend to accelerate growth of our document distribution services throughout the world by expansion of our proprietary private world wide document distribution network the document distribution network  the integration of that network with our private frame relay network and computer telephony platforms and the acquisition of entities engaged in the business of electronic document distribution services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand our ability to provide electronic document services at a rate or in a manner satisfactory to meet the demands of existing or future customers  including  but not limited to  increasing the capacity of the document distribution network to process increasing amounts of document traffic  integrating and increasing the capability of the document distribution network to perform tasks required by our customers or identifying and establishing alliances with new partners in order to enable us to expand our network in new geographic regions 
such inability may adversely affect customer relationships and perceptions of our business in the markets in which we provide services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  such growth will involve substantial investments of capital  management and other resources 
there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash for future growth of our document distribution business through earnings or external financings  or that such external financings will be available on terms acceptable to us or that we will be able to employ any such resources in a manner that will result in accelerated growth 
returned transactions or thefts of services could adversely effect our business 
although we believe that our risk management and bad debt reserve practices are adequate  there can be no assurance that our risk management practices  including our internal controls  or reserves will be sufficient to protect us from unauthorized or returned transactions or thefts of services which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we use two principal financial payment clearance systems in connection with our enhanced calling services the federal reserve s automated clearing house for electronic fund transfers  and the national credit card systems for electronic credit card settlement 
in our use of these established payment clearance systems  we generally bear credit risks similar to those normally assumed by other users of these systems arising from returned transactions caused by insufficient funds  stop payment orders  closed accounts  frozen accounts  unauthorized use  disputes  theft or fraud 
from time to time  persons have gained unauthorized access to our network and obtained services without rendering payment to us by unlawfully using the access numbers and personal identification numbers pins of authorized users 
in addition  in connection with our wholesale prepaid telephone card relationships  we have experienced unauthorized activation of prepaid telephone cards 
no assurance can be given that losses due to unauthorized use of access numbers and pins  unauthorized activation of prepaid calling cards or activation of prepaid calling cards in excess of the prepaid amount  or theft of prepaid calling cards will not be material 
we attempt to manage these risks through our internal controls and proprietary billing systems 
our computer telephony platform is designed to prohibit a single access number and pin from establishing multiple simultaneous connections to the platform  and generally we establish preset spending limits for each subscriber 
we also maintain reserves for such risks 
past experience in estimating and establishing reserves and our historical losses are not necessarily accurate indicators of future losses or the adequacy of the reserves we may establish in the future 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia law may inhibit a takeover
