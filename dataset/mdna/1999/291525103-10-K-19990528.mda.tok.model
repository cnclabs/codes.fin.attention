item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the company evaluates performance of its operating entities based on broadcast cash flow bcf and publishing cash flow pcf 
management believes that bcf and pcf are useful because they provide a meaningful comparison of operating performance between companies in the industry and serve as an indicator of the market value of a group of stations or publishing entities 
bcf and pcf are generally recognized by the broadcast and publishing industries as a measure of performance and are used by analysts who report on the performance of broadcasting and publishing groups 
bcf and pcf do not take into account emmis debt service requirements and other commitments and  accordingly  bcf and pcf are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for dividends  reinvestment in emmis business or other discretionary uses 
bcf and pcf are not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles 
moreover  bcf and pcf are not standardized measures and may be calculated in a number of ways 
emmis defines bcf and pcf as revenues net of agency commissions and operating expenses 
the primary source of broadcast advertising revenues is the sale of advertising time to local and national advertisers 
publishing entities derive revenue from subscriptions and sale of print advertising 
the most significant broadcast operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  costs associated with programming  advertising and promotion  and station general and administrative costs 
significant publishing operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  costs associated with producing the magazine  and general and administrative costs 
the company s revenues are affected primarily by the advertising rates its entities charge 
these rates are in large part based on the entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
broadcast entities ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron radio market reports for radio stations and by ac nielsen company for television stations 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  the company s strategy is to use market research and advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services which can be used by the station in its business operations 
the company generally confines the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which the company would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is the company s general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade

impact of the year emmis has completed its assessment phase of year compliance for information technology for all of its radio broadcasting properties except those included in the wabash valley acquisition 
the company has also completed its assessment of other equipment  including broadcast equipment and embedded technology  at certain radio properties 
assessment of year compliance at newly acquired television stations  corporate and publishing entities is partially complete 
certain information technology and other equipment is represented by its vendors to be year compliant 
technology and equipment that is currently not represented as year compliant will be upgraded or replaced  and tested prior to august  in connection with the move of our corporate and indianapolis operations to an office building in downtown indianapolis  substantially all information technology and other equipment in the building has been replaced and is believed to be year compliant 
emmis estimates that the cost of the remaining year remediation effort will be approximately million  which will be funded from current operations 
emmis has not separately tracked costs incurred to date relating to year compliance  however  management believes that these costs have been insignificant 
emmis has trained its employees regarding year issues and compliance 
certain employees at each entity are responsible for year compliance 
emmis information systems department is currently auditing the year compliance of each entity 
this audit includes verifying that critical applications have been identified  testing of critical applications  ensuring that year compliance documentation exists  verifying that remediation is occurring as planned and developing written contingency plans 
the audit should be complete by august  if certain broadcast equipment and information technology is not year compliant prior to january   an entity using that equipment and information technology might not be able to broadcast and process transactions 
if this were to occur  temporary solutions or processes not involving the malfunctioning equipment could be implemented 
the contingency plans documented during the audit process would be used to implement such temporary solutions 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of emmis due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
emmis is exposed to market risk from changes in domestic and international interest rates ie prime and libor and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage this exposure emmis periodically enters into interest rate derivative agreements 
emmis does not use financial instruments for trading and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
interest rates at february  emmis entire outstanding balance under the credit facility  or approximately of emmis credit facility and senior subordinated debt outstanding bears interest at variable rates 
emmis currently hedges a portion of its outstanding debt with interest rate caps that effectively cap the credit facility s underlying base rate at a weighted average rate of on the three month libor for agreements in place as of february  assuming the current level of borrowings protected under interest rate cap agreements and that libor increased from the rates at february  to the cap rates  interest expense would have increased by million and net income would have decreased by million 
the credit facility requires emmis to maintain interest rate protection agreements through july the notional amount required varies based upon emmis ratio of adjusted debt to ebitda  as defined in the credit facility 
the notional amount of the agreements at february  totaled million and expire at various dates ranging from april to february the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements was  at february  foreign currency emmis owns a interest in a hungarian subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in their local currency 
emmis has a natural hedge through some of the subsidiary s long term obligations being denominated in hungarian forints 
emmis maintains no other derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the hungarian forint would not be material
