item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we operate principally in two lines of business the development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of gaming products gaming product sales  and the development  marketing and operation of proprietary wide area progressive systems and gaming equipment leasing gaming operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net income of million or per diluted share included certain one time charges recorded in the fourth quarter totaling million million or per diluted share  net of tax effects as discussed below 
an extraordinary loss on early redemption of debt of million or per diluted share was also recognized during fiscal net income for the year ended october  before the one time charges and extraordinary loss totaled million or per diluted share versus net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal the one time charges of million consist primarily of the write off of intangible assets of million related to igt australia s prior acquisition of olympic amusements 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in an effort to return igt australia to a profitable operation  we are currently in the process of a significant restructuring which includes narrowing current product lines and utilizing igt s reno  nevada manufacturing plant to reduce product costs 
we recorded restructuring costs of million in fiscal related to this plan  including a million inventory obsolescence charge and million in asset and facility redundancy costs 
we estimate an additional million in costs will be incurred during fiscal  resulting from redundancy in our sales  engineering  manufacturing and support departments 
we also recorded impairment charges of million in fiscal  relating to changes in our recoverability assessment of inventory and receivables in brazil 
the government in brazil recently rescinded the law allowing gaming devices in bingo halls throughout this market 
revenues and cost of sales fiscal revenues of million improved over fiscal revenues of million 
this improvement resulted from a increase in product sales revenue as well as a increase in gaming operations revenue 
we shipped  gaming machines for total product sales revenues of million in fiscal compared to  units for million in the prior fiscal year 
domestic shipments totaled  units for the year ended october  compared to  units in the year earlier period 
the four major new casino openings in the las vegas  nevada market as well as growth in the canadian and native american markets  positively impacted domestic product sales during current year shipments to new las vegas properties included park place s paris resort  the resort at summerlin  circus circus new mandalay bay and the venetian resort 
also contributing to the current year improvement were shipments of  machines to the ontario lottery commission and  machines to the new mgm and circus circus casinos in detroit  michigan 
domestic revenues for the current fiscal period also benefited from increased demand in the native american market 
in june  we became a licensed manufacturer for native american venues in washington 
current year sales included  games for a market share of approximately to a washington licensee who designs and markets gaming machines for placement in eight native american casinos 
international shipments of  machines accounted for of total units  the highest percentage in our history  compared to  machines in fiscal this growth in international unit shipments was driven primarily by japan and barcrest which contributed increased shipments of approximately  units each 
growth in japanese pachisuro sales were driven by the introduction of popular game themes including popper king  dynamite and elvis 
current year shipments for barcrest  which was acquired in march  include a full year of results 
machine shipments in the australia market totaled  units in fiscal compared to  machines last year 
the lack of anticipated growth in the current year unit sales as a result of the olympic acquisition influenced our assessment of the igt australia intangible asset impairment 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the gross margin on product sales was in the current year period compared to in fiscal this fluctuation is the result of an increase in the mix of new domestic product lines  including game king and vision  which have lower gross margin percentages yet higher gross margin dollars along with increased obsolescence expense domestically 
the gross margin was also impacted by the higher percentage of international sales during which are typically at lower gross margins 
gaming operations revenue for the year ended october  totaled million compared to million in fiscal this growth primarily resulted from joint venture activities 
the total installed base of gaming machines operating on our megajackpot systems at october  increased to  games on systems from  machines on systems at the end of fiscal joint venture games including wheel of fortune contributed million to total gaming operations revenues 
during the year we began operating megajackpot systems in two new jurisdictions  iowa and michigan 
we introduced new systems in nine jurisdictions during the year including slotopoly  elvis  party time and triple play poker in megajackpots format in atlantic city 
the introduction of these new systems in various jurisdictions offset the decrease in revenue of other maturing systems 
we continue to pursue additional markets  domestically and internationally  for linked progressive games 
the gross margin on gaming operations revenues was compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this improvement was due primarily to profits from joint venture activities which  for accounting purposes  are reported net of expenses in gaming operations revenues 
additionally  higher average interest rates lowered the cost of funding jackpot payments 
expenses fiscal operating expenses totaled million including the million impairment of assets and restructuring charges 
operating expenses before the one time charges discussed above as a percent of total revenue were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects the inclusion of operating expenses attributable to the businesses acquired in the uk and australia in march  along with increased wages  professional services and domestic advertising  marketing  and compliance expenses related to new product offerings 
depreciation and amortization expenses totaled million in the current year compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to amortization of goodwill and additional depreciation of the acquired assets 
research and development expenses increased million compared to the prior year due to the inclusion of a full year of barcrest uk and olympic operations along with higher engineering expenditures domestically related to the development of over new games 
bad debt expense increased million over fiscal due to growth in product sales as well as additional reserves for gaming operations activities 
other income and expense other expense  net for the current year totaled million and was impacted by interest expense of million on the billion senior notes issued in may other income  net for the comparable prior year period totaled million which included a gain on the sale of the igt australia manufacturing facility of million 
operation of our megajackpot systems results in interest income from both the investment of cash and from investments purchased to fund jackpot payments 
interest expense on the jackpot liability is accrued at the rate earned on the investments purchased to fund the liability 
therefore  interest income and expense relating to funding jackpot winners are similar and increase at approximately the same rate based on the growth in total jackpot winners 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued business segments operating profit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements manufacturing and gaming operations operating profit reflects an allocation of selling  general  administrative and engineering expenses to each of these business segments 
manufacturing operating loss was million for the year ended october  including the one time charges for impairment and restructuring of million 
manufacturing operating profit before these charges totaled million compared to million in the prior period 
this fluctuation resulted from a decline in the gross margin to from in the prior year as well as increased domestic advertising  marketing and compliance expenses  increased selling expenses in japan and the inclusion of a full year of operating expenses from barcrest and olympic 
fiscal gaming operations operating profit increased million or compared to the prior year period 
this improvement resulted primarily from the continued popularity of wheel of fortune and higher average interest rates which resulted in lower costs of funding jackpot payments 
fiscal compared to fiscal net income for the year ended september  totaled million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for fiscal continued growth in proprietary systems revenue and increased international product sales  primarily due to acquisitions  were the most significant contributors to the improvement in net income over the prior year period 
revenues and cost of sales fiscal revenues of million improved over fiscal revenues of million 
this improvement resulted from a increase in gaming operations revenues as well as a small increase in product sales 
we shipped  gaming machines for total product sales revenues of million in fiscal compared to  units for million in the prior fiscal year 
domestic revenues were influenced by a shift in demand to igt s newer  more advanced product lines such as the game king  s plus limited and vision machines 
due to the advanced features and components of these products  they carry a higher average price per unit 
the percentage of new product lines increased to of total domestic units sold for fiscal  compared to in the prior year  resulting in higher average revenue per unit overall 
domestic shipments totaled  units for the year ended september  compared to  units in the year earlier period 
we maintained our market share in domestic markets where fewer new casino openings and expansions slowed growth in fiscal fiscal domestic shipments included  units to sodak  igt s distributor to native american markets  and  machines shipped to bellagio  mirage resorts newest luxury resort in las vegas 
international unit shipments of  accounted for of total units compared to  in fiscal international unit shipments improved due primarily to acquisitions along with improved sales in south africa and latin america 
barcrest  igt s subsidiary in the uk  sold  units since its acquisition by igt in march machine shipments to argentina and other latin america markets increased to  units in the current year   more than in fiscal igt sold  units in the south african market including sales to newly licensed casinos in the gauteng province 
shipments to other international jurisdictions including europe  japan and asia remained consistent or increased slightly year over year 
machine shipments in the australia market totaled  units in fiscal  including  olympic machines  compared to  units in fiscal the gross margin on product sales was in the current year period compared to in fiscal this fluctuation is the result of an increase in the mix of new product lines  including game king  s plus limited and vision  which have lower gross margin percentages yet higher gross margin dollars 
the gross margin was also impacted by the higher percentage of international sales during which are typically at lower gross margins 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued gaming operations revenue totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal this increase was the result of continued popularity of wheel of fortune  strong play on nevada megabucks and the introduction of new systems 
the total installed base of gaming machines operating on igt s megajackpot systems at september  increased to  games on systems from  machines on systems at the end of fiscal joint venture games including wheel of fortune contributed million to total gaming operations revenues 
joint venture results are reported net of expenses in gaming operations revenue 
the nevada megabucks jackpot attained record levels in contributing to the year over year improvement in gaming operations revenues 
igt introduced new systems in jurisdictions during the year including slotopoly in nevada and jeopardy in six jurisdictions 
the current year also benefited from a full year of operation of megajackpots in missouri where linked progressive systems were introduced in june the gross margin on gaming operations revenues was compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this improvement was due primarily to profits from joint venture activities which  for accounting purposes  are reported net of expenses in gaming operations revenues 
however  declining interest rates for the year resulted in higher costs for the interest sensitive assets which we purchase to fund jackpot payments 
expenses operating expenses as a percent of total revenue were in both fiscal and the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects the additional operating expenses of barcrest and olympic 
domestic selling  general and administrative expenses remained consistent with the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expenses totaled million in the current year compared to million in fiscal this increase reflects the amortization of the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired in the barcrest and olympic acquisitions as well as additional depreciation on the acquired assets 
research and development expenses increased million relative to the prior year 
the additional research and development centers in the uk and australia  along with our commitment to new product development domestically  contributed to a increase in research and development personnel from the prior year 
bad debt expense declined relative to the prior year as we aligned the receivable reserve with favorable collection experience 
other income and expense other income and expense decreased million to million for the year compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to increased interest costs of million on the corporate and australian lines of credit due to borrowings related to the acquisitions of barcrest and olympic and treasury stock purchases 
operation of our megajackpot systems results in interest income from both the investment of systems cash and from investments purchased to fund jackpot payments 
interest expense on the jackpot liability is accrued at the rate earned on the investments purchased to fund the liability 
therefore  interest income and expense relating to funding jackpot winners are equal and increase at the same rate based on the growth in total jackpot winners 
interest income from investment of systems cash increased million over fiscal as a result of growth in proprietary systems 
we sold our australian manufacturing and office facility at a gain of approximately million during the year 
the company leases back approximately one third of the facility for its australian operations 
the gain on the sale of assets in the prior period related to sales of investment securities 
business segments operating profit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements manufacturing and gaming operations operating profit reflects an allocation of selling  general  administrative and engineering expenses to each of these business segments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued manufacturing operating profit was million for the year ended september  compared to million in the prior period 
this fluctuation resulted from a decline in product sales gross margin due to lower unit sales volume and an increase in the sales of new product lines that have a lower gross margin 
a higher percentage of international sales  which typically have lower gross margins  also impacted operating profit for the manufacturing segment 
fiscal gaming operations operating profit increased million or compared to the prior year period 
this improvement resulted primarily from the continued popularity of wheel of fortune and strong play on nevada megabucks 
higher costs of interest sensitive assets purchased to fund jackpot payments partially offset the overall increase 
foreign operations approximately of our total product sales in fiscal and in fiscal were derived outside of north america 
to date  we have not experienced significant translation or transaction losses related to foreign exchange fluctuations 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we believe that existing cash balances  short term investments and available borrowing capacity together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for the next twelve months 
igt s unrestricted cash and short term investments are available for strategic investments  mergers and acquisitions  as well as to fund our stock repurchase program 
working capital working capital increased million to million since the prior year end due primarily to excess proceeds from the billion senior notes issued in may investments to fund liabilities to jackpot winners and the corresponding jackpot liabilities decreased due to payments to prior jackpot winners who elected a discounted single cash payment in lieu of annual installments 
additional changes in current assets contributed to the overall fluctuation in working capital including an increase in accounts receivable  offset by inventory reductions 
both were the result of sales volumes 
changes in current liabilities included a decrease in current maturities of long term debt resulting from the repayment of outstanding debt with proceeds from the billion senior notes issued in may the decrease in current maturities of long term debt was partially offset by increases in other current liabilities  including accrued income taxes and accrued interest on new borrowings 
cash flows igt s cash and cash equivalents totaled million at october   a million increase from the prior fiscal year end 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal during these periods  fluctuations in receivables and inventories were influenced by sales volumes and timing and resulted in the most significant changes in cash flows from operating activities 
our proprietary systems provide cash through collections from systems to fund jackpot liabilities and from maturities of us government securities purchased to fund jackpot liabilities 
cash is used to make payments to jackpot winners or to purchase investments to fund liabilities to jackpot winners 
these activities used cash of million in the current year 
the net cash provided for fiscal was million and million for fiscal fiscal cash flows from operating activities increased due to the realization of deferred tax assets related to the timing of the tax deductibility of jackpot payments 
federal legislation was passed in october which allows jackpot winners to receive the discounted value of progressive jackpots won in lieu of annual installments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the primary use of investing cash in the current year related to the acquisition of businesses see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
uses of cash from investing activities also included purchases of property  plant and equipment totaling million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal related primarily to the construction of our manufacturing and administrative facilities in reno  nevada 
the primary use of financing cash in the current year related to treasury stock purchases of million 
purchases of treasury stock were million in fiscal and million in fiscal proceeds from additional borrowings of million  net of repayments on outstanding lines of credit and senior notes redeemed  were used primarily to fund stock repurchases and working capital 
net borrowings in the prior year period were used primarily to acquire businesses and purchase treasury shares 
stock repurchase plan a stock repurchase plan was originally authorized by our board of directors in october as of november   igt could purchase an additional million shares under the authorization as modified by the board of directors 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
during the period of october  through november   we purchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
recently issued accounting standards on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year ending september  we believe that adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
reclassifications certain amounts in the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the presentation used in fiscal year lines of credit our domestic and foreign borrowing facilities totaled million at october  of this amount  million was drawn  million was reserved for letters of credit and the remaining million was available 
we are required to comply with certain covenants contained in these agreements which  among other things  limit financial commitments we may make without the written consent of the lenders and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at october   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
in may  igt completed the private placement of billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the senior notes were issued in two tranches million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  due may   priced at and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  due may   priced at 
in august  we exchanged all outstanding senior notes due and all outstanding senior notes due for identical registered notes 
a portion of the proceeds was used to redeem previously outstanding senior notes due this resulted in a prepayment penalty of million after tax  and is reflected in the income statement as an extraordinary expense 
additionally  we repaid outstanding borrowings under both our us revolving bank credit facility and our australian credit facility and settled a forward equity share repurchase of million shares of our common stock 
the remaining net proceeds from the offering were used to finance our acquisition of sodak and to fund working capital and our common stock repurchase program 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations during the three fiscal years in the period ended october  year the term yk is used to refer to a worldwide computer related problem where software programs and embedded programs in computer systems will not work properly when processing a date later than december  if igt or its customers  suppliers  or other third parties fail to make corrections for programs that have defined dates using a two digit year  this could result in system failure or malfunction of certain computer equipment  software  and other devices dependent upon computerized mechanisms that are date sensitive 
this problem may cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
assessments of the potential cost and effects of year issues vary significantly among businesses  and it is difficult to predict the actual impact 
recognizing this uncertainty  we have and are continuing to actively analyze  assess  and plan for various year contingencies across our company 
we have undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that our computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in and beyond the year information technology it systems impacted by the year issue include systems commonly thought of as it systems  such as accounting  data processing and telephone pbx systems  as well as systems that are not commonly thought of as it systems  such as alarm systems  security systems  fax machines  mail machines  automated assembly lines  and other miscellaneous systems 
both it and non it systems may contain imbedded technology which compounds the identification  assessment  remediation  and testing efforts 
we are utilizing both internal and external resources to accomplish our year plan  which began in december with the exception of igt australia  we are substantially complete 
we estimate that as of november   we had completed approximately of the initiatives necessary to fully address potential year issues 
the remaining project efforts are underway and we anticipate these will be completed prior to any currently anticipated impact on our computer equipment and software 
all of our subsidiaries have performed the identification  assessment  remediation and testing phases 
we have identified our largest manufacturing locations  igt north america  igt australia  igt japan and igt uk as critical operating locations as most other subsidiaries are dependent upon these locations 
igt uses an as for the majority of its north american software applications  including the manufacturing process  and has identified this as a critical system 
the yk readiness project efforts on the as system are complete 
igt uk has finished the implementation of oracle as an enterprise wide improvement to its information systems and a resolution to yk readiness issues 
we engaged third parties to review the igt and igt uk information systems plans 
their recommendations have been incorporated into our plan 
igt japan utilizes a third party to manufacture its products and has received assurance that this manufacturer is year ready 
igt australia restructured its information systems department under a new director in the third fiscal quarter and has now completed its assessment phase of its year efforts 
igt australia s yk project plan is complete with regard to internal business systems 
the remediation of their gaming systems is now fully underway and scheduled for completion by december  in addition  we have assessed the risk and reviewed year readiness plans of sodak see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
sodak has implemented the integrated oracle application system as an enterprise wide improvement to their information systems and a resolution to year processing requirements 
the majority of their application systems have been tested and remediated 
at this stage  we believe that our year deficiencies will be remedied through computer equipment and software replacement or modification in a timely fashion 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued we have also initiated efforts to ensure the readiness of our products and services 
as part of our assessment of current products and services  we have completed upgrading all wide area progressive jackpot system software in all jurisdictions 
all of our customers who may have products with year readiness issues have been notified 
we have also surveyed our key vendors and service providers to determine the extent to which interfaces with these entities make us vulnerable to year issues 
as of november   we received responses from approximately of such third parties 
the majority of these entities provided assurances that they are either year ready or expect to address all their significant year issues on a timely basis 
we continue to follow up with significant vendors and service providers that did not initially respond  or whose responses were deemed unsatisfactory by us 
while we have developed a system of communicating with vendors to understand their ability to continue providing services and products through the year without interruption  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which we may rely will be timely converted or that such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on our systems 
at this time  we do not believe that the cost of our year efforts will exceed million  which will be funded from operating cash flows 
approximately million of this total was for the replacement of non compliant equipment and software which we capitalized as fixed assets in fiscal as of november   we spent approximately million  including the cost of third party reviews 
two of our subsidiaries have implemented enterprise wide information system improvements which will also resolve year issues 
these costs were not included in the above amount because the implementations were not initiated specifically to resolve the year issue 
a major portion of the software remediation costs are not likely to be incremental to our results of operations  but will represent the redeployment of existing information technology and other resources 
as a result of the redeployment of internal resources for the year remediation efforts  certain enhancements of our current systems may be postponed 
we do not anticipate the postponement of these enhancements to have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the year issue presents a number of other risks and uncertainties that could impact igt  including  but not limited to third parties whose services we rely upon to produce and sell our products  such as key suppliers and customers  public utilities  telecommunication providers  financial institutions  or certain regulators of the various jurisdictions where we do business 
failure or interruption of any of these services could result in lost production  sales  or administrative difficulties on the part of igt 
we believe that the implementation of new business systems and the completion of the year project as scheduled will significantly reduce the risk of operational difficulties within our operating systems  facilities and products 
the majority of our application systems have been remedied and tested 
in those instances where completion by the end of is not assured  we have contingency plans in place or that are in the final stages of development 
our yk contingency plans include manual processing procedures and additional stand by is support staff incorporated within our existing disaster recovery plans 
our year project teams are reviewing the support which may be necessary during the first week of the new year to investigate non functioning applications  remediate and test the programs  and implement the corrected applications 
in addition  manual back up procedures are being considered in user areas to ensure continuity of essential business operations 
we believe that our most reasonably likely exposure to year readiness issues is in the igt australia gaming systems 
igt australia is remediating these systems and preparing a contingency plan 
while we continue to believe the year issues will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations  it remains uncertain as to what extent  if any  we may be impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative factors about market risk market risk under established procedures and controls  the company enters into contractual arrangements  or derivatives  in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions 
although the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties  management believes that losses related to counterparty credit risk is not likely 
foreign currency risk we routinely use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net exposures  by currency  related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations denominated in non functional currency 
the primary business objective of this hedging program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes 
at october  and september   igt had net foreign currency transaction exposure of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal and  million and million of the exposure was hedged with currency forward contracts 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
given our balanced foreign exchange position  a ten percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses from these contracts that would  in all material aspects  be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of igt s international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
igt does not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
igt does not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings 
changes in the currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating igt s international operating results include the australian dollar  british pound and the japanese yen 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating results by less than million 
this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one area may or may not be offset by losses from another area 
interest rate risk igt s results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in the costs of us government securities used to fund liabilities to jackpot winners 
igt records gaming operations expense for future jackpots based on current rates for these us government securities which are impacted by market interest rates and other economic conditions 
therefore  the gross profit on gaming operations decreases when interest rates decline 
management estimates that a decline in interest rates would impact gaming operations gross profit by million 
igt currently does not manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
the billion senior notes issued in may carry interest at fixed rates 
if interest rates increased by  then the fair market value of the notes would decrease approximately million
