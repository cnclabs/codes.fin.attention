in an effort to address yk compliance issues  the scope of the project was expanded to ensure yk compliance for newly acquired software and hardware as well as test existing systems for compliance 
from this process  a team representing different areas of the company was assembled to specifically work toward timely yk compliance 
as of august   the company s progress toward completion of yk remediation projects is as follows state of readiness the project has three significant phases that are designed to improve both operating processes and information systems capabilities 
the first phase of the project included hardware and software for the company s financial reporting and manufacturing operations and was made operational in august phase two focused on payroll and human resource applications and became operational in january phase three addresses the order to collect systems and is expected to be completed in various stages through the year with critical applications to be made yk compliant before the end of within the framework of this project  the company s information systems fall into four general categories i financial  ii supply chain  iii order to collect  and iv office support 
the financial system includes the general ledger  accounts payable  sales and use tax calculations  payroll and human resources applications 
phase one of the project provided systems and hardware that are yk compliant for the general ledger  accounts payable and sales and use tax calculations 
payroll and human resource systems were the subject of phase two  which was made operational with compliant hardware and software in january the supply chain system includes applications for production planning  purchasing and product management 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed upgrading supply chain systems with the implementation of a new inventory management system 
supply chain systems were elements of phases one and three and have been certified by the hardware and software manufacturers as yk compliant 
the company s order to collect system includes legacy applications for order entry  seminar registration  retail sales  order fulfillment  order shipping  invoicing and collections 
these systems will be affected by phase three of the project and completion is expected in various stages through the year the office support system includes network hardware and operating systems  servers  desktop and laptop computers and includes applications not specifically addressed by the project 
in order to correct possible yk problems  the company has developed a plan to assess potential yk problems  prioritize identified problems as critical or non critical  test compliance of critical systems and implement solutions for all critical systems 
to ensure yk readiness  all significant company systems  including completed project modules  were subject to assessment and testing 
the company has completed its assessment of office support systems and applications that could have a significant impact on the company s ability to sell and deliver its products and services 
following the assessment  all problems were prioritized in order to mitigate problems with business critical systems 
this includes network hardware and operating systems  servers and desktop and laptop computers 
the company s office support systems compliance analysis is also completed 
the operating systems  server hardware and desktop computers are tested and are yk compliant 
the networking environment is completed with the remaining representing architectural changes that eliminate software and hardware that will not be made compliant by the vendor or are deemed unnecessary by changing technology 
the completion date for this phase of testing is expected to be november  the company s support system applications include two categories of products 
the first category represents purchased  or off the shelf applications 
the second category represents applications developed inside the company 
certifications of compliance for purchased applications have been obtained from the various software vendors 
the company is confident that all necessary updates have been made based on vendor instructions and at this point  the company is reliant on the latest compliance information gathered from its vendors 
the company is currently monitoring its software vendors for changes to their yk compliance statements 
applications developed in house have also been reviewed 
code analysis and process tests will continue through december  the company is confident  based on current analysis and test results that it will not be adversely affected by yk related problems 
in addition  the company s electronic data interface edi system has been replaced  tested and certified as yk compliant

cost to address yk issues as of august   the company has acquired million of hardware and million of software in connection with the project 
consultants were also engaged to implement software modules and improve business processes  but not necessarily to provide specific yk remediation services 
the company does not expect to spend further material amounts for direct costs related to the assessment and correction of potential yk issues 
risk of the company s yk issues the primary yk risk to the company is from external vendors and service providers 
as part of its assessment of yk issues  the company has gathered information from its suppliers and other external vendors regarding their yk compliance status 
based upon information received  the most significant risk to the company appears to be from certain critical international suppliers that  despite their best efforts  may be affected by utility outages and may not be able to meet delivery deadlines 
the company has obtained yk compliance information from its two largest shipping service providers and does not believe that yk issues will adversely affect product shipments 
based upon inquiry responses  the company does not anticipate any significant problems from its utility  telephone and financial service providers 
although the company is not aware of any other external risks  the company has no means of ensuring that all external vendors and service providers will be yk compliant 
the inability of certain external vendors or service providers to complete their yk remediation efforts in a timely manner could materially affect the operations of the company 
however  the effect of yk non compliance by external vendors is not readily determinable 
the company has also assessed yk compliance issues related to its products available for sale and does not believe that yk presents a material exposure to the company related to its products 
contingency plans the company is finalizing contingency plans and testing manual process scenarios for the critical functions within the business units 
the plans are expected to be complete prior to december  the company s plan to complete yk remediation efforts is based upon management s best estimates  which are subject to numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the availability of certain resources and other circumstances beyond the control of management 
estimated completion dates and total costs are based upon current levels of activity and specific efforts to correct potential yk problems 
however  there can be no guarantee that stated estimates can be achieved and actual results may differ materially from current expectations 
specific factors that may result in material differences include  but are not limited to  availability of critical application corrections  the availability of required hardware and other similar uncertainties

retail store sales increased due to five additional stores and a increase in comparable store sales 
at august   the company was operating retail stores compared to stores at august  comparable store sales growth was primarily attributable to increased sales of technology related products such as the palm v tm by com r bundled with the company s new franklin planner tm software  as well as the introduction of limited edition planners such as the hallmark r and shoebox r planners 
the company also had increased sales from contract stationer channels due to increased demand from new marketing and distribution agreements 
sales from the internet channel have increased due to general changes in consumer buying habits and ongoing enhancements to the company s electronic commerce infrastructure

product sales to the us government continued to be adversely affected by changes in the government procurement process 
sales growth in other distribution channels  including retail stores  contract stationers and the internet  continue to have an adverse affect on catalog sales 
price increases did not have a material effect on sales growth between the periods 
training and education sales increased by million  or  compared to the prior year 
sales increases from premier  personal coaching and direct product channels were partially offset by sales decreases in core training programs and a decline in book royalties 
premier continues to expand its share of the school agenda market and recognized a increase in sales  primarily from new customers 
new business in both personal coaching and the direct products channel resulted in increased sales during fiscal these increases in training and education sales were partially offset by decreased sales in core training sales  primarily from corporate on site and facilitated programs for leadership training 
in response to disappointing sales performance in core training programs  the company is relocating its sales force to eight regional sales offices 
these sales offices are designed to bring customers and the sales force closer together to achieve deeper market penetration and growth

the company s gross margin was adversely affected during fiscal by inventory write offs  changes in product mix  channel pricing  decreased core training volume and declining book royalties 
the company s product mix continues to be affected by an overall decrease in high margin planner sales and an increase in lower margin technology related product sales 
increased sales from the contract stationer channel also adversely affected gross margin due to contracted pricing terms that have resulted in higher unit sales volume  but at reduced margins 
core training programs offered by the company have gross margins that are generally higher than the company s gross margin on product sales 
continued declining sales of these higher margin programs resulted in a lower total gross margin for the company during fiscal additionally  book royalties received in the prior year reflect the impact of the habits of highly effective families  which was released in fiscal and had declining sales during the year  thus directly impacting the company s gross margin in fiscal operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  to of sales  compared to in the prior year

the company s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklin planners on a calendar year basis
