quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks 
these risks relate to commodity price fluctuations  interest rate changes and fluctuations in the value of the warrants with the put option 
the company is a purchaser of pork and other meat products 
the company buys pork and other meat products based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the operating results of the company are significantly impacted by pork prices 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge pork and other meat products prices 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its debt obligations and temporary cash investments 
interest rate risk is managed through variable rate borrowings with varying maturities 
the company does not use  and has not in the past fiscal year used  any derivative financial instruments relating to the risk associated with changes in interest rates 
the company is required to accrete the value of the warrants and mark to market the estimated fair value of the put option 
any increases to such value would be charged to earnings as additional interest expense 
to the extent of any charges to earnings  any subsequent decreases to the value of the warrants would be added to earnings as additional interest income 
furthermore  any such additional interest expense would not be deductible in the company s federal or state income tax returns and  therefore  would increase the effective income tax rate of the company 
for purposes of these calculations  the fair value of the warrants will be estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
during the year ended december   the company recorded no additional interest expense resulting from the changes in the estimated fair of the warrants 
the company is exposed to credit risk on certain assets  primarily accounts receivable

year the year issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
these two digit computer systems will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
the company has focused on three major areas in conducting an assessment of its year readiness information technology  embedded technology  and third party relationships 
information technology 
the company began its assessment of its year readiness by conducting a review of the computer hardware and software applications which comprise the company s information technology systems 
this review was completed by the end of the third quarter of as a result of this review  the company believes that  with the exception of its potter subsidiary  the information technology being utilized by each of its six operating subsidiaries is year compliant  and the company has received written confirmation of year compliance from its hardware and software vendors 
the company has determined that its potter subsidiary requires the installation of a new data processing system  after which potter will also be year compliant 
the company expects that this installation will be completed in the second quarter of through the end of the  the costs paid to third parties in connection with the company s review of its information technology were approximately  and future estimated expenses are  consisting primarily of the costs associated with the new potter data processing system 
embedded technology 
the next phase of the company s assessment began in the third quarter of and is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of this phase involves an audit of the non information technology systems and embedded technology at its facilities 
the company does not anticipate that the costs paid to third parties in connection with its year efforts in this area will be material 
third party relationships 
the company relies on third party suppliers and vendors for raw materials and other key supplies and services 
the company is also dependent upon its customers for sales and cash flow 
interruption of supplier or vendor operations or customer sales due to a failure of those third parties to be year compliant could adversely affect the company s operations 
the company  however  is not dependent on any particular supplier  vendor or customer with the exception of sam s club  inc  which comprises a significant portion of sales 
the company does not currently have written documentation concerning the year readiness of all its suppliers and customers  but has surveyed the year readiness of suppliers and customers with whom the company has an electronic data interface edi and is awaiting certain responses 
while the company believes that the impact of isolated occurrences resulting from the failure of third parties to be year compliant would not be material  a wide spread year interruption throughout the food industry or a year problem with respect to sam s club  inc  its largest customer  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
contingency plan 
although the company does not currently have a contingency plan for year issues  it does intend to begin developing one in the second quarter of to prepare the company for year interruptions in processing accounting or operational information and the inability of its lenders or other sources of capital and liquidity to make funds available when required
