item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following is management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the twelve months ended july  as you read the material below  we urge you to carefully consider our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
the oak hill transaction 
on august   the company consummated the sale of  shares of its series b convertible exchangeable preferred stock the series b preferred stock to oak hill capital partners  lp and certain related entities oak hill 
the company realized gross proceeds of million on the series b preferred stock sale 
the company used million of the proceeds to reduce indebtedness under its senior credit facility as described below  approximately million of which will be reborrowed and invested in the company s principal real estate development subsidiary  american skiing company resort properties  inc  resort properties 
the remainder of the proceeds were used to pay approximately million in fees and expenses in connection with the series b preferred stock sale and related transactions  and acquire from the company s principal shareholder certain strategic assets and to repay a demand note issued by a subsidiary of the company to the company s principal shareholder  in the aggregate amount of million 
as a result of these transactions  management believes that its current capital resources are sufficient both to fund operations at its resorts and to complete those real estate projects which are currently under construction 
as more fully discussed below  the company s ability to commence and complete new real estate development projects will be dependent upon the company s ability to raise additional capital and resort properties ability to obtain additional non recourse financing 
in connection with the series b preferred stock sale  the company obtained consents from lenders and creditors of the company stating that the series b preferred stock sale would not constitute a change of control under the relevant loan agreements  from the holders of the senior preferred stock of the company approving the issuance of the series b preferred stock and the terms of such stock and from noteholders under the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes due of the company s subsidiary  asc east the indenture  approving the merger of asc east into the company and certain other amendments to the indenture 
in connection with the series b preferred stock sale  the company simplified its capital structure by merging its two principal subsidiaries  asc east and asc west  with and into the parent 
in connection with the merger  the parent assumed all liabilities of asc east and asc west and became the primary obligor under certain credit facilities and under the indenture 
in addition  the then current subsidiaries of the parent and asc west  as well as asc utah  also became additional guarantors under the indenture 
as a result of the merger a asc east is no longer required to file annual reports and make other filings under the regulations of the securities exchange act of  b the company s capital structure has been simplified  which is expected to make it easier to raise capital in the future and administer the operations of the company  c the capital and assets of asc east and its subsidiaries are available to satisfy the obligations of asc west and its subsidiaries under the company s senior credit facility described below  and d the parent and its subsidiaries are now subject to the covenants and other restrictions contained in the indenture 
as a result of the additional guarantee given by certain subsidiaries of the company  the noteholders under the indenture will have priority over the equity holders of the company with respect to any claims made on the assets of those subsidiaries until the obligations under the indenture have been satisfied 
liquidity and capital resources short term 
the company s primary short term liquidity needs are funding seasonal working capital requirements  continuing and completing real estate development projects presently under construction  funding its fiscal capital improvement program and servicing indebtedness 
cash requirements for ski related and real estate development activities are provided by separate sources 
the company s primary sources of liquidity for ski related working capital and ski related capital improvements are cash flow from operations of its non real estate subsidiaries and borrowings under the senior credit facility as hereinafter defined 
real estate development and real estate working capital is funded primarily through i construction financing facilities established for major real estate development projects  ii the expected million equity contribution made available from the proceeds of the series b preferred stock sale and iii through a million term loan facility established through resort properties the resort properties term facility 
these construction financing facilities and resort properties term facility collectively  the real estate facilities are without recourse to the company and its resort operating subsidiaries 
the real estate facilities are collateralized by significant real estate assets of resort properties and its subsidiaries  including  without limitation  the assets and stock of grand summit resort properties  inc gsrp  the company s primary hotel development subsidiary 
as of july   the book value of the total assets that collateralized the real estate facilities  and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  were approximately million 
resort liquidity 
the company established a senior credit facility on november  on october   this senior credit facility was amended  restated and consolidated from two sub facilities totaling million to a single facility totaling million million of which was available for borrowings at october   which includes million the company intends to transfer to resort properties in fiscal the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility in the amount of million and a term facility in the amount of million 
the revolving portion of the senior credit facility matures on may   and the term portion matures on may  the senior credit facility contains restrictions on the payment of dividends by the company on its common stock 
those restrictions prohibit the payment of dividends in excess of of the company s consolidated net income after july   and further prohibit the payment of dividends under any circumstances when the effect of such payment would be to cause the company s debt to ebitda ratio as defined within the credit agreement to exceed to based upon these restrictions as well as additional restrictions discussed below  the company does not expect that it will be able to pay cash dividends on its common stock  senior preferred stock or series b senior preferred stock in the foreseeable future 
the maximum availability under the revolving facility will reduce over the term of the senior credit facility by certain prescribed amounts 
the term facility amortizes at an annual rate of approximately of the principal amount for the first four years with the remaining portion of the principal due in two substantially equal installments in years five and six 
the senior credit facility requires mandatory prepayment of of the company s excess cash flows during any period in which the ratio of the company s total senior debt to ebitda exceeds to in no event  however  will such mandatory prepayments reduce the revolving facility commitment below million 
management does not presently expect to generate excess cash flows  as defined in the senior credit facility  during fiscal or fiscal the senior credit facility contains affirmative  negative and financial covenants customary for this type of credit facility  including maintenance of certain financial ratios 
the senior credit facility is collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company  except its real estate development subsidiaries consisting of resort properties and its subsidiaries  which are not borrowers under the senior credit facility 
the revolving facility is subject to an annual day clean down requirement to an outstanding balance of not more than million  which clean down period must include april of each fiscal year 
based upon historical operations  management presently anticipates that the company will be able to meet the financial covenants of the senior credit facility 
failure to meet one or more of these covenants could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility 
in the event that such default were not waived by the lenders holding a majority of the debt under the senior credit facility  such default would also constitute defaults under one or more of the textron facility  the key facility each as hereinafter defined  the resort properties term facility and the indenture  the consequences of which would likely be material and adverse to the company 
the senior credit facility also places a maximum level of non real estate capital expenditures for fiscal of million exclusive of certain capital expenditures in connection with the sale of the series b preferred stock 
following fiscal  annual resort capital expenditures exclusive of real estate capital expenditures are capped at the lesser of i million or ii the total of consolidated ebitda as defined therein for the four fiscal quarters ended in april of the previous fiscal year less consolidated debt service for the same period 
in addition to the foregoing amounts  the company is permitted to and expects to make capital expenditures of up to million for the purchase and construction of a new gondola at its heavenly resort in lake tahoe  nevada  which the company currently plans to construct during the and fiscal years 
the company intends to use borrowings under the senior credit facility for seasonal working capital needs  certain capital improvements and to build retail and other inventories prior to the start of the ski season 
the company expects to maximize borrowings under the senior credit facility sometime between october and november of during this period  the company historically has had little  if any  borrowing availability under the senior credit facility 
however  as a result of the sale of the series b preferred stock and the resulting paydown in the balance of the revolving portion of the senior credit facility  in fiscal management expects that the company will have significant additional borrowing availability under the senior credit facility during this period 
the company s liquidity is significantly affected by its high leverage 
as a result of its leveraged position  the company will have significant cash requirements to service interest and principal payments on its debt 
consequently  cash availability for working capital needs  capital expenditures and acquisitions is very limited  outside of the availability under the senior credit facility 
furthermore  the senior credit facility and the indenture each contain significant restrictions on the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to obtain additional sources of capital and may affect the company s liquidity 
these restrictions include restrictions on the sale of assets  restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and restrictions on the issuance of preferred stock 
on october   the parent merged with two of its subsidiaries  asc east  inc and asc west  inc 
in connection with this merger  the parent assumed the obligations of asc east  inc under the indenture  and each of the material subsidiaries of asc west  inc granted guarantees to secure the obligations of the parent under the indenture 
each of the material subsidiaries of asc east  inc had previously granted guarantees to secure the obligations under the indenture 
by assuming the obligations of asc east under the indenture  the company removed a significant impediment to the free flow of cash among its subsidiaries and allowed for the consolidation of the senior credit facility 
the assumption also subjects the parent and its subsidiaries  asc utah and the subsidiaries of asc west  inc to the restrictions on dividends  indebtedness  and other covenants contained in the indenture 
management believes that the simplified capital structure which resulted from the merger and the assumption of the indenture obligations will benefit the company as it pursues additional financing or other capital sources 
under the indenture  the company is prohibited from paying cash dividends or making other distributions to its shareholders  except under certain circumstances which are not currently applicable and are not anticipated to be applicable in the foreseeable future 
the company issued million of convertible preferred stock and million of convertible notes in july  to fund development at the canyons 
these securities were converted on november  into mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of the company 
the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is exchangeable at the option of the holder into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of for each common share 
in the event that the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is held to its maturity date of november   the company will be required to pay the holders the face value of million plus dividends in arrears 
so long as the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock remains outstanding  the company may not pay any cash dividends on its common stock or series b preferred stock unless accrued and unpaid dividends on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock have been paid in cash on the most recent due date 
because the company has been accruing unpaid dividends on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  the company is not presently able to pay cash dividends on its common stock or series b preferred stock and management does not expect that the company will have this ability in the near future 
real estate liquidity interim funding of working capital for resort properties and its fiscal real estate development program was obtained through a loan from bankboston  na in the maximum amount of million  which closed on september  the bridge loan 
on january   the bridge loan was repaid with proceeds from a term loan facility between bankboston and resort properties in the maximum principal amount of million the resort properties term facility 
the resort properties term facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to bankboston s base rate plus  or a current rate of per annum payable monthly in arrears  and matures on june  as of october   million was outstanding under the resort properties term facility 
the resort properties term facility is collateralized by security interests in  and mortgages on  substantially all of resort properties assets  which primarily consist of undeveloped real property and the stock of its real estate development subsidiaries including gsrp 
as of july   the book value of the total assets that collateralized the resort properties term facility  and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  was approximately million 
the resort properties term facility is non recourse to the company and its resort operating subsidiaries 
in conjunction with the resort properties term facility  resort properties entered into a syndication letter with bankboston the syndication letter pursuant to which bankboston agreed to syndicate up to million of the resort properties term facility 
under the terms of the syndication letter  one or more of the terms of the resort properties term facility excepting certain terms such as the maturity date and commitment fee may be altered depending on the requirements for syndication of the facility 
however  no alteration of the terms of the facility may occur without the consent of resort properties 
although resort properties expects the terms of the resort properties term facility to remain substantially similar to those discussed above  one or more of such terms could be altered in order to syndicate the facility  and such alterations could be material and adverse to the company 
as of october   bankboston was actively engaged in syndicating the resort properties term facility  however  no syndication participants were committed as of that date 
the syndication letter also provides that  in the event that bankboston is unable to syndicate at least million of the resort properties term facility  then bankboston may at its option  require repayment of the outstanding balance of the facility within days of its request for repayment by resort properties if the syndication is unsuccessful and bankboston were to require repayment  there can be no assurance that the company could secure replacement financing for the resort properties term facility 
the failure to secure replacement financing on terms similar to those existing under the resort properties term facility could result in a material adverse effect on the liquidity of resort properties and its subsidiaries  including gsrp  and could also result in a default under the indenture and the senior credit facility 
the company runs substantially all of its real estate development through single purpose subsidiaries  each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of resort properties 
in its fourth fiscal quarter of  the company commenced construction on three new hotel projects two at the canyons in utah and one at steamboat in colorado 
two of these new hotel projects are grand summit hotels which are being constructed by gsrp 
the grand summit hotels at the canyons and steamboat are being financed through a construction loan facility among gsrp and various lenders  including tfc textron financial  the syndication agent and administrative agent  which closed on september  the textron facility 
as of october   the amount outstanding under the textron facility was million 
the textron facility matures on september  and bears interest at the rate of prime plus per annum 
the principal of the textron facility is payable incrementally as quartershare sales are closed based on a predetermined per unit amount  which approximates of the net proceeds of each closing 
the textron facility is collateralized by mortgages against the project sites including the completed grand summit hotels at killington  mt 
snow  sunday river and attitash bear peak  and is subject to covenants  representations and warranties customary for this type of construction facility 
the textron facility is non recourse to the company and its resort operating subsidiaries although it is collateralized by substantial assets of gsrp  million as of july  which comprise substantial assets of the company 
the remaining hotel project commenced by the company in  the sundial lodge project at the canyons  is being financed through a construction loan facility between canyons resort properties  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of resort properties and keybank  na the key facility 
the key facility has a maximum principal amount of million  bears interest at a rate of prime plus per annum payable monthly in arrears  and matures on june  additional costs approximately million for the sundial lodge project have been financed through proceeds of the resort properties term facility  which have been loaned on an intercompany basis by resort properties to canyons resort properties  inc the key facility closed on december  the company began drawing under the key facility in late april of  following completion of the required equity contribution approximately million of the company in the sundial lodge project 
the company had million in advances outstanding under the key facility as of october  the key facility is collateralized by a mortgage and security interest in the sundial lodge project  a million payment guaranty of resort properties  and a full completion guaranty of resort properties 
the key facility is non recourse to the company and its resort operating subsidiaries although it is collateralized by substantial assets of resort properties and its subsidiaries 
as of july   the book value of the total assets that collateralized the real estate facilities  and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  were approximately million 
long term 
the company s primary long term liquidity needs are to fund skiing related capital improvements at certain of its resorts and development of its slope side real estate 
the company has invested over million in skiing related facilities in fiscal years and combined 
as a result  the company expects its resort capital programs for the next several fiscal years will be more limited in size 
the company s fiscal resort capital program is estimated at approximately million  plus such additional amounts as are expended on the heavenly gondola project 
the company s largest long term capital needs relate to certain resort capital expenditure projects and the company s real estate development program 
for the next two fiscal years  the company anticipates its annual maintenance capital needs to be approximately million 
there is a considerable degree of flexibility in the timing and  to a lesser degree  scope of the company s growth capital program 
although specific capital expenditures can be deferred for extended periods  continued growth of skier visits  revenues and profitability will require continued capital investment in on mountain improvements 
the company s practice is to finance on mountain capital improvements through resort cash flow and its senior credit facility 
the size and scope of the capital improvement program will generally be determined annually depending upon future availability of cash flow from each season s resort operations and future borrowing availability and covenant restrictions under the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility places a maximum level of non real estate capital expenditures for fiscal and beyond at the lesser of i million or ii the total of a consolidated ebitda as defined therein for the four fiscal quarters ended in april of the previous fiscal year less b consolidated debt service for the same period 
management believes that these capital expenditure amounts will be sufficient to meet the company s needs for non real estate capital expenditures for the near future 
the company s business plan anticipates the development of both grand summit hotels and condominium hotels at several resorts  as well as resort villages at sunday river  killington  the canyons  steamboat and heavenly 
the timing and extent of these projects are subject to local and state permitting requirements which may be beyond the company s control  as well as to the company s cash flow requirements and availability of external capital 
substantially all of the company s real estate development is undertaken through the company s real estate development subsidiary  resort properties 
recourse on indebtedness incurred to finance this real estate development is limited to resort properties and or its subsidiaries including gsrp 
such indebtedness is generally collateralized by the projects financed under the particular indebtedness which  in some cases  constitutes a significant portion of the assets of the company 
as of july   the total assets that collateralized the real estate facilities  and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  totaled approximately million 
resort properties seven existing development projects are currently being funded by the resort properties term facility  the textron facility and the key facility 
the company expects to undertake future real estate development projects through special purpose subsidiaries with financing provided principally on a non recourse basis to the company and its resort operating subsidiaries 
although this financing is expected to be non recourse to the company and its resort subsidiaries  it will likely be collateralized by existing and future real estate projects of the company which may constitute significant assets of the company 
required equity contributions for these projects must be generated before those projects can be undertaken  and the projects are subject to mandatory pre sale requirements under the resort properties term facility 
potential sources of equity contributions include sales proceeds from existing real estate projects and assets  to the extent not applied to the repayment of indebtedness and potential sales of equity interests in resort properties and or its real estate development subsidiaries 
financing commitments for future real estate development do not currently exist  and no assurance can be given that they will be available on satisfactory terms 
the company will be required to establish both equity sources and construction facilities or other financing arrangements for these projects before undertaking each development 
the company from time to time considers potential acquisitions which  based upon the historical performance of the target entities  are expected to be accretive to earnings 
there are not currently any funding sources immediately available to the company for such acquisitions 
the company would need to establish such sources prior to consummating any such acquisition 
results of operations of the company the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data of the company as a percentage of revenues 
fiscal year ended july  july  july  net revenues resort real estate total net revenues operating expenses resort real estate marketing  general and administrative stock compensation charge depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense loss before benefit from income taxes and minority interest in loss of subsidiary benefit from income taxes minority interest in loss of subsidiary loss before extraordinary items extraordinary loss net loss accretion of discount and dividends accrued on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock net loss available to common shareholders fiscal year ended july  fiscal versus fiscal year ended july  fiscal the actual results of fiscal versus the actual results of fiscal discussed below are not comparable due to the acquisition of the steamboat and heavenly resorts on november  accordingly  the usefulness of the comparisons presented below is limited  as the fiscal results include the results of steamboat and heavenly since november   while the fiscal results include all twelve months of results of steamboat and heavenly 
the following table illustrates the pro forma effect of the results of steamboat and heavenly as if the purchase had occurred at the beginning of fiscal actual year pro forma pro forma actual pro forma increase ended effect on year ended year ended decrease year ended july  july  july  july  dollar percent revenue category lift tickets food and beverage retail sales lodging and property skier development golf  summer activities and other total resort revenues cost of resort operations marketing  general and administrative depreciation and amortizaiton resort revenues increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the pro forma effect of the inclusion of the results from steamboat and heavenly resorts for the first fiscal quarter of accounts for million of the increase 
the remaining million increase in resort revenues is broken out by revenue category in the above table 
the decrease in lift ticket revenues is derived from two factors a decrease in skier visits  due to unfavorable weather conditions in new england and colorado  resulted in an approximately million decrease in lift ticket revenues  and a increase in lift ticket yield  due mainly to price increases at steamboat and heavenly  offset this decrease by approximately million 
increases in food and beverage and retail sales revenues are primarily attributable to additional food and beverage and retail outlets 
the increase in skier development revenues is mainly associated with a new skier development program instituted in fiscal  which corresponded with the opening of new sprint discovery centers at four of the company s eastern resorts 
the increase in lodging revenue is primarily due to the full year of operations in fiscal of three new grand summit hotels which opened during fiscal one each at killington  mount snow and sunday river 
real estate revenues decreased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is attributable to the substantial revenues recognized in fiscal from closings on pre sold quartershare units at the company s grand summit hotels at killington and mt 
snow  and the jordan grand hotel at sunday river 
these projects were completed during the second and third fiscal quarters of fiscal  and the company realized million in sales revenue from these projects in fiscal for fiscal the company realized million in on going sales of quartershare units 
cost of resort operations increased million or from million to million 
the pro forma effect of the inclusion of the results of steamboat and heavenly resorts for the first fiscal quarter of accounts for million of the increase 
the majority of the remaining increase is attributable to the following a million in lodging costs associated with a full year of operation of three new hotels  b million increase associated with a new skier development program which included the operation of four new sprint discovery centers  c million in food and beverage and retail costs associated with additional outlets and higher sales volume and the liquidation of excess inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal  d million increase in snowmaking due to the lack of natural snow at the company s eastern resorts  e million increase in property taxes due to increased tax rates in vermont and an increased asset base at the canyons  and f million increase in event costs associated with marketing sponsorship 
cost of real estate sold decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is attributable to the substantial cost recognized in the third quarter of fiscal from closings of pre sold quartershare units at the company s grand summit hotels at killington and mt 
snow and the jordan grand hotel at sunday river 
the cost associated with the revenue realized for fiscal year totaled million 
the cost associated with the on going sales of these units in fiscal totaled million 
the million decrease related to sales of quartershare units was offset by other increases  due mainly to the following a million of cost recognized relating to the sale of land which was not of strategic importance to the company s real estate development plan or resort operations  b the write off of million in prepaid advertising and commission charges incurred in generating pre sale contracts  some of which have subsequently expired  for a grand summit hotel at the company s sugarbush resort the timing of development for the sugarbush project is expected to be re evaluated by the company during next year s skiing season  and c million of expenses were incurred during the second quarter of fiscal relating to the company s unsuccessful million bond offering which was undertaken to provide additional financing for the company s real estate projects 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased million or from million to million 
the inclusion of the results of steamboat and heavenly resorts for the first fiscal quarter of accounts for million of the increase 
the majority of the remaining increase is attributable to the following a a planned increase in marketing expense at all the resorts of million  b a stock compensation charge of million relating to the vesting of additional management stock options  c million of additional expenses resulting from the expansion of management information services  d million of severance payments and restructuring of management compensation  and e additional costs associated with being a public company 
depreciation and amortization increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the inclusion of the steamboat and heavenly resorts for the first fiscal quarter of accounts for million of the increase 
the remaining increase is primarily due to additional depreciation on capital improvements of approximately million made this year 
these increases are slightly offset by the change in the estimated useful lives of certain of the company s ski related assets  which decreased depreciation expense by million 
interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase is principally attributable to increased debt levels associated with financing the company s recent capital improvements and real estate projects 
the benefit for income taxes increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal due to the increase in the loss before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the non recurring stock option compensation charge of million in fiscal  not all of which was deductible for income tax purposes 
accretion of discount and dividends accrued on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock decreased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to million in additional accretion recognized during fiscal relating to a conversion feature on the company s series a exchangeable preferred stock that allowed holders of these securities to convert to shares of the company s common stock at a discount to the company s initial public offering price 
an additional million of the decrease is due to amortization of issuance costs recognized in fiscal related to the company s series a exchangeable preferred stock upon its conversion into mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
these decreases were offset by an increase resulting from the full twelve months accretion for fiscal related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as compared to only nine months in fiscal  and the compounding effect of the dividend accrual 
fiscal year ended july  fiscal versus fiscal year ended july  fiscal the actual results of fiscal versus the actual results of fiscal discussed below are not comparable due to the acquisition of the steamboat and heavenly resorts on november   and the acquisition of the canyons resort in july accordingly  the usefulness of the comparisons presented below is limited  as the fiscal results include the results of steamboat and heavenly since november   while the fiscal results do not include any results for steamboat and heavenly 
likewise  the fiscal results include the results of the canyons for the entire year while the fiscal results do not include any results for the canyons 
resort revenues increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the steamboat and heavenly resorts acquired on november   and the canyons resort acquired in july  accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining million represents an increase of and is principally attributable to increases in skier visits  the acquisition of new retail and food and beverage outlets  the opening of three new hotels  and increased yields per skier visit at the company s pre acquisition group of resorts 
real estate revenues increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is attributable to completion of the company s new quartershare condominium hotels at killington  mount snow and sunday river and closings of quartershare sales at those projects 
cost of resort operations increased million or from million to million 
the acquisition of steamboat  heavenly  and the canyons resorts accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining million represents an increase of and is principally attributable to the increases in skier visits  business volume  and new operations at the company s pre acquisition resorts 
cost of real estate sold increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is attributable principally to increased sales  as outlined above  and to non capitalizeable costs associated with new projects under development at killington  the canyons and steamboat 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased from million to million 
the inclusion of steamboat  heavenly and the canyons accounted for approximately million of this increase 
the remaining million represents a increase attributable to increased costs associated with the establishment of public holding company corporate functions  including legal  accounting  shareholder relations  financial analysis  management information system support functions  corporate marketing initiatives involving the edge card direct to lift and corporate wide sponsorship programs 
the company incurred a stock compensation charge of million in fiscal associated with the grant of non qualified stock options to certain key members of senior management 
depreciation and amortization increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is principally attributable to the acquisitions of steamboat  heavenly and the canyons and the additional plant and equipment related to the summer capital improvement program 
interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase is principally attributable to the company s senior credit facility  which was established contemporaneously with the closing of its initial public offering and the acquisition of steamboat and heavenly on november  the benefit for income taxes decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal due to a decrease in the loss before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the non recurring stock option compensation charge of million  not all of which is deductible for income tax purposes 
the extraordinary loss recorded by the company results from the early retirement of certain indebtedness in conjunction with the company s initial public offering in november   including the company s then existing revolving line of credit  junior subordinated discount notes  and certain indebtedness established upon acquisition of sugarbush 
accretion of discounts and dividends accrued on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of million in fiscal represents the accretion of the exchange feature  the amortization of the issuance costs and the accrual of dividends relating to the series a exchangeable preferred stock prior to its exchange 
the activity in this component for fiscal also includes million of dividends accrued on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock subsequent to its exchange for the series a exchangeable preferred stock on november  year disclosure background 
the year problem is the result of many existing computer programs and embedded chip technologies containing programming code in which calendar year data is abbreviated by using only two digits rather than four to refer to a year 
as a result of this  some of these programs fail to operate or may not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of 
this may cause such software to recognize a date using as the year rather than the year even systems and equipment that are not typically thought of as computer related often contain embedded hardware or software that may improperly understand dates beginning with the year inability of systems to properly recognize the year could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions to operations  including temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
the company has developed a year task force with representation throughout the organization 
the task force has developed a comprehensive strategy to systematically evaluate and update systems as appropriate 
in some cases  no system changes are necessary or the changes have already been made 
in all other cases  modifications are planned to prepare the company s systems to be year compliant by november  the disclosure below addresses the company s year project 
company s state of readiness 
the year project is divided into three initiatives i information technology it systems  ii non it systems and iii related third party providers 
the company has identified the following phases with actual or estimated dates of completion identify an inventory of systems  completed april   gather certificates and warranties from providers  completed april   determine required actions and budgets  completed april   perform remediation and tests expected to be completed by november  and designing contingency and business continuation plans for each company location plans are complete and are expected to be implemented by december  
the following is a summary of the different phases and progress to date for each initiative identified above it systems the company has continuously updated or replaced older technology with more current technology 
as the company has acquired ski resorts  it updated certain technology at these resorts 
the company s main it systems include an enterprise wide client server financial system  an enterprise wide client server ticketing and direct to lift system  a mid range enterprise wide payroll system  various point of sale and property management systems  upgraded personal computers  wide area networking and local area networking 
phases through are complete 
during phase and  the company determined that its sugarloaf and sugarbush resorts had not yet converted to year compliant lodging systems 
the company has subsequently converted these two resorts to year compliant systems 
the company has developed contingency and business contingency plans for its crucial it systems and expects to have these ready for implementation at each company location by december  non it systems internal non it systems are comprised of faxes  copiers  printers  postal systems  security systems  ski lifts  elevators and telecommunication systems 
phases through are complete for all systems except telecommunication 
these systems are expected to be completed by december related third party providers the company has identified its major related third party providers as certain utility providers  employee benefit administrators and supply vendors 
phases through are complete 
phase is expected to be completed by december  actual and anticipated costs 
the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
the estimated total cost of the year project is approximately  this estimate includes information system conversions for year compliant lodging systems at sugarloaf and sugarbush 
the company had planned to update these systems regardless of year issues to standardize systems within the company s resorts 
the total amount expended on the year project through july th  was  as of july   the estimated future costs of the year project are  all of which relate to replacement costs of non compliant it systems 
the anticipated costs related to non it systems is deemed by management to be immaterial 
risks 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the year project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year disclosures should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements
