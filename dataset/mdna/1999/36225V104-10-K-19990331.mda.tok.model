recent accounting pronouncements in june of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 sfas disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas requires disclosure of certain information about operating segments and about products and services  geographic areas in which a company operates  and their major customers 
the required information has been reflected in the company s december  financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas by january  going forward  the company is still evaluating its position with respect to the use of derivative instruments 
year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium yk approaches 
the yk problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram and test systems for yk compliance 
general physics  the company s principal operating subsidiary  has evaluated its computer systems over the past six months and believes that its business applications are yk compliant  except as noted below 
it has also identified various ancillary programs that need to be updated and has contracted with third parties for this work to be completed within the next six months 
it is expected that the cost of these modifications will be approximately  in addition  the information systems and technology management group of general physics is examining their exposure to the yk in other areas of technology 
these areas include telephone and e mail systems  operating systems and applications in free standing personal computers  local area networks and other areas of communication 
a failure of these systems  which may impact the ability of general physics to service their customers could have a material effect on their results of operations 
these issues are being handled by the information and technology team at general physics by identifying the problems and obtaining from vendors and service providers either the necessary modifications to the software or assurances that the systems will not be disrupted 
general physics believes that the cost of the programming and equipment upgrades will not exceed  in addition  certain personal computers and other equipment that is not yk compliant will be upgraded or replaced through general physics normal process of equipment upgrades 
general physics believes that the evaluation and implementation process will be complete no later than the third quarter of over the next year  general physics intends to continue to plan and implement other information technology projects in the ordinary course of business 
general physics expects to finance these expenditures from a combination of working capital and operating leases for a portion of the new computer equipment 
therefore  general physics does not expect the yk issue to have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations 
the other operations of the company  including mxl and the corporate office  will be yk compliant by the second quarter of the company believes only material application that is not yk compliant at this time is mxl s manufacturing system 
mxl anticipates that they will be yk compliant by june  the cost will be approximately  like other companies  the company relies on its customers for revenues and on its vendors for various products and services  these third parties all face the yk issue 
an interruption in the ability of any of them to provide goods or services  or to pay for goods or services provided to them  or an interruption in the business operations of its customers causing a decline in demand for services  could have a material adverse effect on the company in turn 
in addition  the company has significant equity investments which all face the yk issue as well 
an interruption in their ability to operate could cause a significant impact on their market value  which in turn would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in the event of non remediation of the yk issues by the company or certain of its vendors  the worst case scenario would be disruption of the company s operations  possibly impacting the provision of services to customers and the company s ability to bill or collect revenues 
the company s business units are communicating with their principal customers and vendors about their yk readiness  and expect this process to be completed no later than the third quarter of none of the responses received to date suggests that any significant customer or vendor expects the yk issue to cause an interruption in its operations  which would have a material adverse impact on the company 
however  because so many firms are exposed to the risk of failure not only of their own systems  but of the systems of other firms  the ultimate effect of the yk issue is subject to a very high degree of uncertainty 
management believes that the company s efforts to mitigate its yk risks will avoid significant business interruptions 
contingency planning is an ongoing process 
while the company s overall yk contingency plan is now being developed  existing disaster recovery documentation and procedures remain the first line of defense 
some yk specific plans have been developed and are being reviewed and tested 
the principal yk operational contingency plans are expected to be completed and tested by june in addition  there is a risk  the probability of which the company is not in a position to estimate  that the transition to the yk will cause wholesale  perhaps prolonged  failures of electrical generation  banking  telecommunications or transportation systems in the united states or abroad  disrupting the general infrastructure of business and the economy at large 
the effect of such disruptions on the company could be material 
the statements in this section regarding the effect of the yk and the company s responses to it are forward looking statements 
they are based on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable in light of its current knowledge and experience 
a number of contingencies could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
adoption of a common european currency on january   eleven european countries adopted the euro as their common currency 
from that date until january   debtors and creditors may choose to pay or to be paid in euros or in the former national currencies 
on and after january   the former national currencies will cease to be legal tender 
the company is currently reviewing its information technology systems and upgrading them as necessary to ensure that they will be able to convert among the former national currencies and the euro  and process transactions and balances in euros  as required 
the company has sought and received assurances from the financial institutions with which it does business that beginning in they will be capable of receiving deposits and making payments both in euros and in the former national currencies 
the company does not expect that adapting its information technology systems to the euro will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company is also reviewing contracts with customers and vendors calling for payments in currencies that are to be replaced by the euro  and intends to complete in a timely way any required changes to those contracts 
adoption of the euro is likely to have competitive effects in europe  as prices that had been stated in different national currencies become directly comparable to one another 
in addition  the adoption of a common monetary policy throughout the countries adopting the euro can be expected to have an effect on the economy of the region 
these competitive and economic effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and there can be no assurance that they will not have a material effect on the company s business in europe
