item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading national provider of medical transcription services 
our fees are based primarily on contracted rates with our customers 
we recognize revenue when we render services and deliver reports to our customers 
cost of revenue consists of all direct costs associated with providing transcription related services  including payroll  telecommunications  repairs and maintenance  rent and other direct costs 
most of our cost of revenue is variable 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our senior executive management  marketing  accounting  legal and other administrative functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses are mostly fixed  but include certain variable components 
from through  we completed acquisitions 
five acquisitions completed in  including the acquisition of mrc  were accounted for as pooling of interests 
four of these acquisitions were material and  accordingly  we restated our financial statements 
on december   medquist acquired mrc through the issuance of approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
we believe that the mrc acquisition will better enable us to better utilize crucial resources and reduce corporate overhead by combining accounting  legal and human resources 
further  the additional transcriptionists should permit a more efficient workflow and faster customer service 
in  mrc s revenue and operating income  before its restructuring charge  were million and million  or of its revenue 
medquist s operating income  before restating for its pooling of interests acquisitions  was of revenue in we believe that  over time  the operating margins of the combined company will continue to improve and achieve levels comparable to medquist s historical performance as a stand alone company 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of revenue  as restated for our acquisitions accounted for as a pooling of interests year ended december  revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative depreciation amortization of intangible assets transaction costs and restructuring charges operating income interest income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased from million in to million in the million increase as compared to was composed of million from internally generated growth and million from acquisitions accounted for as purchase transactions 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in and was directly related to the increase in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased from in to in due primarily to the improved direct margins of mrc s business in versus selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to increased administrative costs to support the increase in revenue  in addition to increased technology development costs 
this increase was partially offset by decreased marketing costs at mrc 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in the percentage decrease was due primarily to our ability to spread the fixed portion of our overhead over a larger revenue base 
depreciation 
depreciation increased from million in to million in the increase in depreciation was a result of increased capital expenditures to support the growth in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation remained relatively constant at in compared to in amortization 
amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million in the amount in includes amortization of noncompete agreements from prior business acquisitions that were fully amortized in late interest 
we had interest expense of  in and interest income of  in we repaid a significant portion of our debt in and invested our excess cash in transaction costs and restructuring charges 
in  we incurred million of transaction costs associated with pooling of interests business combinations  incurred  of transaction costs related to mrc s terminated initial public offering and recorded a million restructuring charge associated with the mrc acquisition 
as of december   million of transaction costs associated with the pooling of interests acquisitions had been paid  with  included in accrued expenses for payments scheduled to be made in in june  mrc filed a registration statement for an initial public offering that was terminated in september upon signing the merger agreement with the company 
all transaction costs related to mrc s terminated initial public offering were paid in in december  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan associated with the mrc acquisition 
when the board approved the plan  we recorded a million charge  of which million related to non cancelable lease obligations on duplicate facilities  million related to employee severance and million related to contract cancellations and other exit costs 
we expect to complete the restructuring in as of december    of the employee severance and  in other restructuring costs had been paid 
at december   million was included in accrued expenses related to the restructuring 
in  mrc incurred a restructuring charge of million related to the closure and consolidation of less profitable or redundant client service centers and other non recurring acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with mrc s acquisition of medical records corp

interest 
interest expense decreased from million in to  in the decrease in was primarily related to the payment of our senior term loans  reduced borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the payment of the cash portion of the deferred purchase price on may  for our acquisition of transcriptions  ltd 
this deferred purchase price was paid using a portion of the proceeds from our common stock offering 
in we recorded  of non cash imputed interest expense associated with the transcriptions  ltd 
deferred purchase price 
restructuring charges 
mrc incurred restructuring charges of million in and  in these charges were related to the closure and consolidation of less profitable or redundant facilities 
in addition  the restructuring charge included other acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with mrc s acquisition of medical records corp 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents  and no outstanding bank debt 
during  our operating activities provided cash of million and during  our operating activities provided cash of million 
our cash flow from operating activities is generated primarily from our net income before depreciation and amortization  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 
in  the increase in operating cash flow was also affected by increased accrued expenses  primarily related to the restructuring charge 
during  we used cash for investing activities of million  consisting primarily of million of capital expenditures 
in addition  we generated million in cash from sales of short term investments and used million for the acquisition of three transcription businesses accounted for under the purchase method 
in addition  we paid millon to a dissenting shareholder in connection with the signal acquisition

we have a borrowing facility with chase manhattan bank 
the chase facility provides for a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility expiring april  the chase facility bears interest at resetting rates selected by the company from various alternatives 
the interest rate alternatives are either the greater of a prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus  and c the bank s certificate of deposit rate plus  or libor plus 
the chase facility also allows us to finance up to of any acquisitions of companies that are in the business of providing transcriptions related services 
the financing of these acquisitions may be carved out of the chase facility and amortized over five year periods consecutive quarters 
each acquisition term loan that is created would permanently reduce the remaining chase facility commitment by a like amount 
we can use the chase facility for working capital and general corporate purposes 
if any amounts under the chase facility are repaid  other than acquisition term loans  we may reborrow such amounts 
the chase facility includes financial and other covenants applicable to us  including limitations on capital expenditures and dividends 
as of march  we had no outstanding borrowings under the chase facility 
we believe that cash flow generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the chase facility will be sufficient to meet our current working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
in  we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to be consistent with prior years 
year compliance we are aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
we rely on our systems in operating and monitoring all aspects of our business 
we also rely on the external systems of our customers  suppliers  telecommunication carriers  utilities and other organizations with which we do business 
we have approached the year problem in the following manner o assessing  correcting and testing our internal systems  o obtaining assurance or information on the state of year readiness of our material clients and suppliers  and o developing contingency plans  when practical  to address expected year failures 
a discussion of each of these areas follows 
internal systems 
in  we conducted an assessment of our internal systems 
this assessment covered embedded computer chips  computer software  computer hardware  telephones  communications equipment  facsimile equipment  scanners  copiers and voice recording systems which we own and were able to identify as critical to our ability to provide services to our clients 
the assessment identified a variety of software and hardware issues that we needed to address to be prepared for some of these issues include the need to o upgrade or modify the bios programs which allow personal computers to run on some of our pcs or replace the pc  o modify some of our server operating systems  o reset the dates or modify some of our voice capture systems  o modify the date fields of some of our interfaces  o upgrade the version level of the transcription software of some of our users and clients  o accelerate the conversion of some clients from outdated software applications to compliant software applications  and o upgrade some of the financial systems 
june  is our internal target for rectifying year issues for all mission critical applications 
from july to december   we plan to retest critical systems and evaluate non critical applications for potential year compliance issues 
clients and suppliers 
we also have exposure to year problems that may be experienced by others 
these risks include the inability to exchange electronic data and the risk of disruptions and failures of persons with whom we do business or on whom we or our clients rely 
our business interacts with or depends on the systems of clients  suppliers  telecommunication carriers  utilities  vendors  financial institutions and others 
if we are not able to exchange information electronically with our clients and transcriptionists our business may be materially impacted 
for example  our business relies heavily on telephone services 
if phone service is lost  we will be unable to provide services until phone service is restored or contingency plans can be put in place 
if our clients  suppliers  vendors and financial institutions are not year compliant  there may be a material disruption to their businesses 
these disruptions could negatively impact us in many ways  including o a client may be unable to pay us  o a financial institution may be unable to process checks drawn on our bank accounts  accept deposits or process wire transfers  o vendor deliveries of computer equipment and other supplies may be delayed or cease  o voice and data connections we use to share information may be interrupted  and o brokers who make a market in our stock may not be able to trade our stock 
this list is not comprehensive 
other interruptions to our normal business activities may occur  the nature and extent of which we cannot foresee 
in an effort to minimize the exposure to such third party year problems  we have initiated a process of obtaining written assurances from these third parties that they will be year compliant 
based on the response we receive from the third parties  we are identifying the associated risks to our business and making necessary changes 
contingency plans 
we are developing year contingency plans where practical 
these plans address alternatives to electronic processing of medical information  payroll  vendor payments  cash receipts from clients and communicating without e mail 
these plans include identifying alternative sources of goods and services and performing certain tasks manually 
for example  these contingency plans include requiring physicians to dictate into hand held devices  delivering tapes from these devices to transcriptionists and printing paper copies of reports to be delivered to clients 
in some situations  however  it is impractical to have an effective contingency plan 
for example  a failure of our primary banking institution may interrupt our cash receipts and our ability to pay our employees and vendors in a timely manner 
our contingency plan may call for paying employees in cash  but may not be practical due to the amount of cash involved  the number of locations and the number of individuals to be paid 
the number of year failures we suffer may exceed our ability to address them all at one time 
in addition  significant year failures by third parties  including clients  may jeopardize our financial strength 
in severe circumstances  our ability to continue as a going concern may be threatened or we may fail 
we believe  however  that we are taking reasonable and prudent steps to address the year problem based on information currently available to us 
we will continue to monitor this issue and plan to modify our approach if we believe the circumstances warrant such a change 
based on the information available to date  we expect to incur approximately  in expense to correct operational problems such as bios fixes 
we also believe we will incur approximately million to replace and upgrade voice capture systems  which will be capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives of five years 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we generally do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we make investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio at december  for investment securities  the table presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates dollars in thousands 
cash and cash equivalents  average interest rate warrant investment average interest rate total portfolio  weighted average interest rate 
the majority of our debt obligations were repaid in february remaining obligations consist primarily of relatively insignificant capital lease obligations that mature through inflation we believe that the effects of inflation and changing prices generally do not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition
