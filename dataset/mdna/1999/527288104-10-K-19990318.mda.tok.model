the company anticipates that  prior to the date of its annual meeting scheduled for may   its board of directors will declare a dividend in an aggregate amount of approximately  minus amounts paid to repurchase common shares from march  through the date of declaration 
payment of such dividend would require the company to make an offer to purchase all of its outstanding senior subordinated debentures due and its senior subordinated debentures due  outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of  at a purchase price of of principal  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing these debentures 
these offers would be required to be made within five business days after the payment of such dividend  unless the terms of the debentures can be modified on terms that are acceptable to the company

the parent also receives tax sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its consolidated income tax return  including certain regulated subsidiaries 
because of the tax loss carryforwards available to the parent and certain subsidiaries  together with current interest deductions and corporate expenses  the amount paid by the parent for income taxes has been substantially less than tax sharing payments received from its subsidiaries 
payments from regulated subsidiaries for dividends  tax sharing payments and other services totaled approximately  including  relating to the sales of the colonial penn companies in for the year ended december  based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers  the company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities

in september  the company reinsured  retroactive to january   substantially all of its remaining life insurance business to allstate and a subsidiary thereof in an indemnity reinsurance transaction 
while the premium received on this transaction was approximately  the gain on the reinsurance transaction was deferred and is being amortized into income based upon actuarial estimates of the premium revenue of the underlying insurance contracts 
in december  the company signed an agreement to sell its remaining life insurance subsidiaries  charter and intramerica  to allstate for statutory surplus at the date of sale approximately  at december   plus  the transaction is expected to result in a pre tax gain of approximately  principally resulting from recognition of deferred gains from prior reinsurance transactions including the september allstate transaction described above 
the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of as of december   the company s consolidated debt was  as compared to  as of december  this increase is primarily related to the company s acquisition of of fidei in at december   the principal amount of fidei s euro denominated outstanding debt  all of which is non recourse to the company  was approximately  approximately  euros 
inasmuch as fidei s euro demoninated assets will be sold over time and such assets are presently funded with fidei s euro demoninated debt  the company has determined not to acquire a currency hedge for fidei s euro denominated debt 
in  the company formed pib  a joint venture with pepsico  inc  to be the exclusive bottler and distributor of pepsico beverages in a large portion of central and eastern russia  kyrgyzstan and kazakstan 
the company contributed  to pib for a equity interest 
effective as of january   the company entered into an agreement with pepsico  pursuant to which  among other things  pib repaid in full the company s  bridge financing which was funded in and the company s equity interest in pib was reduced to 
the agreement relieved the company of any future funding obligation with respect to pib and created an option  exercisable by either the company or pepsico  pursuant to which pepsico was obligated to purchase all of the company s interest in pib the option for  plus interest 
in february  pepsico exercised the option for approximately  including interest  and the company recognized a pre tax gain of approximately  however  when combined with the company s share of the joint venture losses since inception  the company s net loss from this investment was approximately  the investment portfolios of the company s insurance subsidiaries are principally fixed maturity investments  the balance of their portfolio consists largely of preferred securities 
of the fixed maturity securities  the majority consists of those rated investment grade or us governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations  although limited investments in non rated or rated less than investment grade securities have been made from time to time 
principally as a result of changes in market interest rates during  the unrealized gain on investments at the end of of approximately  net of taxes decreased to an unrealized loss of approximately  net of taxes as of december  while this has resulted in a decrease in shareholders equity  it had no effect on results of operations or cash flows 
the company provides collateralized automobile loans to individuals with poor credit histories 
prior to  the company s loan volume was in decline primarily as a result of heavy competition in this line of business 
however  in  the company began to see growth in its automobile lending business as it expanded into new locations and developed new programs 
the company also benefited from the decline in competition due to the failure of certain competitors and a reduction in capital available for securitizations 
in addition  in december  the company purchased a  sub prime automobile portfolio 
the company s investment in automobile loans was   and  at december   and  respectively 
during  the company s banking and lending subsidiaries sold substantially all of their executive and professional loan portfolios for aggregate proceeds of  and reported a pre tax gain on these sales of approximately  the company and certain of its subsidiaries have loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
the amount and availability of tax loss carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications  limitations and uncertainties 
as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  significant additional amounts of loss carryforwards may be available under certain circumstances 
in order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of these carryforwards  the company s certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating at least five percent of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning at least five percent of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares 
results of operations property and casualty insurance the company s most significant operation is its insurance business  where it is a provider of property and casualty insurance primarily in the new york metropolitan area 
for the year ended december   the company s insurance segment contributed of total revenues from continuing operations and  at december   constituted of total assets 
net earned premium revenues of the empire group were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  the decrease in earned premium revenues was primarily due to a decline in the number of assigned risk automobile pool contracts acquired due to competition and the depopulation of the assigned risk automobile pools  and a reduction in certain lines  principally voluntary commercial automobile  private passenger automobile  commercial package policies  and workers compensation  due to tighter underwriting standards  reunderwriting and increased competition 
in  the decline in earned premium revenues was primarily due to the depopulation of the assigned risk pools  and a reduction in certain commercial lines  principally voluntary commercial automobile  and workers compensation  due to competition  reunderwriting and repricing 
in addition  earned premium revenues were reduced in by  to record premiums due under retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts written for and prior accident years 
the empire group re estimated the premium due based upon its then current estimate of loss ratios for and prior accident years 
partially offsetting these reductions was an increase in certain voluntary personal lines  principally private passenger automobile and homeowners 
the empire group s combined ratios as determined under gaap and sap were as follows year ended december  gaap sap the empire group s combined ratios increased in primarily due to the reduction in premium volume at a rate greater than the reduction in net underwriting and other costs 
in addition  the reduction in servicing fees in negatively affected the expense ratios 
included in the empire group s results for  and were approximately   and  respectively  for reserve strengthening related to losses from prior accident years 
during  the empire group reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims files  focusing on workers compensation  commercial auto and other commercial liability lines of business 
such reviews are part of the empire group s normal ongoing practice 
particular emphasis during this review was placed on reserves carried for the workers compensation line of business 
as part of the review  substantially all open workers compensation claim files were reviewed for every accident year up to and including the empire group also conducted a comprehensive review of reserves carried for other commercial liability lines of business in which approximately of the open claim files were reviewed  with a primary focus on accident years to as a result of these reviews  the empire group revised its assumptions regarding average claims costs and probable ultimate losses and  accordingly  reserves were strengthened by  for workers compensation and  for other commercial liability lines of business 
additionally  during  the empire group reorganized the commercial auto claims department 
as part of this realignment  more complex claims files were reviewed by the most experienced claims examiners and assumptions regarding average claims severity and probable ultimate losses were revised and reserves were strengthened by  for commercial automobile lines of business 
the reserve strengthening included approximately  for commercial package lines of business and approximately  for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business 
during  the empire group reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims files  as part of its normal ongoing practice  focusing on the commercial package  general liability and commercial automobile lines of business 
as a result of this review and the continued unfavorable development of prior accident years losses  particularly the through accident years  the empire group revised its assumptions regarding future increases in average claims severity and reserves were strengthened 
the reserve strengthening included approximately  for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business and approximately  for commercial package lines of business 
beginning in  the empire group entered into new market segments of the voluntary commercial business  including specialty programs for sanitation trucks  gas stations  fuel oil deliveries and limousines 
initially  the empire group based its loss ratio estimate upon its experience with similar lines of business  industry statistics and standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques  which consider expected loss ratios 
during  claims began to develop unfavorably and the empire group used such claim development to revise the assumptions that formed the basis of actuarial studies and reserves were increased 
with respect to commercial package lines  general liability claims for business written in through also developed unfavorably 
these claims showed an increased frequency of losses as well as an increase in the time between the date the loss occurred and when the loss was reported compared to prior experience 
general liability claims are susceptible to the emergence of losses over an extended period of time 
for the lines of business discussed above  as well as all other property and casualty lines of business  the company employs a variety of standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques  statistical analyses and case basis evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses 
the actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon historical patterns 
these estimates are performed quarterly and consider any changes in trends and actual loss experience 
any resulting change in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses  including those discussed above  is reflected in current year earnings during the quarter the change in estimate is identified 
the reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past experience is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
the probable effects of current developments  trends and other relevant matters are also considered 
since the establishment of loss reserves is affected by many factors  some of which are outside the company s control or affected by future conditions  reserving for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process requiring the use of informed estimates and judgements 
as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  the company s estimates and judgements may be revised 
while the effect of any such changes in estimates could be material to future results of operations  the company does not expect such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
in management s judgment  information currently available has been appropriately considered in estimating the company s loss reserves 
the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves on a quarterly basis  incorporating any future changes in trends and actual loss experience  and record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate 
manufacturing in december  the company completed the disposition of certain of its manufacturing operations 
as a result  since december  the company s manufacturing operations solely have consisted of its plastics division 
in  the gross profit for the plastics division increased by to approximately  this increase was primarily due to greater sales in most of the division s product lines and lower raw material costs 
the decline in manufacturing revenues during the last three years was due to the sale of certain divisions and the discontinuance of certain non performing product lines in and prior years 
the company recorded charges of  in and  in for losses on sales and shutdown expenses  which are primarily reflected in the caption selling  general and other expenses 
banking and lending finance revenues and operating profits reflect the level of consumer instalment loans  and for  the sale of substantially all of the company s executive and professional loan portfolio which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately  as discussed above 
in addition  automobile loan losses declined in and in  operating profit was also adversely affected by  in costs to settle litigation related to a lending program that is in liquidation 
in  operating profit was also affected by increased interest expense on customer banking deposits 
other in  investment and other income increased by approximately  primarily due to increased interest income  the sale of the company s executive and professional loan portfolio referred to above  and increased income from real estate activities  partially offset by reduced gains from sales of real estate and other assets  and reduced income relating to the service business 
in  investment and other income increased by approximately  primarily due to increased gains from sales of real estate properties  including the sale of a new york city office building and increased interest income  including earnings on the proceeds from the sales of the colonial penn life group and colonial penn p c group 
such increases were partially offset by reduced trading stamp and miscellaneous other revenues in and a litigation settlement gain recorded in during  due to declines in values that were deemed other than temporary  the company recorded a pre tax writedown of approximately  related to its investments in russian and polish debt and equity securities 
such writedowns are reflected in the caption net securities gains losses 
at december   the remaining book value of the company s investments in these debt and equity securities was approximately  equity in income losses of associated companies improved in as compared to primarily due to a reduction of approximately  in the company s equity losses related to pib resulting from discontinuance of the equity method of accounting in early and income from an investment partnership of approximately  in december  the company invested  to acquire a limited partnership interest in this partnership 
the partnership currently is in the process of liquidating and making final distributions 
the company does not anticipate that the amount of income to be realized from this investment will be significant in equity in losses of associated companies increased in as compared to primarily due to start up losses from the company s equity investment in pib of  in as compared to  in the equity in losses of associated companies included losses from the company s investment in mk gold of  in and  in and a write off of  in  representing the company s investment in an unsuccessful well drilled by its siberian oil exploration joint venture 
interest expense primarily reflects the level of external borrowings outstanding throughout the periods 
the reduction in interest expense in was primarily due to the decline in such borrowings 
the decrease in selling  general and other expenses in as compared to principally reflects decreased expenses of the manufacturing segment principally as a result of the sale of certain divisions in  decreased pension expense due to the recognition of net curtailment gains of  a charge for estimated costs to settle litigation relating to a lending program that is in liquidation and lower provisions for bad debts 
the decrease in selling  general and other expenses in as compared to principally reflects the empire group s decreased expenses related to reduced premium volume  decreased operating expenses of real estate properties  decreased expenses relating to certain investment activities and lower provisions for bad debts 
this decrease was partially offset by the losses recorded by the manufacturing segment related to sold divisions and the charge for estimated costs to settle litigation relating to a lending program that is in liquidation 
income taxes for reflect a benefit of approximately  for a change in the company s estimated federal tax liability and the favorable resolution of certain contingencies 
the and income tax benefits were greater than the expected normal corporate tax rate primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain contingencies 
as discussed above  in december  the company signed an agreement to sell its remaining life insurance subsidiaries  charter and intramerica  to allstate 
the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of in  the company classified these life insurance operations as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been restated to be consistent with such presentation 
the number of shares used to calculate basic earnings loss per share was   and  for  and  respectively 
the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings loss per share was   and  for  and  respectively 
for diluted per share amounts  the company s convertible subordinated debentures due which were redeemed in were not assumed to have been converted since the effect of such assumed conversion would have been to increase earnings per share 
year and information technology systems the company is in the process of evaluating its information technology systems to determine the potential impact of the year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
as a result  before the end of  computer hardware and software may need to be upgraded with new hardware and software which can distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
since  the company has been evaluating its year readiness 
its program to address its year readiness consists of i the preparation of an inventory of all computer related hardware and software  all non computer related hardware that may have embedded technology and all third parties that are material to the company s business operations  ii the identification of a senior officer at each of the company s operating subsidiaries and significant investments to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the year program and reporting on compliance therewith to the company s senior management  iii the identification of mission critical aspects of the company s business  and assessment of the year readiness of such mission critical systems and components  iv the development of a plan to upgrade  repair or replace systems as required for year compliance  v the development of a plan to test the readiness of all critical systems  vi making inquiry of material third parties as to the state of their year compliance  and vii as appropriate  the development of a contingency plan for either non compliant internal systems or non compliant material third parties 
where appropriate  outside consultants have been engaged to advise the company on its year readiness 
substantially all of the company s operations have completed the inventory and identification process and are in the process of upgrading and testing critical systems 
the company s primary focus during the balance of will be on continued testing of mission critical systems and software provider upgrades  as well as monitoring the readiness of material third parties 
in  the empire group began to evaluate its information technology systems and their ability to support future business needs 
this led to a decision to acquire new policy management and accounting systems 
these systems provide enhanced functionality and improved processing for underwriting  claims  billing  collection  reinsurance  reporting and accounting and are designed to be year compliant 
the empire group anticipates that these new systems will be fully implemented in and that any non compliant programs will become compliant during all but one of the manufacturing operation s material systems involving the storage of historical information have tested as being year compliant 
the company is exploring alternative systems to maintain this information 
until an acceptable replacement for this system can be found  the company can maintain these records in hard copy 
the banking and lending operations have successfully completed testing of mission critical systems and testing of non mission critical systems is currently underway 
in addition  deposit customers have been sent letters to inform them about the year issue and to educate them about the progress made in addressing this issue 
the year issue may affect other entities with which the company transacts business 
the company has made inquiry of third parties with whom it has material relationships as to the year compliance of such third parties 
many of such parties have reported plans to be fully compliant by the end of and most have reported substantial progress at the end of however  at this time the company cannot predict the effect of the year on its material third parties or the impact any deficiency in the year readiness of such parties could have on the company 
through december   expenses incurred by the company in connection with the year issue excluding expenses related to the empire group s acquisition of new systems  which was not motivated by year concerns did not exceed  based upon current information  the company does not expect that the year issue will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio  its borrowing activities and the banking and lending activities of certain subsidiaries 
the company does not enter into material derivative financial instrument transactions 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale  and consequently  is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders equity 
included in the company s investment portfolio are fixed income securities  which comprised approximately of the company s total investment portfolio at december  these fixed income securities are primarily rated investment grade or are us governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations  although limited investments in non rated or rated less than investment grade securities have been made from time to time 
the estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately years at december  the company s fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
at december   the company s portfolio of trading securities was not material 
the company manages the investment portfolio of its insurance subsidiaries to preserve principal  maintain a high level of quality  comply with applicable insurance industry regulations and achieve an acceptable rate of return 
in addition  the company considers the duration of its insurance reserves in comparison with that of its investments 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt and the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of its subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of the company 
generally  the fair market value of debt and preferred securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall  and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise 
the company s banking and lending operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  mature or reprice in specified periods 
the principal objectives of the company s banking and lending asset liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate funding needs 
the company utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present 
the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the ensuing twelve month period 
derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  may be used to modify the company s indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on risk management policies and the company s current economic outlook 
counterparties to such agreements are major financial institutions  which the company believes are able to fulfill their obligations  however  if they are not  the company believes that any losses are unlikely to be material 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for investment securities and debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates 
for the variable rate notes receivable and variable rate borrowings  the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
for loans  securities and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the company s historical experience of loan prepayments and prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
for banking and lending s variable rate products  the weighted average variable rates are based upon the respective pricing index at the reporting date
