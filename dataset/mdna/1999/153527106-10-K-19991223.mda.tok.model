see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein for a discussion of sales fluctuations related to internal growth and business acquisitions for fiscal years  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview from october  to september   distribution distributed solaris product nationwide  pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement 
management believes that the relationship with solaris embodied in the solaris agreement had a substantial impact on our results of operations 
sales of products purchased from solaris  our largest supplier  accounted for approximately of distribution s net sales and of central s net sales during fiscal and of distribution s net sales and of central s net sales during fiscal under the solaris agreement  distribution  in addition to serving as the master agent and master distributor of solaris products  provided a wide range of value added services including logistics  order processing and fulfillment  inventory distribution and merchandising 
as a result of the solaris agreement  a majority of our sales of solaris products were derived from servicing direct sales accounts  whereas in and prior  a majority of our sales of solaris products were made by us as a traditional distributor 
under the solaris agreement  our inventories of solaris product increased significantly  since we not only carried inventories to support our own sales of solaris products but also certain inventory previously carried by solaris as well as additional inventories to support sales of solaris products by our former network of independent distributors 
in january  monsanto sold its solaris lawn and garden business exclusive of its roundup r herbicide products for consumer use to scotts and entered into a separate  long term  exclusive agreement pursuant to which monsanto continues to make roundup herbicide products for consumer use and scotts markets the products 
scotts has been for many years a substantial supplier to us and  in connection with its direct sales  a substantial purchaser of our services 
scotts has altered its distribution systems for certain products  including ortho r and miracle gro r products and monsanto s consumer roundup products for which scotts acts as monsanto s exclusive sales agent 
beginning october   scotts began to distribute ortho and roundup products through a system that involves a combination of distributors  of which we are the largest  as well as through direct sales by scotts to certain major retailers 
in addition  scotts has begun to sell miracle gro directly to certain retailers 
we believe that the business likely to be taken over in this fiscal year ending september  by scotts is estimated to be approximately million in sales 
the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was approximately million 
we expect this loss of gross profit to be partially offset this fiscal year with expense reductions and other business growth 
however  there is no assurance that the business taken over by scotts will not be greater than million or that we will be successful in our attempts to reduce expenses and generate new business 
due to the changes in scotts distribution system  our inventory of scotts products and the related payables are likely to be reduced by an amount that is estimated to be in excess of million 
additionally  we have taken actions to realign our lawn and garden distribution operations to reflect business levels for fiscal as a result  we have recorded charges of million in the fiscal year ending september  these charges related principally to the closing of three distribution centers and work force reductions as well as charges to reduce the carrying value of inventory to be returned to solaris to its estimated net realizable value  and to establish a reserve for estimated non collectable amounts due from distributors involved in the solaris program 
the amount and profitability of distribution s business with scotts in fiscal and in future years  if any  may be influenced by numerous factors and is impossible to predict 
accordingly  the actual results of our operations may differ significantly from the foregoing estimates 
the sale of the solaris business by monsanto and the expiration of the solaris agreement subject our distribution business to significant uncertainties 
these include our new relationship with scotts and the resolution of all payments due between us and monsanto under the solaris agreement  such as the amounts receivable from monsanto for cost reimbursements  payments for cost reductions and payments for services  the amounts payable to monsanto for inventory  and responsibility for obsolete inventory and for non payment by solaris sub agents 
the resolution of these uncertainties may involve litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales fiscal year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other charges income from operations interest expense net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for the year ended september  increased by or million to  million from  million for the year ended september  of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to businesses acquired 
of the increase related to our existing business  approximately million was attributable to distribution  million to garden products and a decrease of million was attributable to pet products 
gross profit increased by or million from million during the year ended september  to million for the comparable period 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from for fiscal to for fiscal while gross profit from existing operations increased compared with  approximately million of the increase related to acquired operations 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is the result of a larger proportion of garden products and pet products sales relative to total sales in fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended september   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million from million for the year ended september   an increase of 
of the million increase  approximately million related to newly acquired operations 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal of the million increase related to our existing business  approximately million is the result of increased sales volume in fiscal the balance of the increase is attributable to million related to the expanded use of common freight carriers  additional sales and service personnel and increased facilities costs within distribution  million related to product development and packaging design and testing for both pet products and garden products  million related to computer conversion costs for certain older systems acquired in acquisitions  and expanded use of data communication lines to link all our computer systems  million increase in goodwill amortization  and approximately million related to increased medical insurance  legal and professional  and personnel costs 
for the year ended september   the company recorded other charges totaling million 
million of these charges related to the resizing of our distribution operations and costs associated with the expiration of the solaris agreement 
the resizing of our distribution operations was made to reflect the fact that our sales volume of solaris products in fiscal will be reduced from the volume in fiscal by an estimated million 
in order to minimize the impact of this loss of revenue  the company has initiated plans to close its distribution centers located in visalia  california  mcalester  oklahoma  and albuquerque  new mexico 
customers primarily serviced by these locations have been assigned to other company facilities 
the remaining million of the charge  is required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to be returned to solaris to its estimated net realizable value  and to establish a reserve for estimated non collectable amounts due from distributors involved in the solaris program 
net interest expense for the year ended september  increased by approximately or million to million for million for the year ended september  the increase is due to higher average outstanding short term debt resulting principally from the company s stock repurchase program and the acquisition in january of norcal pottery 
during fiscal  the company repurchased its stock for a total cost of approximately million primarily through the use of its revolving credit facility 
average short term borrowings for fiscal were million compared with million for fiscal the average short term interest rates for the years ended september  and september  were and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate for was compared with for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate results principally from non deductible goodwill expense being a higher percentage of taxable income than was the case in fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for the year ended september  increased by or million to  million from million for the year ended september  of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to businesses acquired 
the increase related to existing business was attributable principally to distribution with modest increases in garden products and pet products 
gross profit increased by or million from million during the year ended september  to million for the comparable period 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from for fiscal year to for fiscal year while gross profit from existing operations increased compared with  a substantial portion of the total increase relates to newly acquired businesses 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is due principally to a larger proportion of higher margin branded product sales relative to total sales in fiscal the change in sales mix is primarily attributed to businesses acquired since october for the year ended september   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million from million for the year ended september  of the million increase  approximately million is attributable to newly acquired businesses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in this percentage increase relates to the garden products and pet products businesses acquired during fiscal these types of businesses have significantly higher operating costs as a percentage of sales than distribution 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales from existing operations decreased slightly from for fiscal to for fiscal year as branded products become a greater percentage of total sales  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales should continue to increase 
for the year ended september   the company recorded other charges totaling million 
these charges related principally to the closure of of the company s branch locations and costs associated with professional and due diligence expenses principally related to a potential major acquisition that was not completed 
of the operations which were closed  seven were related to distribution s pet supplies business  five in the western us and two in the northeast market 
the closure and consolidation of these operations into other existing branches was principally due to the acquisition of regional pet retailers by two major pet retailers  and in the northeast market the decision by one major retailer to purchase a larger percentage of their products either directly from manufacturers into its retail store locations or distribute these products through internal distribution centers 
as a result of these actions  the overall market for the company s pet supplies business in these geographic areas was reduced 
the costs to realign and integrate the affected operations amounted to approximately million 
the company believes that the closure of these locations will enable it to serve its customer base more cost effectively 
the closure of two of the company s southern california distribution branches was done in conjunction with the transfer of certain business previously shipped from the company s central california facility 
the operations of these three branches were consolidated into a larger existing facility in southern california 
the company believes that the move will reduce shipping costs within california while at the same time provide better service to its customers 
the remaining branches which were closed related to the company s vegetable seed distribution operation in celaya  mexico  and the consolidation of the pennington seed operation in arkansas into the company s branch in arkansas 
the celaya branch was part of a larger acquisition made by the company several years ago 
since the sale of vegetable seed has never been part of the company s core business and revenues have remained modest with little growth potential  the company elected to exit this business 
net interest expense for the year ended september  increased by or million to million from million for the year ended september  the increase is due to higher average outstanding debt principally related to debt assumed on the businesses acquired since october  offset in part by an increase in interest income 
interest income was earned from funds available as a result of the public offering of the company s common stock completed in january substantially all of these funds have been used to acquire businesses during fiscal average short term borrowings for fiscal were million compared with million for fiscal the average interest rates for the fiscal years ended september  and september  were and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate was for both fiscal years 
impact of year state of readiness 
in early  central conducted an overall assessment of its systems  including year readiness 
based on this assessment  central developed a plan to deal with year issues  which covered both systems and vendor customer issues 
the plan included both upgrades to or replacement of current systems to bring all of central s systems into compliance 
many of the existing information systems used by subsidiaries or divisions acquired by central were replaced  primarily for business reasons apart from year issues 
central has used primarily internal resources to reprogram or replace and test its systems for year compliance 
in addition  central has used certain external resources to replace outdated information systems at certain of its subsidiaries operations 
these systems changes were completed during fiscal the plan developed to address vendor and customer issues included systems integration  testing and communication strategies 
central has sent confirmations and discussed year readiness with its significant vendors and customers to determine the extent to which it may be vulnerable to a failure by any of these third parties to remediate their own year issues 
central has tested electronic data transmissions to and from its major vendors and customers to ensure year compliance 
in addition to vendors and customers  central also relies upon governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunication service companies and other service providers outside of central s control 
nothing has come to the company s attention that would indicate a year problem which would affect the company  however  there can be no assurance that central s vendors or customers  governmental agencies or other third parties will not suffer a year business disruption that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
costs to address the year issue 
to date  central has incurred no significant incremental costs addressing year issues  although it has incurred costs  independent of the year issue  relating to the implementation of new systems for certain subsidiaries 
central has no separate budget for year issues  and expenditures relating to the year issues have not been material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
risks presented by the year issue 
the company believes that the most likely risks of serious year business disruptions are external in nature  such as i disruptions in telecommunications  electric  or transportation services  ii failure by third parties to provide goods or services essential to the company s business activities and iii noncompliance of smaller trading partners 
of all the external risks  the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be a business disruption resulting from an extended and or extensive communications failure 
with its extensive use of technology  the company is now dependent on data and voice communications to receive  process  track and bill customers orders  move funds  replenish product and complete other activities critical to the company s business 
based on the company s information regarding the readiness of its major communications carriers  as well as the company s developing contingency plans  the company expects that any such disruption would be likely to be localized and of short duration  and would therefore not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
contingency plans 
central s year plan includes contingency plans in the events that central s computer systems experience unforeseen problems relating to the year issue or any third parties who provide goods or services essential to central s business fail to appropriately address their year issues 
these contingency plans include alternative electronic and manual means for placing and receiving orders  and alternative power supplies and communication lines  as well as having qualified computer professionals on hour a day stand by during the period from december  through january  inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  the company believes that the effects of inflation on its operations have been immaterial 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth through a combination of bank borrowings  supplier credit  internally generated funds and sales of securities to the public 
the company received net proceeds after offering expenses of approximately million from its five public offerings of common stock in july  november  july  august and january in november  the company completed the sale of million subordinated convertible notes generating approximately million net of underwriting commissions 
the company s business is highly seasonal and its working capital requirements and capital resources track closely to this seasonal pattern 
during the first fiscal quarter accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory  accounts payable and short term borrowings increase 
since the company s short term credit line fluctuates based upon a specified asset borrowing base  this quarter is typically the period when the asset borrowing base is at its lowest and consequently the company s ability to borrow is at its lowest 
during the second fiscal quarter  receivables  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase  reflecting the build up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak selling season 
during the third fiscal quarter  principally due to the solaris agreement  inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  inventory levels are at their lowest  and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash 
for the year ended september   the company generated cash from operating activities of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million resulted from acquisitions and additions to plant and equipment 
cash used by financing activities was million and related principally to the repurchase of the company s stock in the amount of million  and was primarily financed by short term borrowings of million 
additionally  million was received from the exercise of stock options and shares purchased under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the company has a million line of credit with congress financial corporation western 
the available amount under the line of credit fluctuates based upon a specific asset borrowing base 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate per annum  and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at september   the company had million of outstanding borrowings and had million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
the company s line of credit contains certain financial covenants such as minimum net worth and minimum working capital requirements 
the line also requires the lender s prior written consent to any acquisition of a business and includes a ceiling on the dollar amount the company can utilize to reacquire company stock 
in connection with the acquisition of one company in fiscal  the company assumed a million line of credit  of which approximately million was available at september  interest related to this line is based on a rate either equal to the prime rate or libor plus 
at the company s option 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  funds available under its lines of credit and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund its presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures will not exceed million for the next months 
as part of its growth strategy  the company has engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies in the past and it anticipates it will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
if one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  become available in the near future  the company may require additional external capital 
in addition  such acquisitions would subject the company to the general risks associated with acquiring companies  particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large 
weather and seasonality historically  the company s sales of lawn and garden products have been influenced by weather and climate conditions in the markets it serves 
for example  during the first six months of both and and the first three months of the calendar year in  the company s results of operations were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in many parts of the country 
additionally  the company s business is highly seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s sales occurred in the first six months of the calendar year 
substantially all of the company s operating income is typically generated in this period which has historically offset the operating losses incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year 
risk factors relating to forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include information regarding future financial results  the estimated effect of the termination of the solaris agreement and future acquisition activity 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors both in and out of our control  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 
you should carefully consider the risks described below 
we have separated the risks into four groups 
risks that relate to garden products  
risks that relate to distribution  
risks that relate to pet products  and 
risks that relate to central generally 
in addition  the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
we have only described the risks we consider to be the most material 
however  there may be additional risks that are viewed by us as not material or are not presently known to us 
if any of the events described below were to occur  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
when we say below that something could or will have a material adverse effect on us  we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects 
in any such case  the price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment in our company 
risks relating to garden products adverse weather during the peak gardening season can hurt garden products and our net sales 
because demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather  particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season  our results of operations could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures  water shortages or floods 
during the last several years  our results of operations were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in some parts of the country 
additionally  our business is highly seasonal  with approximately of our sales in fiscal occurring during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
historically  substantially all of our operating income is generated in this period 
an increase in market prices for grains used to produce bird seed and grass seed could have a negative impact on our operating income 
garden products financial results depend to a large extent on the cost of raw materials and the ability of garden products to pass along to its customers increases in these costs 
in particular  our pennington subsidiary is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for commodity grains  used to produce bird seed and grass seed 
historically  market prices for commodity grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors  including changes in united states government farm support programs  changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons 
in the event of any increases in raw materials costs  garden products would be required to increase sales prices for its products in order to avoid margin deterioration 
there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of garden products ability to implement future price adjustments in the event of increased raw material costs or as to whether any price increases implemented by garden products may affect the volumes of future shipments 
to protect against changes in market prices  we enter into purchase contracts for grains  bird seed and grass seed to cover approximately one third of the purchase requirements for a selling season 
since we hedge only a portion of our purchase requirements  if market prices for grains increase  our cost of production would increase 
garden products depends on a few customers  including wal mart and lowes  for a significant portion of its net sales 
garden products largest customer is wal mart  which accounted for approximately and of its net sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
garden products second largest customer is lowes  which accounted for approximately and of its net sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  the relationship between us and wal mart or lowes could cause our net sales and income from operations to decline 
the loss of or reduction in orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could reduce our income from operations 
risks relating to distribution our net sales and operating income are expected to decrease significantly due to the expiration of the solaris agreement 
from october  to september   we distributed solaris product nationwide  pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement 
sales of products purchased from solaris  our largest supplier  accounted for approximately of distribution s net sales and of central s net sales during fiscal and of distribution s net sales and of central s net sales during fiscal in january monsanto sold its solaris lawn and garden business exclusive of its roundup r herbicide products for consumer use to scotts 
beginning october   scotts began to distribute ortho r and roundup r products through a system that involves a combination of distributors  of which we are the largest  as well as through direct sales by scotts to certain major retailers 
in addition  scotts has begun to sell miracle gro directly to certain retailers 
we believe that the business likely to be taken over in this fiscal year ending september  by scotts is estimated to be approximately million in sales 
the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was approximately million 
we expect this loss of gross profit to be partially offset this fiscal year with expense reductions and other business growth 
however  there is no assurance that the business taken over by scotts in the current fiscal year will not be greater than million 
in addition  there can be no assurance  that scotts will continue to do business with us in future years or that we will be successful in our attempts to reduce expenses and generate new business 
the amount and profitability of distribution s business with scotts in fiscal and in future years  if any  may be influenced by numerous factors and is impossible to predict 
accordingly  the actual results of our operations may differ significantly from the foregoing estimates 
the sale of the solaris business by monsanto and the end of the solaris agreement subject our distribution business to significant uncertainties 
these include our new relationship with scotts and the final accounting for all issues between us and monsanto under the solaris agreement  such as the amounts receivable from monsanto for cost reimbursements  payments for cost reductions and payments for services  the amounts payable to monsanto for inventory  and responsibility for obsolete inventory and for non payment by solaris sub agents 
the resolution of these uncertainties may involve litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and or cash flows 
distribution depends on a small number of suppliers for a significant portion of its net sales 
while distribution purchases products from over  different manufacturers and suppliers  it believes that over of its net sales in fiscal were derived from products purchased from its five largest suppliers 
distribution believes that approximately of its net sales during fiscal and of its net sales during fiscal were derived from sales of products purchased from solaris  distribution s largest supplier 
the solaris agreement expired on september  the loss of the exclusive relationship between us and solaris is expected to have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
similarly  the loss of  or a significant adverse change in  the relationship between us and any other key manufacturer or supplier could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
in addition  during the peak selling season  there may be unanticipated shortages of certain high demand products 
although historically distribution has purchased enough inventory of such products or their substitutes to satisfy retailer demand  the unanticipated failure of any manufacturer or supplier to meet distribution s requirements or its inability to obtain substitutes could have a material adverse effect on us 
in most cases distribution operates without written agreements with its suppliers 
accordingly  although distribution believes it has good relationships with its suppliers  there is a risk that one or more of our suppliers may at any time terminate its supply relationship with distribution 
distribution depends on a few customers  including wal mart and home depot  for a significant portion of its net sales 
distribution s largest customer is wal mart  which accounted for approximately of distribution s net sales for fiscal and distribution s second largest customer is home depot  which accounted for approximately and of distribution s net sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  wal mart is having certain products delivered to its internal distribution centers rather than directly to stores 
this will adversely affect our revenue from these products 
if wal mart increases deliveries to its internal distribution centers rather than directly to stores in the future  our revenues could suffer 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  the relationship between distribution and wal mart or home depot could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
the loss of or reduction in orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
our business will suffer if manufacturers and suppliers sell directly to retailers 
manufacturers and suppliers of lawn and garden products have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to retailers  including distribution s major customers 
since the expiration of the solaris agreement  scotts has begun to sell solaris r and miracle gro r products directly to some retailers 
most of distribution s major customers  including its top ten customers  purchase certain products typically high volume items ordered in large quantities directly from manufacturers or suppliers 
distribution believes that most major manufacturers and suppliers that utilize distributors continually evaluate the effectiveness of their distribution programs as well as the performance of individual distributors  and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that major manufacturers and suppliers of the products distributed by distribution will not modify their distribution programs in ways that could adversely affect us 
in addition to direct sales from manufacturers and suppliers to retailers  certain retailers  like wal mart  have  and may intensify their efforts to have  products shipped by distribution to their internal distribution centers rather than directly to stores 
such direct shipments generally yield lower gross margins to distribution than shipments to retailers stores  but distribution believes that its associated operating costs are typically lower with such direct shipments 
if these programs become more common or if other methods of distribution of lawn and garden products become more widely accepted  our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
the majority of our pet supply distribution sales are made to independent pet retailers  whose market share has been eroded by the growth of national specialty pet stores 
historically  a majority of our pet supply distribution sales have been made to independent pet retailers 
in recent years  these independent pet retailers have experienced severe competition from and a loss of market share to national specialty pet retailers  like petsmart and petco  and mass merchants  like wal mart  kmart and target 
in addition  these independent pet retailers are now experiencing competition from internet e retailers 
the future success of our pet supply distribution business will depend on our ability to offer competitive costs and value added services to independent pet dealers and to increase sales to national specialty pet retailers and mass merchants 
if independent pet retailers continue to lose market share to national specialty pet retailers and we are unable to expand our business with these pet retailers  distribution s net sales will decline and our operating income will suffer 
adverse weather during the peak gardening season can hurt distribution s and our net sales 
because demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather  particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season  distribution s revenue and our results of operations could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures  water shortages or floods 
during the last several years  our results of operations were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in some parts of the country 
additionally  distribution s business is highly seasonal  with approximately of its sales in fiscal occurring during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
historically  substantially all of distribution s operating income is generated in this period 
because of intense competition  distribution s product sales generate low margins 
the lawn and garden and pet supply distribution industries in which we operate are characterized by relatively low profit margins 
as a result  distribution s success is highly dependent upon increasing revenues and profits through internal expansion and acquisitions  effective cost and management controls and differentiating its services from those of its competitors 
the wholesale lawn and garden and pet supply distribution businesses are highly competitive  with many companies competing principally on the basis of price and service 
in addition to competition from other distributors  distribution also competes with manufacturers and suppliers  like scotts  that elect to distribute certain of their products directly to retailers  including distribution s major customers  and private label product suppliers 
there can be no assurance that distribution will not encounter increased competition in the future or will not lose business from major manufacturers that elect to sell their products directly to retailers  either of which could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
risks relating to pet products pet products depends on a few customers  including petsmart and petco  for a significant portion of its net sales 
pet products largest customer is petsmart  which accounted for approximately and of pet products net sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
pet products second largest customer is petco  which accounted for approximately and of pet products net sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  the relationship between pet products and petsmart or petco could have a material adverse effect on pet products business and financial results 
the loss of or reduction in orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or pet products inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
an increase in market prices for grains could have a negative impact on our operating income 
pet products financial results depend to a large extent on the cost of raw materials and the ability of pet products to pass along to its customers increases in these costs 
in particular  our kaytee subsidiary is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for commodity grains 
historically  market prices for commodity grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors  including changes in united states government farm support programs  changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons 
in the event of any increases in raw materials costs  pet products would be required to increase sales prices for its products in order to avoid margin deterioration 
there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of pet products ability to implement future price adjustments in the event of increased raw material costs or as to whether any price increases implemented by pet products may affect the volumes of future shipments 
to protect against changes in market prices  we enter into purchase contracts for grains and bird seed to cover approximately one third of the purchase requirements for a selling season 
since we hedge only a portion of our purchase requirements  if market prices for grains increase  our cost of production would increase 
risks relating to central generally our quarterly operating results are susceptible to fluctuations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our net sales and net income on a quarterly basis 
factors that may contribute to this variability include 
the final resolution of payments due between us and monsanto under the solaris agreement  such as the amounts receivable from monsanto for cost reimbursements  payments for cost reductions and payments for services  the amounts payable to monsanto for inventory  and responsibility for obsolete inventory and for non payment by solaris direct sales accounts  
the extent of lost business from the expiration of the solaris agreement and our ability to offset the loss of gross profit under the solaris agreement through expense reductions and other business growth  
weather conditions and seasonality during peak gardening seasons  
shifts in demand for lawn and garden products  
shifts in demand for pet products  
changes in product mix  service levels and pricing by us and our competitors  
the effect of acquisitions  and 
economic stability of retail customers 
in addition  because our distribution business operates on relatively low margins  our operating results in any quarterly period could be affected significantly by slight variations in revenues or operating costs 
for the same reason  our quarterly results also may be vulnerable to problems in areas such as collectibility of accounts receivable  inventory control and competitive price pressures 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to these variations in quarterly operating results and other factors 
our ability to grow will depend upon internal expansion and acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we aggressively pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  adverse short term effects on our operating results  integration of financial reporting systems and the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
since  central has completed over acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we can successfully integrate acquired businesses or that such businesses will enhance our business 
we have also had preliminary acquisition discussions with  or have evaluated the potential acquisition of  numerous other companies over the last several years 
we are unable to predict the likelihood of a material acquisition being completed in the future 
we may seek to finance any such acquisition through additional debt or equity financings  which could result in dilution and additional risk for the holders of our common stock 
we anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  may become available in the near future 
if and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available  we intend to pursue them actively 
no assurance can be given that any acquisition by us will or will not occur  that if an acquisition does occur that it will not materially and adversely affect us or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing our business 
our future results of operations will also depend in part on our ability to successfully expand internally by increasing the number of distribution centers and new product lines  and to manage any future growth 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to open or operate new distribution centers  obtain or integrate additional product lines or manage any future growth successfully 
our success is dependent upon retaining key personnel 
our future performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of william e 
brown  our chairman and chief executive officer  glenn w 
novotny  our president and chief operating officer  and brooks m 
pennington iii  the president of pennington 
the loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect upon us 
in addition  our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we do not adequately address year compliance issues  our business could be disrupted  we could incur unanticipated expenses and we could lose customers 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects associated with the year issue 
the year issue exists because many currently installed computer systems  software products and applications use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems may not be able to recognize or distinguish the year from the inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to incorrectly process critical operational and financial information 
our services rely on a complex communications infrastructure including telecommunications systems that we cannot adequately evaluate for year compliance 
in addition  our services are dependent upon equipment and software provided by third parties that may not be year compliant 
the failure of these systems or of any third party equipment or software to achieve year compliance could result in 
inability to process customer orders or communicate electronically with suppliers and customers  
delay or loss of revenue  
cancellations of contracts by customers  
diversions of our management s attention and development resources  
damage to our reputation  and 
litigation costs 
for more information on our year issues  you should read the discussion in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of year section of this form k 
the holders of our class b stock  through their voting power  can greatly influence control of the company 
as of december   william e 
brown  our chairman and chief executive officer  controls approximately of the voting power of our capital stock and  therefore  can effectively control all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the power to elect all of our directors 
holders of class b stock are entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or of the total votes cast 
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned 
the holders of class b stock have approximately of the combined voting power  subject to the aforementioned voting restrictions 
holders of class b stock are likely to be able to elect all of our directors  control our management and policies and determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders except to the extent that a class vote of the common stock is required by applicable law 
the disproportionate voting rights of the common stock and class b stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be  or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by our common stockholders 
accordingly  such disproportionate voting rights may deprive holders of common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices  since takeover bids frequently involve purchases of stock directly from stockholders at such a premium price 
the products that we manufacture and distribute may subject us to environmental considerations 
many of the products that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
such regulations are often complex and are subject to change 
environmental regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacturing or use of our products or regulating their disposal 
regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations 
although we believe we are and have been in substantial compliance with such regulations and has strict internal guidelines on the handling and disposal of our products  there is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such regulations or incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations 
however  neither the compliance with regulatory requirements nor our environmental procedures can ensure that we will not be subject to claims for personal injury  property damages or governmental enforcement 
product liability insurance 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products 
although we generally seek to insure against such risks  there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us and could prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk central is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
central does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the interest payable on central s bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt had been higher than actual rates  interest expense would have increased by approximately  and  for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
in addition  central has fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments in marketable debt securities  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
except for the interest rate swap agreements discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  central does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
commodity prices 
central is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for grains  bird seed and grass seed 
to mitigate risk associated with increases in market prices and commodity availability  central enters into contracts for grains  bird seed and grass seed purchases 
foreign currency risks 
central has minimal sales outside of the united states and  therefore  has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
purchases made from foreign vendors are primarily made in us dollars and  therefore  the company has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
central does not hedge against foreign currency risks and believes that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
