item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to those discussed in risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this document 
overview since the company s founding in  a primary focus of its operations has been research and development 
achievement of successful research and development and commercialization of products derived from such efforts is subject to high levels of risk and significant resource commitments 
the company has a history of operating losses and expects to incur substantial additional expenses over at least the next few years as it continues to develop its proprietary products  devote significant resources to preclinical studies  clinical trials  and manufacturing and to defend its patents and other proprietary rights 
the company s revenues to date have consisted principally of research and development funding  licensing and signing fees and milestone payments from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under collaborative research and development  humanization  patent licensing and clinical supply agreements 
these revenues may vary considerably from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and revenues in any period may not be predictive of revenues in any subsequent period  and variations may be significant depending on the terms of the particular agreements 
in  the company began receiving royalties from sales of zenapaxr 
royalties on sales of zenapax are payable under exclusive license agreements with hoffmann la roche inc and affiliates roche 
the company has also entered into non exclusive licenses under the company s antibody humanization patents for other humanized antibody products recently approved for marketing 
royalty revenues from third party sales of licensed humanized antibodies are subject to the specific terms of each agreement and  under the company s policy  are recognized by the company during the quarter such royalties are reported to pdl 
this method of revenue recognition may increase fluctuations reported in any particular quarter since the agreements generally provide for royalty reports to the company following completion of each calendar quarter or semi annual period 
further  royalty revenues are unpredictable as they are dependent upon numerous factors including the seasonality of sales of licensed products  the existence of competing products and the marketing efforts of the company s licensees 
in addition  certain licensees have rights to partially offset certain previously paid milestones and third party royalties against royalties payable to the company 
although the company anticipates entering into new collaborations from time to time  the company presently does not anticipate continuing to realize non royalty revenue from its new and proposed collaborations at levels commensurate with the revenue historically recognized under its older collaborations 
moreover  the company anticipates that it will incur significant operating expenses as the company increases its research and development  manufacturing  preclinical  clinical  marketing and administrative and patent activities 
accordingly  in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or patent licensing or humanization agreements  significant royalties on sales of products licensed under the company s intellectual property rights  or other sources  the company expects to incur substantial operating losses in the foreseeable future as certain of its earlier stage potential products move into later stage clinical development  as additional potential products are selected as clinical candidates for further development  as the company invests in additional facilities or manufacturing capacity  as the company defends or prosecutes its patents and patent applications and as the company invests in research or acquires additional technologies  product candidates or businesses 
contract revenues from research and development are recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contracts 
revenues from achievement of milestone events are recognized when the funding party agrees that the scientific or clinical results stipulated in the agreement have been met 
deferred revenue arises principally due to timing of cash payments received under research and development contracts 
results of operations years ended december   and the company s total revenues were million in as compared to million in and million in total research and development revenues represented million  million and million of total revenues in  and  respectively 
interest and other income were million in  million in  and million in the increase in total research and development revenues in from the prior years was primarily attributable to increased licensing and signing fees  milestone payments  royalties and manufacturing services revenues under clinical supply agreements during the period 
the company recognized million in licensing and signing fees  milestone payments  manufacturing services revenues under clinical supply agreements  research and development reimbursement funding and royalties in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
of the amounts expended by the company for research and development  million in  million in and million in represented third party funded research and development activities not including licensing and signing fees  milestone payments and product sales 
interest and other income increased to million in from and million in and  respectively 
this increase in and is primarily attributable to the increased interest earned on the company s investment balances as a result of the company s follow on public offering  which was completed during the first quarter of total costs and expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in in  the company incurred a non cash special charge of million associated with the extension of the term of certain stock options that were granted prior to the special charge is expected to be non recurring and conformed the term of previously granted stock options  which was six years  to those granted since february  ten years 
exercise prices of the stock options were not altered 
without the non cash special charge in  total costs and expenses in increased to million as compared to million  due principally to an increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses in increased to million from million in and million in the increase in costs and expenses as compared to was primarily a result of the addition of staff  increased expenses due to the relocation and expansion of the company s headquarters and research and development facilities in fremont  california  the initiation and continuation of clinical trials  costs of conducting preclinical tests and expansion of pharmaceutical development capabilities including support for both clinical development and manufacturing process development 
general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in and million in these increases were primarily the result of increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support the company s expanding operations 
liquidity and capital resources to date the company has financed its operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities  research and development revenues and interest income on invested capital 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and investments in the aggregate of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  this decrease in cash resources in primarily reflects the company s investment of approximately million in its new fremont  california headquarters and research and development facility for construction of these new facilities and related improvements  including expanded laboratory and development facilities 
in  boehringer mannheim gmbh boehringer mannheim invoked the dispute resolution provisions under its collaborative research agreement with the company to address the reimbursement of up to million for the phase ii study of ostavir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b chb then being conducted by boehringer mannheim as well as certain legal expenses related to boehringer mannheim s participation in the company s public offering in the first quarter of in march  roche acquired boehringer mannheim 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding but in any event has estimated and recorded a liability with respect to this matter 
the collaborative research agreement with boehringer mannheim provides for reimbursement from pdl of costs and expenses of up to million for a phase ii study of ostavir in the event certain conditions are met with respect to that study 
as set forth in the statements of cash flows  net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to the company s increased revenues and lower net loss during the period 
as set forth in the statements of cash flows  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in and provided by investing activities of million in the change in was primarily the result of reinvestment activities associated with the purchases of short and long term investments 
as set forth in the statements of cash flows  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the change in was primarily the result of the completion of a public offering by the company and the exercise of outstanding stock options 
the change in was primarily the result of the completion of a public offering of million shares of the company s common stock in the first quarter of the company s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others  royalties from the marketing and sales efforts of third party licensees under the company s patents  the ability of the company to enter into additional collaborative  patent licensing or humanization arrangements  the progress of the company s product candidates in clinical trials  the ability of the company s collaborative partners to obtain regulatory approval and successfully manufacture and market products  the continued or additional support by collaborative partners or other third parties of research and clinical trials  enhancement of existing and investment in new research and development programs  the time required to gain regulatory approvals  the resources the company devotes to self funded products  manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  the ability of the company to achieve milestones and obtain and retain funding from third parties under collaborative agreements  the development of internal marketing and sales capabilities  the demand for the company s potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by the company  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect the company s proprietary technology 
in order to develop and commercialize its potential products the company may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing may only be available on terms dilutive to existing stockholders 
the company believes that existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs through at least year compliance as is true for most companies  the ability of the company s systems and equipment as well as those of its key suppliers to address the year yk issue presents a potential risk for the company 
if systems software and or equipment containing embedded software or controllers do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the risk for the company exists in two areas systems used by the company to run its business and systems used by the company s suppliers 
the company is currently evaluating its exposure in these two areas 
the company has also reviewed  but views as a much less significant risk  claims related to potential warranty or other claims from its collaborative research customers 
based on a preliminary assessment by an outside consultant retained by the company in early  the company believes that its most important information systems are yk compliant  however  the company is in the process of conducting a comprehensive inventory and evaluation of its systems  equipment and facilities 
in connection with its recent move to a new headquarters and research and development facility in fremont  california  the company has replaced or upgraded many of its systems and equipment that were known or believed to present potential yk problems 
in addition  the company specifically identified and contacted certain key vendors regarding yk compliance of its key information systems and has either received software upgrades or assurances that yk compliant software will be made available in a manner designed for the company to timely address the yk issue with respect to these systems 
the company has retained this consultant to develop and implement a yk program  which retention includes the development of a more extensive inventory and assessment program for the company with respect to yk risks 
the consultant has expertise in assessing other organizations with similar vendors and computer systems 
this program will include a comprehensive review of all major systems and equipment of the company and will also include a contingency plan for any mission critical systems that may be identified as potential yk problems 
the company has established a yk committee with responsibility for coordinating awareness and identifying potential yk risk areas within the company 
as part of its comprehensive review of potentially affected systems  equipment and facilities  the company is also reviewing controllers used to perform key functions in its manufacturing facility in plymouth  minnesota 
at this time  the company has not reviewed all systems and processes for potential yk problems nor has the company identified alternative remediation plans if upgrade or replacement is not feasible 
the company will consider the need for such remediation or replacement plans as it continues to assess the yk risk 
for yk non compliance issues identified to date  the cost of upgrade or remediation has not been and is not expected to be material to the company s operating results 
the company has completed a work and project plan for company awareness and is implementing a detailed assessment and inventory review process corresponding to the five step general accounting office recommended process guidelines 
for yk compliance  the total out of pocket costs expended to date and currently planned budget expenditures are less than  if implementation of replacement systems is delayed  or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  the company s results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company has identified and inquired of most of its critical suppliers and has plans to initiate further inquiries of other suppliers in order to determine whether the operations and the products or services provided by these identified vendors are yk compliant 
where practicable  the company will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of vendors to be yk compliant 
in the event that vendors are not compliant  the company may adjust its purchasing decisions or seek alternative sources of supplies or services 
however  many of the company s vendors have been qualified for regulatory purposes such that qualifying new vendors could involve significant time and resource commitments by the company 
failure of vendors to be yk compliant remains a possibility and could limit the ability of the company to manufacture material for clinical studies or timely conduct regulatory compliance programs that would result in a delay in the initiation or continuation of certain planned clinical studies 
significant delays or expenditures due to vendors failures to become yk compliant could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
with respect to research conducted by the company in support of its collaborative research customers  many of the systems and software used to support such efforts are new 
where appropriate  the company has  as a condition to accepting such systems and software  required that the systems be yk compliant 
item a 
market risk s the following discussion about the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company maintains a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid  debt securities which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in the company s investment portfolio are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale and therefore are subject to interest rate risk 
the company does not currently hedge interest rate exposure 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million
