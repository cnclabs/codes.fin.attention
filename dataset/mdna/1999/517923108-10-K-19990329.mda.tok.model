recent accounting pronouncements comprehensive income the company adopted the sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income on january  sfas no 
establishes standards to measure all changes in equity that result from transactions and other economic events other than transaction with owners 
comprehensive income is the total of net earnings loss and all other non owner changes in equity 
the company does not have any transactions or other economic events that qualify as comprehensive income as defined under sfas no 
as such  net earnings loss approximated comprehensive income for each of the years in the three year period ended december  disclosures about segments of an enterprise in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise 
this statement  which establishes standards for reporting and disclosures of certain information about operating segments in complete sets of financial statements  is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   although earlier adoption is permitted 
reclassifications of financial information for earlier periods presented for comparative purposes is required under sfas no

 earnings per share  is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december  sfas replaces accounting principles board opinion apb no 
and simplifies the computation of earnings per share eps by replacing the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
basic eps is computed by dividing income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution from securities that could share in the earnings of the company  similar to fully diluted eps under apb no 
the statement requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps by entities with complex capital structures 
the company adopted sfas no 
for the financial statements ended december  all years presented have been restated to reflect basic and diluted net income loss per share 
for the years ended december  and  stock options issued under the company s stock option plans and warrants were not included in the computation of diluted eps because to do so would have been antidilutive

year state of readiness the company is aware of what could be a critical problem with older computer systems 
the critical problem refers to computers that designate the year as a two digit number and thus may recognize the year as the year the company has created a task force to ascertain its year compliance 
the task force is lead by the senior vice president of engineering 
the company uses a wide variety of microprocessor based equipment  which runs software on numerous computer platforms 
the company is in the process of determining the potential impact of the century date change by conducting an inventory of computerized equipment and testing all of the company s systems for compliance 
the company is also contacting third party vendors regarding their year compliance 
testing of internal systems is complete on approximately of both information technology systems and non information technology systems 
no significant year issues have been revealed 
the company anticipates that the remaining systems testing will be completed in cost to address the company s year issues 
when systems are identified that are not compliant the company contracts with vendors to obtain updates  which will ensure compliance  and in a limited number of instances the systems are replaced 
some older equipment will need to be reset after january  but should function properly thereafter 
the cost to remedy year compliance to date has not been material and is being funded out of operating cash flow 
the company estimates that any future remedial costs will not be material and should not exceed  the company s risk the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption or failure of certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
to date  the only conditions that the company has determined that may result in the company s inability to provide services to our clients  and consequently  a loss of revenue  would be a loss of service to the company by regulated public utility companies 
the company cannot assess the likelihood of this occurrence 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company believes its continuing actions will significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and in particular about year compliance 
the company believes that the completion of year testing will reduce the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations 
contingency plans the company will test new products for year compliance 
to the extent the company has not been able to determine third party vendor compliance  plans for alternative backup suppliers are being established and the company plans to acquire an additional supply of critical parts to reduce the chance of a loss of services 
the first week of january is traditionally a period of very low demand for the company s services 
the company plans to have appropriate technical staff monitor operations on and after january and take necessary action to provide services to our customers 
the company will continue to refine its contingency plans throughout the remainder of forward looking statements and comments in this k are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements relating to  among other things  the prospect for the company to continue to achieve growth in sales  the ability to reduce overhead and the ability to achieve positive operating results and successfully resolve year issues are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which are significant in scope and nature  including risks related to competition  availability of capital and continuation of sales levels 
these risks and uncertainties are significant in scope and nature  including risks related to competition  continuation of sales levels and the risks related to the cost and availability of capital
