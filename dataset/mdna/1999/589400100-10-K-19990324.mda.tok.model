item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  including the effect of natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
the company operates primarily in the state of california  which was the only state it produced business in prior to the company expanded its operations into georgia and illinois in with the acquisition of american fidelity insurance group afi in december  now american mercury insurance group ami  the company expanded into the states of oklahoma and texas 
the company further expanded its operations into the state of florida during during  approximately of the company s direct premiums written  including ami  were derived from california 
in california  as in various other states  all property and casualty rates must be approved by the insurance commissioner before they can be used 
in february  the california insurance commissioner approved new rates which were designed to improve the company s competitive position for new insureds 
these rate changes  which became effective on may   provided for decreases in premium rates for new insureds 
further rate modifications were approved and made effective on october   april   october   april  and november  the rate change made april  reduced rates by approximately and was primarily made to improve mercury s competitive position in the marketplace 
except for the april  rate change  the rate changes made over the last several years have been substantially revenue neutral overall  with physical damage rates being increased and bodily injury liability rates decreased 
the rate change made effective may  resulted in a substantial increase in new business being submitted to the company 
the subsequent rate modifications have allowed the company to maintain ongoing growth in policy count 
since march   private passenger automobile ppa policies in force in california have increased from approximately  to  at december   an annual rate of increase of over 
in september  the california insurance commissioner issued new permanent rating factor regulations designed to implement the requirements that automobile insurance rates be determined by driving safety record  years of driving experience  miles driven per year and whatever optional factors are determined by the insurance commissioner to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the law further requires that each of the four factors be applied in decreasing order of importance 
the company submitted a proposed rating plan in response to these regulations in march the company s plan was approved by the california doi and became effective october  although the rate changes produced some minor dislocations  implementation of the new plan did not have a material effect on the company s overall competitive position or its profitability 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million increased  reflecting unit growth which was somewhat offset by reduced average premiums per policy 
the reduction in average premium per policy was primarily the result of the rate decrease taken for california business in april in addition  a large portion of the new california business written during  which grew at a rate of due to a new law requiring proof of insurance to register a car  qualified for a discount on renewal in consequently  the average premium per policy declined in as compared to net premiums written in of  million increased over a year earlier  continuing a growth trend which began in the second quarter of the company increased its marketing efforts in april  launching a fully integrated radio and billboard advertising program 
although the campaign has not met expectations  the company believes continuing the advertising program is necessary in the current competitive climate 
the california automobile insurance marketplace remains intensely competitive 
most of the major direct writers  who represent the company s chief competition  have instituted one or more rate reductions over the last twenty four months and many have significantly increased their marketing efforts 
the loss ratio in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was  compared with in the favorable loss experience is largely related to the effectiveness of proposition  an initiative made effective january  which prohibits recovery of non economic pain and suffering losses by uninsured motorists or drunk drivers injured in automobile accidents 
the rate reduction beginning on april  negatively affected the company s loss ratio during a large portion of the full impact of the rate reduction on the company s loss ratio will be felt in and succeeding periods 
the expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was in and in the increase in the expense ratio was largely attributable to increased base commissions and profit related bonuses to agents  expenses associated with the advertising program implemented in april  and start up costs from the company s entry into the florida market 
total losses and expenses in  excluding interest expense of million  were million  resulting in an underwriting gain for the period of million  compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in was million  compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of  million fixed maturities at cost  equities at market was  compared with on average investments of  million in the effective tax rate on investment income was in  compared to in the lower tax rate in reflects the benefits derived from replacing taxable issues held in the ami investment portfolio  when purchased in december  to non taxable issues throughout the and fiscal years 
the redemption of bonds acquired during higher interest periods has been a negative influence on realized yields in each of the last several years and is expected to continue in bonds matured and called in totaled million  compared with million in approximately million of bonds are expected to mature or be called in average yields being obtained during the first quarter of on new investments are to basis points lower than the average yield realized during realized investment losses in were million  compared with realized gains of million in the gains and losses in both years were principally incurred to enhance investment income on both fixed maturities and equity securities  including perpetual preferred stocks 
the losses realized in were designed to utilize expiring capital gains tax benefits 
realized gain from sale of subsidiaries of million was derived from the sale for cash of cimmaron insurance company  an inactive company acquired in the american mercury insurance group purchase made in december the income tax provision of million in represented an effective tax rate of  compared with an effective rate of in the rate is higher primarily because the company had a large non tax deductible charge for esop compensation expense in that did not occur in esop compensation expense is calculated based on the current market value for the company s stock multiplied by shares allocated to employees  however  only the company s cost basis is deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the company s share price on the shares allocated in  which had been purchased in  caused the large non deductible charge that resulted in increasing the company s effective tax rate in this situation did not occur in as the shares allocated to employees during had a similar cost and market value 
net income in was million or per share  basic  compared with million  or per share  basic  in basic per share results are based on million average shares in and million average shares in diluted per share results were in and in year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million including million contributed by ami increased  primarily reflecting unit growth and the fact that results only include one month of premiums from ami 
without the impact of the ami results  premiums earned increased 
average premium per policy for the year declined slightly 
net premiums written in of  million including million contributed by ami increased over a year earlier excluding the impact of ami results  continuing a growth trend which began in the second quarter of growth in written premiums in california of for all of was aided by a new california law that became effective january  which requires proof of insurance for the registration new or renewal of a motor vehicle 
the greater part of the new business generated by the new law occurred in the first half of  and provided for only the minimum liability coverage required by law 
the average premium on this business was substantially less than that produced by full coverage policies  which constitute a majority of the company s total premium volume 
the loss ratio in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was  compared with in the improvement in loss experience in is in large part related to the loss cost savings from the enactment of california proposition that became effective january  the loss ratio reflects deficiencies from unfavorable development on allocated loss adjustment expenses from prior periods 
the initial estimates were based principally on the company s actual experience and did not fully reflect the increases in the legal expenses of defending the company s insureds arising from the company s policy of aggressively defending  including litigating  exaggerated bodily injury claims arising from minimal impact automobile accidents 
the expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was in and in the increase in the expense ratio in reflects increased provisions for profit related bonuses to both agents and employees and the inclusion of the operating results of ami for a full year 
total losses and expenses in  excluding interest expense of million  were million  resulting in an underwriting gain for the period of million  compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in  including a contribution from ami of million  was million  compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of  million  including ami  fixed maturities at cost  equities at market was  compared with on average investments of million in the effective tax rate on investment income was in  compared with in the effective tax rate was increased  and the effective after tax yield was reduced slightly  by the inclusion of ami for the full year the slightly higher tax rate on investment income in reflects an increase in the proportion of investment income derived from taxable bonds held by ami and dividends on equities  principally perpetual preferred stocks 
the redemption of bonds acquired during higher interest periods has been a negative influence on realized yields in each of the last several years and will continue in bonds matured and called in totaled million  compared with million in realized investment gains in were million  compared with realized losses of million in the gains and losses in both years reflect principally income enhancing swaps of both fixed maturities and equity securities  including perpetual preferred stocks 
the losses realized in were designed to utilize expiring capital gains tax benefits 
the income tax provision of million in represented an effective tax rate of  compared with an effective rate of in the increase in the rate is largely attributable to the increased proportion of realized gains and the increase in underwriting gains  both of which are taxed at the full corporate rate of  in contrast to investment income which consists primarily of tax exempt interest and tax sheltered dividend income 
net income in was million  or per share  basic  compared with million  or per share  basic  in basic share results are based on million average shares in and million average shares in  adjusted for a two for one stock split effective september  diluted per share results  calculated in accordance with new accounting standards  were in and in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided from operating activities in  was million  while funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of investments was million  of which approximately was represented by the sale of equity securities 
the amortized cost of fixed maturity investments increased by million during the year 
equity investments  including perpetual preferred stocks  increased by million at cost  while short term cash investments decreased by million 
the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale that were sold  called or matured during the year was million 
the market value of all investments held at market as available for sale exceeded the amortized cost of  million at december  by million 
that unrealized gain  reflected in shareholders equity  as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable tax effects  was million at december  compared with an unrealized gain of million at december  the increase in market values since december  reflects principally the substantial decline in intermediate and long term interest rates during the company s cash and short term investments totaled million at december  together with funds generated internally  such liquid assets are more than adequate to pay claims without the sale of long term investments 
traditionally  it has been the company s policy not to invest in high yield or junk bonds 
in  the company adopted a policy to place a small proportion of its investments in the taxable sector in bonds rated lower than investment grade  but not lower than ba by moody s or bb by standard poor s 
at december  bond holdings rated below investment grade totaled million at market cost million  or of total investments 
the average rating of the  million bond portfolio at amortized cost was aa  while the average effective maturity  giving effect to anticipated early call  approximates years 
the modified duration of the bond portfolio at year end was years  reflecting the heavy weighting of high coupon issues  including housing issues subject to sinking funds  and other issues which are pre refunded or are expected to be called prior to their maturity 
duration measures the length of time it takes to receive all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a much better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically  and  within the tax exempt sector  consist largely of high coupon revenue issues  many of which have been pre refunded and escrowed with us treasuries 
general obligation bonds of the large eastern cities have generally been avoided 
holdings in the taxable sector consist largely of senior public utility issues 
fixed maturity investments of  million amortized cost  include million amortized cost of sinking fund preferreds  principally utility issues 
the market value of all fixed maturities exceeded cost by million at december  the only securities held which may be considered derivatives are a small amount of adjustable rate preferred stocks 
except for company occupied buildings  the company has no direct investments in real estate and no holdings of mortgages secured by commercial real estate 
equity holdings of million at market cost million  including perpetual preferred issues  are largely confined to the public utility and banking sectors and represent about of total shareholders equity 
the company had outstanding debt at december  of million 
of this amount  million has been borrowed under a three year revolving credit bank loan 
the loan agreement requires the company to meet numerous affirmative and negative covenants 
the proceeds of the loan were used to repay a prior loan and to acquire ami  with the balance contributed to the company s new insurance subsidiaries 
the loan agreement may be extended annually for additional periods of one year each to maintain the three year maturity date 
the interest rate is variable and is optionally related to the federal funds rate  bank of new york rate prime rate or the eurodollar london interbank rate libor 
based on the rates effective through february   libor plus  the net interest cost on the loan approximates 
the company also maintains a million line of credit  of which million was drawn on at december  and is due october  the line of credit may be used to fund the company s stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in august as well as for general corporate purposes 
the interest rate and loan covenants are the same as the company s million loan discussed above 
the company plans to extend the maturity date of this loan during under the stock repurchase program  the company may purchase over a one year period up to million of mercury general s common stock 
the purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at the discretion of management 
the program will be funded by the sale of lower yielding tax exempt bonds  the proceeds of the million credit facility and internal cash generation 
during  the company purchased  shares of the common stock in the open market at an average price of 
the shares purchased were retired 
in march  the company s employee stock ownership plan the plan purchased  shares of mercury general s common stock in the open market at a price of per share  adjusted for the two for one stock split effective september  the purchases were funded by a five year term bank loan of million to the plan which is guaranteed by the company 
the shares have been allocated to employees over the amortization period of the loan  with the initial allocation made in december the remaining balance of the loan of million was retired in march with the proceeds of contributions to the plan by the company for the year  and the remaining unallocated shares were credited to employees esop balances at december  in august  the plan purchased  shares of mercury general s common stock in the open market at a price of per share 
the purchases were funded by a five year term bank loan of million to the plan which is guaranteed by the company 
the shares are being allocated to the employees over a five year period  with the initial allocation made in december since dividends on unallocated shares held by the plan are tax deductible if they are used for debt service  as are company contributions to the plan  the net  after tax interest cost to the company for the borrowed funds used for the plan stock purchase is less than the effective rate of interest on the loan  which  in was 
in december  the naic adopted a risk based capital formula for casualty insurance companies which establishes recommended minimum capital requirements for casualty companies 
the formula has been designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors 
the company has estimated the risk based capital requirements of each of its insurance subsidiaries as of december  each of the companies policyholders surplus exceeded the highest level of minimum required capital 
as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the california earthquake authority cea is a quasi governmental organization that was established in to provide a market for earthquake coverage to california homeowners 
during the second quarter of  the company began placing all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowners policy through the california earthquake authority 
the company receives a small fee for placing business with the cea 
upon the occurrence of a major seismic event  the cea has the ability to assess participating companies for losses 
these assessments are made after cea capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment 
based upon mercury casualty company s participation percentage  and recently published statistical information from the cea  the company  at december   estimates its assessment exposure to a northridge type earthquake to be approximately million and its maximum total exposure to cea assessments to be approximately million 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all of the licensed insurance subsidiaries of million at december   and net written premiums for the twelve months ended on that date of  million  the ratio of writings to surplus was approximately to year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  or as no date 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business operations 
in march of  the company completed the modifications necessary to its computer programs and systems for all of its critical systems for business written in california  georgia  illinois and florida 
modifications were made to both hardware and software 
the company considers policy issuance  premium billing and collections and its claims systems as its critical systems 
the modifications completed on the above critical systems represent approximately of the company s total premiums written 
the american mercury group  acquired by the company in december and which represents approximately of the company s total premiums written  is in the process of completing the modifications necessary  including the conversion to new critical systems  to become year compliant 
the company expects to have their critical systems to be year compliant by the second quarter of other non critical systems are already year compliant or are in the process of being modified or converted to become year compliant 
the company expects to have its non critical systems to be year compliant by the second quarter of the company expensed approximately  in and  in  primarily for internal labor costs  related to year modifications 
the company expects to incur an amount less than what has previously been expensed for it is not possible to quantify the aggregate cost to the company with respect to the year problems  although the company does not anticipate it will have a material adverse impact on its business 
while the year considerations are not expected to materially impact the company s internal operations  they may have a material effect on some of the company s agents  suppliers and financial institutions with whom the company conducts business  and thus indirectly affect the company 
the company has commenced a program to ascertain the compliance status of those companies with whom the company conducts material business 
this program includes sending out questionnaires to our major business partners regarding their year readiness 
based on the responses received to date  the company does not anticipate any material impact on its operations or financial condition 
mercury general is developing business resumption contingency plans specific to the year business resumption contingency plans address the actions that would be taken if critical business functions cannot be carried out in the normal manner upon entering the next century due to system or supplier failure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity investments  which at december  comprised of total investments at market value 
tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments with the remaining amount consisting of sinking fund preferred stocks and taxable bonds 
equity securities  consisting primarily of preferred stocks  account for of total investments at market 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments which are primarily us treasury backed overnight repurchase agreements and short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that takes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company has historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s investment philosophy has resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
this has exposed the portfolio to interest rate risk  which  in periods of falling interest rates  as was generally experienced over the last decade  resulted in substantial realized and unrealized gains on the portfolio holdings 
during  lower market interest rates reduced the duration of the company s fixed income portfolio 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which reduce the duration of the asset as rates decline 
consequently  the average modified duration of the portfolio decreased from years at december  to years at december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
the value of the equity investments consists of million in common stocks and million in non sinking fund preferred stocks 
the common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the non sinking fund preferred stocks are typically valued using credit spreads to u 
s 
treasury benchmarks 
this causes them to be comparable to fixed income securities in terms of interest rate risk 
the company s primary strategy for equity investments is to maximize current income by accelerating the number of dividends collected on the overall funds employed 
the company times the purchase and sale of equity investments to coincide with quarterly dividend payment dates and minimum holding periods as required by the internal revenue service 
this timing strategy results in very short asset holding periods  often less than three months 
the company believes that this strategy coupled with the defensive nature of the assets involved reduces the risk  over time  of significant portfolio valuation fluctuations due to changes in market interest rates 
in general  credit spreads have widened in the non sinking fund sector since the credit crisis of this past summer 
the company s non sinking fund preferred stock assets were negatively affected by this market change 
the duration of the company s non sinking fund preferred stocks is years 
this implies that an upward parallel shift in the yield curve by basis points would reduce the asset value by approximately million  everything else remaining the same 
the remainder of the equity portfolio  representing of total investments at market value  consists primarily of public utility common stocks 
these assets are defensive in nature and therefore have low volatility to changes in market price as measured by their beta 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was 
based on a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
forward looking statements the foregoing discussion contains forward looking statements regarding the company  its business  prospects and results of operations that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties posed by factors and events that could cause the company s actual business  prospects and results of operations to differ materially from the historical information contained herein and from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  among others  the intense competition currently existing in the california automobile insurance markets  the success of the company in integrating and profitably operating the business of ami  and in expanding generally in florida and other states outside of california  the impact of the year  the impact of the permanent rating factor regulations adopted by the california insurance commissioner for private passenger automobile policies issued in california and the level of investment yields obtainable in the company s investment portfolio in comparison to recent yields  as well as the cyclical and general competitive nature of the property and casualty insurance industry and general uncertainties regarding loss reserve estimates and legislative and regulatory changes  particularly in california
