net income for the year ended april   was  or per common share 
this represents an increase of in net income and earnings per common share 
overview the company is a specialized consumer finance company engaged in the purchase and retention of receivables originated by franchised automobile dealers from the sale of new and late model used vehicles to consumers with substandard credit profiles 
at april   the company had a network of  franchised dealers in states from which it purchases the receivables at the time of origination 
while the company intends to continue to geographically diversify its receivables portfolio  approximately of receivables held for investment by principal balance at april  represent receivables acquired from dealers located in texas 
from its inception in through october  the business strategy of the company was to purchase  pool and sell receivables to third party investors and to recognize gains associated with those sales on a current basis 
in november  the company decided that it could achieve a more stable and predictable income stream through acquiring and retaining receivables for net interest income recognized over the life of the receivables 
the primary element in this strategy is access to institutional financing in sufficient magnitudes and at rates enabling the company to purchase significant volumes of receivables and retain them at a funding cost allowing an adequate net interest margin between portfolio yield and cost of funds 
through the utilization of flexible secured credit facilities and comprehensive credit insurance  the company has been able to access financing on terms permitting it to implement this strategy and to pursue it successfully through the present time 
management believes that continued pursuit of this strategy will enable the company to sustain its growth and maintain a stable earnings stream on a relatively conservative basis 
therefore  since november  the primary source of the company s revenues has been interest income from receivables retained as investments  while its primary cost has been interest expense arising from the financing of the company s investment in such receivables 
the profitability of the company during this period has been determined by the growth of the receivables portfolio and effective management of net interest income and fixed operating expenses 
in addition  on october   the company completed the acquisition of auto lenders acceptance corporation alac from fortis  inc headquartered in atlanta  georgia  alac was engaged in essentially the same business as the company and additionally performs servicing and collection activities on a portfolio of receivables acquired for investment as well as on a portfolio of receivables acquired and sold pursuant to two asset securitizations 
as as result of the acquisition  the company increased the total dollar value on its balance sheet of receivables  acquired an interest in certain trust certificates and interest strips related to the asset securitizations and acquired certain servicing rights along with furniture  fixtures  equipment and technology to perform the servicing and collection functions for the portfolio of receivables under management 
alac performs servicing and collection functions on a million portfolio of loans  including loans serviced for others  originated in states

the company intends to increase its acquisition of receivables by expanding its dealer base in existing states served  by expanding its dealer base into new states  and by generating additional loan volume through alliances with major banks 
to the extent that the company s receivables acquisitions exceed the extinguishment of receivables through principal payments  payoffs or defaults  its receivables portfolio and interest income will continue to increase

analysis of net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned from the receivables portfolio and interest expense incurred on the credit facilities used to acquire the receivables 
net interest income increased to million in  an increase of and when compared to amounts reported in and the increase resulted primarily from the growth of the receivables held for investment and contributions to interest income from the receivables acquired for investment and trust certificates 
the amount of net interest income is the result of the relationship between the average principal amount of receivables held and average rate earned thereon and the average principal amount of debt incurred to finance such receivables and the average rates paid thereon 
changes in the principal amount and rate components associated with the receivables and debt can be segregated to analyze the periodic changes in net interest income 
the following table analyzes the changes attributable to the principal amount and rate components of net interest income dollars in thousands years ended april  to to increase increase decrease decrease due to change in due to change in average average principal average total net principal average total net amount rate increase amount rate increase receivables held for investment interest income      interest expense     net interest income     results of operations fiscal year ended april   compared to fiscal year ended april  dollars in thousands interest income

in addition  the interest income was positively influenced for the year ended april   by a 
increase in effective yield 
management attributes the increase in yield to increases in the interest rates charged on its financing programs in the fourth quarter and to a decrease in the percentage of receivables held for investment on which rate participation is paid to dealers as incentive to utilize the company s financing programs 
interest expense 
interest expense for increased by  or  over an increase in the weighted average borrowings outstanding under secured credit facilities of resulted in  of this difference 
interest expense associated with the million acquisition facility also contributed to the increase 
weighted average cost of debt for secured credit facilities remained flat

provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses for increased by  or  over  as a result of an increase in net charge offs from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the increase in charge offs is attributable to the growth in the receivables held for investment  an increase in the number of loans that are seasoned nine to months  which is generally where the highest percentage of repossessions occur and lower recovery amounts on the sale of the vehicle collateral 
servicing income 
represents servicing income received on loan receivables previously sold by alac in connection with two asset securitization transactions 
under these transactions  alac  as servicer  is entitled to receive a fee of on the outstanding balance of the principal balance of securitized receivables plus reimbursement for certain costs and expenses incurred as a result of its collection activities 
under the terms of the securitizations  the servicer may be removed upon breach of its obligations under the servicing agreements  the deterioration of the underlying receivables portfolios in violation of certain performance triggers or the deteriorating financial condition of the servicer 
servicing income was  for the year late fees and other income 
late fees and other income increased to  in from in which primarily represents late fees collected from customers on past due accounts  collections on certain alac assets which had previously been charged off by the company and interest income earned on short term marketable securities and money market instruments 
servicing fee expenses 
servicing fee expenses increased  or  from to servicing fees consist primarily of fees paid by the company to general electric credit corporation with which the company has a servicing relationship on its receivables held for investment

salaries and benefits increased from  in to  in  an increase of  or 
the increase is a result of expansion of the company s operation as a result of an increase in its receivables portfolio  expansion of its geographic territory and an increase in staffing levels as a result of the acquisition of alac 
as of april   the company had employees as compared to as of april  other expenses 
other expenses for increased from the increase is a result of an expansion of the company s asset base and an increase in the volume of applications for credit processed by the company in the period versus the comparable period and operating costs associated with the acquired company which were not applicable to the prior year period

the weighted average cost of debt remained flat and positively impacted interest expense by net interest income 
net interest income increased to  in  an increase of over the increase resulted primarily from the growth of the receivables portfolio which offset a decline in the net interest spread 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses for increased by  or  over  as a result of an increase in net charge offs from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the increase in charge offs is attributable to the growth in the portfolio  an increase in the number of loans that are seasoned nine to months  which is generally where the highest percentage of repossessions occur and lower recovery amounts on the sale of the vehicle collateral 
at april   the company increased its estimate of losses associated with certain assets held for sale to adjust for lower than expected realized amounts of those assets 
accordingly  an additional  incremental charge was taken in the fourth quarter to adjust the carrying value of the repossessed inventory to better reflect the impact of lower used car prices during the period 
this resulted in a corresponding increase in net charge offs and provision for the period 
other income 
for  other income  which consists primarily of late fees and interest income from short term investments  decreased by  or  over primarily as a result of a decline in interest earning investments 
servicing fee expenses 
servicing fee expenses increased  or  from to since these costs vary with the volume of receivables serviced  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of receivables serviced  which increased by  or  from to salaries and benefit expenses 
salaries and benefits increased from  in to  in  an increase of or

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash flows 
the company s business requires significant cash flow to support its operating activities 
the principal cash requirements include i amounts necessary to acquire receivables from dealers and fund required reserve accounts  ii amounts necessary to fund premiums for credit enhancement insurance or other credit enhancement required by the company s financing programs  and iii amounts necessary to fund costs to retain receivables  primarily interest expense and servicing fees 
the company also requires a significant amount of cash flow for working capital to fund fixed operating expenses  primarily salaries and benefits 
the company s most significant cash flow requirement is the acquisition of receivables from dealers 
the company paid million for receivables acquired to be held for investment for compared to million in the company funds the purchase price of receivables through a combination of two warehouse facilities 
the firc credit facility generally permits the company to borrow up to the outstanding principal balance of qualified receivables  but not to exceed million 
the fiacc commercial paper facility generally allows the company to borrow up to of the outstanding principal balance of the receivables  but not to exceed million 
receivables that have accumulated in the firc credit facility may be transferred to the fiarc commercial paper facility at the option of the company 
the fiarc commercial paper facility provides an additional financing source up to million 
substantially all of the company s receivables are pledged to collateralize these credit facilities 
the company s most significant source of cash flow is the principal and interest payments received from the receivables portfolios 
the company received such payments in the amount of million in and million in such cash flow funds repayment of amounts borrowed under the firc credit and commercial paper facilities and other holding costs  primarily interest expense and servicing and custodial fees 
during fiscal years and  the company required net cash flow  respectively  of million and million cash required to acquire receivables held for investment net of principal payments on receivables to fund the growth of its receivables portfolio 
the company has relied on borrowed funds to provide the source of cash flow to fund such growth 
capitalization 
since the change in business strategy to retaining receivables in november  the company has financed its acquisition of such receivables primarily through two related credit facilities 
the company s equity was not a significant factor in its capitalization until the completion of the company s initial public offering of common stock in october  resulting in net proceeds of million 
however  the company expects to continue to rely primarily on its credit facilities to acquire and retain receivables 
the company believes its existing credit facilities have adequate capacity to fund the increase of the receivables portfolio expected in the foreseeable future 
while the company has no reason to believe that these facilities will not continue to be available  their termination could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations if substitute financing on comparable terms was not obtained 
firc credit facility 
the primary source of acquisition financing for receivables held for investment has been through a syndicated warehouse credit facility agented by bank of america 
the firc credit facility currently provides for maximum borrowings  subject to certain adjustments  up to the outstanding principal balance of qualified receivables  but not to exceed the current facility limit of million 
borrowings under the firc credit facility bear interest pursuant to certain indexed variable rate options at the election of the company or any other short term fixed interest rate agreed upon by the company and the lenders 
the company bases its selection of the interest rate option primarily on its expectations of market interest rate fluctuations  the timing and the amount of the required funding and the period of time it anticipates requiring the funding prior to transfer to the fiarc commercial paper facility 
the firc credit facility provides for a term of one year  matures october   at which time the outstanding principal balance will be payable in full  although there are provisions allowing the company a period of six months to refinance the facility in the event that it is not renewed

based on month end balances 
fiarc commercial paper facility 
the company has indirect access to the commercial paper market through a million commercial paper conduit facility with enterprise funding corporation enterprise  a commercial paper conduit managed by bank of america 
receivables that have accumulated in the firc credit facility may be transferred to the fiarc commercial paper facility by transferring a specific group of receivables to a discrete special purpose financing subsidiary and pledging those receivables as collateral 
receivables are generally transferred from the firc credit facility to the fiarc commercial paper facility to refinance them on a longer term basis at interest rates based on commercial paper rates and to provide additional borrowing capacity under the firc credit facility 
borrowings under this commercial paper facility bear interest at the commercial paper rate plus 
the current term of the fiarc commercial paper facility expires on march  if the fiarc commercial paper facility were terminated  no new receivables could be transferred from the firc credit facility to enterprise  however  the then outstanding receivables would continue to be financed until fully amortized

based on month end balances 
fiacc commercial paper facility 
on january   fiacc entered into a million commercial paper conduit facility with vfcc  a commercial paper conduit administered by first union national bank  to fund the acquisition of additional receivables generated under certain of the company s financing programs 
fiacc acquires receivables from the company and may borrow up to of the face amount of receivables  which are pledged as collateral for the commercial paper borrowings 
vfcc funds the advance to fiacc through the issuance of commercial paper indirectly secured by the receivables to institutional or public investors 
the company is not a guarantor of  or otherwise a party to  such commercial paper 
the maximum borrowings available under the facility are million 
the company s interest cost is based on vfcc s commercial paper rates for specific maturities plus 
in addition  the company is required to pay periodic facility fees of on the unused portion of this facility 
as collections are received on the transferred receivables  they are remitted to a collection account maintained by the collateral agent for the fiacc commercial paper facility 
from that account  a portion of the collected funds are distributed to vfcc in an amount equal to the principal reduction required to maintain the advance rate and to pay carrying costs and related expenses  with the balance released to the company 
in addition to the advance rate  fiacc must maintain a cash reserve as additional credit support for the facility 
the current term of the fiacc commercial paper facility expires on december  if the facility was terminated  no new receivables could be transferred to fiacc and the receivables pledged as collateral would be allowed to amortize

based on month end balances 
acquisition facility 
on october   the company  through its indirect  wholly owned subsidiary  fifs acquisition funding company llc fifs acquisition  entered into a million non recourse bridge financing facility with vfcc  an affiliate of first union national bank  to finance the company s acquisition of alac 
contemporaneously with the company s purchase of alac  alac transferred certain assets to fifs acquisition  consisting primarily of i all receivables owned by alac as of the acquisition date  ii alac s ownership interest in certain trust certificates and subordinated spread or cash reserve accounts related to two asset securitizations previously conducted by alac  and iii certain other financial assets  including charged off accounts owned by alac as of the acquisition date 
these assets  along with a million cash reserve account funded at closing serve as the collateral for the bridge facility 
the facility bears interest at vfcc s commercial paper rate plus 
under the terms of the facility  all cash collections from the receivables or cash distributions to the certificate holder under the securitizations are first applied to pay alac a servicing fee in the amount of on the outstanding balance of all owned or managed receivables and then to pay interest on the facility 
excess cash flow available after servicing fees and interest payments are utilized to reduce the outstanding principal balance on the indebtedness 
in addition  one third of the servicing fee paid to alac is also utilized to reduce principal outstanding on the indebtedness 
the bridge facility expires on october  the company is currently negotiating with first union to refinance the acquisition facility over an extended term sufficient to amortize the outstanding balance of the indebtedness through collections of the underlying receivables and trust certificates 
it is anticipated that the permanent financing will consist of issuing various tranches of notes  to be held by vfcc  or certificates to be held by the company and first union  which will contain distinct principal amortization requirements and interest rates 
the company anticipates no material change in the weighted average interest rate under the permanent financing 
it is anticipated  however  that in conjunction with vfcc providing the permanent financing  vfcc will obtain a beneficial interest in certain portion of the excess cash flow generated by the remaining assets 
the amount of excess cash to be received by first union will vary depending upon the timing and amount of such cash flows 
to the extent that the facility is not finalized prior to the expiration date  the company intends to seek a short term extension to allow for the completion of the term financing 
the company has no reason to believe that an agreement with vfcc will not grant such an extension or that an agreement to refinance the bridge loan will not be reached prior to the then final maturity of the bridge facility 
if the facility were not extended  the remaining outstanding principal balance would be due at maturity 
working capital facility 
the company also maintains a million working capital line of credit with bank of america and first union national bank that is utilized for working capital and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at the company s option of i bank of america s prime lending rate  or ii a rate equal to above the libor rate for the applicable interest period 
in addition  the company is also required to pay period facility fees  as well as an annual agency fee 
the expiration of the facility is october  if the lender elected not to renew  any outstanding borrowings would be amortized over a one year period 
the company presently intends to seek an extension of this arrangement prior to its expiration 
at april   there was million outstanding under this facility 
interest rate management 
the company s operating revenues are derived almost entirely from the collection of interest on the receivables that it retains and its primary expense is the interest that it pays on borrowings incurred to purchase and retain such receivables 
the company s capacity to generate earnings is therefore largely a function of its ability to maintain a sufficient net interest margin 
accordingly  significant increases in the interest rates at which the company borrows funds could promptly reduce the net interest margin between portfolio yield and cost of funds and thereby adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company endeavors to offset rate fluctuation risk by using interest rate management products that convert all or a substantial portion of its floating rate exposure to fixed rates 
the company seeks to minimize its exposure to adverse interest rate movements by entering into interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts which approximate the balance of its debt outstanding under its warehouse and commercial paper credit facilities 
however  the company will be exposed to limited rate fluctuation risk to the extent it cannot perfectly match the timing of net advances from its credit facilities and acquisitions of additional interest rate swaps 
the company s credit facilities bear interest at floating interest rates which are reset on a short term basis whereas its receivables bear interest at fixed rates which do not generally vary with changes in interest rates 
to manage the risk of fluctuation in the interest rate environment  the company enters into interest rate swaps and caps to lock in what management believes to be an acceptable net interest spread 
during the years ended april   and amounts paid pursuant to the company s interest rate management products were not material in relation to interest expense in the aggregate nor did they have a material impact on the company s weighted average costs of funds during such periods 
the company is currently a party to a swap agreement with bank of america pursuant to which the company s interest rate exposure is fixed  through january  at a rate of on a notional amount of million as further described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
this agreement may be extended to january  at the sole discretion of the counter party 
as a result  at april   the company had converted a total of million in floating rate debt to a fixed rate and had outstanding floating rate debt of secured credit facilities of  the company is currently evaluating additional interest rate management products with a view to fixing or limiting its interest rate exposure with respect to amounts that are substantially equivalent to its aggregate outstanding borrowings under the firc credit facility and the commercial paper facilities 
on october   in connection with the million acquisition facility  the company  through fifs acquisition  entered into a series of hedging instruments with first union national bank designed to hedge floating rate borrowings under the acquisition facility against changes in market rates 
accordingly  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements  the first in the initial notional amount of million swap a pursuant to which the company s interest rate is fixed at  and  the second in the initial notional amount of million swap b pursuant to which the company s interest rate is fixed at 
the notional amount outstanding under each swap agreement amortizes based on an implied amortization of the hedged indebtedness 
swap a has a final maturity of december  while swap b has a final maturity of february  the company also purchased two interest rate caps which protect the company and the lender against any material increases in interest rates which may adversely affect any outstanding indebtedness which is not fully covered by the aggregate notional amount outstanding under the swaps 
the first cap agreement enables the company to receive payments from the counterparty in the event that the one month commercial paper rate exceeds on a notional amount that increases initially and then amortizes based on the expected difference between the outstanding notional amount under swap a and the underlying indebtedness 
the interest rate cap expires december  and the cost of the cap is amortized in interest expense for the period 
the second cap agreement enables the company to receive payments from the counterparty in the event that the one month commercial paper rate exceeds on a notional amount that increases initially and then amortizes based on the expected difference between the outstanding notional amount under swap b and the underlying indebtedness 
the interest rate cap expires february  and the cost of the cap is imbedded in the fixed rate applicable to swap b 
delinquency and credit loss experience the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by nonperforming receivables 
the company seeks to manage its risk of credit loss through i prudent credit evaluations  ii risk management activities  iii effective collection procedures  and iv by maximizing recoveries on defaulted loans 
the company is not exposed to credit losses on its entire receivables held for investment portfolio due to prior business strategies that included third party insurers and a dealer recourse program 
an allowance for credit losses of  as a percentage of the exposed core receivables of  is 
with respect to receivables acquired for investment  the company has established a nonaccretable loss reserve to cover expected losses over the remaining life of the receivables 
as of april   the nonaccretable loss reserve as a percentage of receivables acquired for investment was 
the nonaccretable portion represents  at acquisition  the excess of the loan s scheduled contractual principal and contractual interest payments over its expected cash flows 
the company considers a loan to be delinquent when the borrower fails to make a scheduled payment of principal and interest 
accrual of interest is suspended when the payment from the borrower is over days past due 
generally  repossession procedures are initiated to days after the payment default 
under its financing programs  the company retains the credit risk associated with the receivables acquired 
historically  the company has purchased credit enhancement insurance from third party insurers which covers the risk of loss upon default and certain other risks 
until march  such insurance absorbed substantially all credit losses 
in april  the company established a captive insurance subsidiary to reinsure certain risks under the credit enhancement insurance coverage for all receivables acquired in march and thereafter 
in addition  receivables financed under the fiarc and fiacc commercial paper facilities do not carry default insurance 
provisions for credit losses of  and  have been recorded for the years ended april  and  respectively for losses on receivables which are either uninsured or which are reinsured by the company s captive insurance subsidiary 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of losses for receivables that may become uncollectable 
in making this estimate  management analyzes portfolio characteristics in the light of its underwriting criteria  delinquency and repossession statistics  historical loss experience  and size  quality and concentration of the receivables  as well as external factors such as future economic outlooks 
the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates and qualitative evaluations and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  are reported in earnings in the period they become known 
the following table summarizes the status and collection experience of all receivables acquired by the company dollars in thousands as of or for the years ended april  number number of loans amount of loans amount receivables held for investment delinquent amount outstanding days   days days or more  total delinquencies   total delinquencies as a percentage of outstanding receivables net charge offs as a percentage of average receivables outstanding during the period amounts of delinquent receivables outstanding and total delinquencies as a percentage of outstanding receivables are based on gross receivables balances  which include principal outstanding plus unearned interest income 
does not give effect to reimbursements under the company s credit enhancement insurance policies with respect to charged off receivables 
the company recognized no charge offs prior to march since all credit losses were reimbursed under such policies 
subsequent to that time the primary coverage has been reinsured by an affiliate of the company under arrangements whereby the company bears the entire risk of credit losses  and charge offs have accordingly been recognized 
the total number of delinquent accounts days or more as a percentage of the number of outstanding receivables for the company s portfolio of receivables acquired for investment and receivables managed was as of april market risk the market risk discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially due to changes in the company s product and debt mix  developments in the financial markets  and further utilization by the company of risk mitigating strategies such as hedging 
the company s operating revenues are derived almost entirely from the collection of interest on the receivables it retains and its primary expense is the interest that it pays on borrowings incurred to purchase and retain such receivables 
the company s credit facilities bear interest at floating rates which are reset on a short term basis  whereas its receivables bear interest at fixed rates which do not generally vary with changes in interest rates 
the company is therefore exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates on its credit facilities 
the company believes that it takes the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate increases on the company s financial position and operating performance 
the company relies almost exclusively on revolving credit facilities to fund its origination of receivables 
currently all of the company s credit facilities bear interest at floating rates tied to either a commercial paper index or libor 
the company manages this risk by converting a portion of its floating rate debt to a fixed rate utilizing interest rate swaps which effectively hedge the floating rate debt against an increase in market interest rates 
as of april   the company had million of floating rate secured debt outstanding which was not hedged by interest rate swaps 
for every increase in interest rates eg commercial paper rates  annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately  assuming the company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt and assuming an immediate increase in rates 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs and microprocessors using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year the year issue 
such programs or microprocessors may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in the company s activities and operations 
if the company  or third parties with which it has a significant relationship or upon which is relies for certain data utilized in its business the counterparties  fail to make necessary modifications  conversions and contingency plans on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the company believes its internal systems are compliant with the year issue  the potential effects of the year issue cannot be quantified at this time because the company cannot accurately estimate the magnitude  duration  or nature of problems that noncompliance by the counterparties will have on its operations 
although the risk is not presently quantifiable  the following disclosure is intended to summarize the company s actions to minimize the risk from the year issue 
programs that will operate in the year unaffected by the change in year from to are referred to herein as year compliant 
state of readiness 
the company relies almost exclusively on third party application software in its operations 
all software applications are designed to run on client server systems 
the company employees three major software applications in its business i a loan origination system which is utilized in the receipt  approval and funding of receivables  ii a loan servicing and collection system which is used by the company s personnel to track and service all active customer accounts as well as repossession and disposition activities  and iii accounting systems which process all general ledger and financial reporting activities 
each of the vendors that supply these software applications has certified to the company that their respective applications are year compliant 
in addition  the company has developed internal testing procedures on each process and presently intends to conduct these tests prior to august  to confirm the vendors certification as to compliance 
the company has also requested confirmation from all other counterparties  which an internal review indicated may be exposed to year issues 
as of june   the only material counterparties which had not confirmed year compliance were national banks  upon which the company relies for cash management  lockbox and certain custodial services relating to its credit facilities  and the credit reporting agencies upon which the company relies in obtaining credit histories on the loan applications it reviews for approval 
all counterparties have assured the company that they expect to be year compliant prior to december  costs 
since the company does not rely on internally developed applications  it does not currently anticipate that compliance efforts to solve the year issue will require additional expenditures in any material amount 
to the extent that software upgrades must be purchased in order to insure compliance  the cost of such software will be expensed 
risks 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is a compliance failure by a counterparty upon which the company relies 
such a failure would likely have an effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the magnitude of that effect however  cannot be quantified at this time because of variables such as the type and importance of the third party  the possible effect on the company s operations and the company s ability to respond 
thus  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect on the company if such third parties do not remediate their systems in a timely manner 
in addition  it is possible that the company would experience a failure of a non mission critical system for a period of time  which could result in a minor disruption in some internal operations 
contingency plans 
contingency planning is an integral part of the company s year readiness project
