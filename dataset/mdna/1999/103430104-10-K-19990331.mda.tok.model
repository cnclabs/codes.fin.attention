in conjunction with our ipo  we contributed approximately million to boykin hotel properties  lp  an ohio limited partnership the partnership  in exchange for an approximate equity interest as the sole general partner of the partnership and we loaned million to the partnership in exchange for an intercompany convertible note 
the partnership then acquired nine hotel properties the initial hotels and another eight hotel properties in using remaining proceeds from the ipo and borrowings under our credit facility 
we do all of our business through the partnership 
on february   we completed a follow on public equity offering and issued an additional million common shares 
the net proceeds of approximately million were contributed to the partnership  increasing our ownership percentage therein to 
the proceeds were used by the partnership to pay down existing indebtedness under the credit facility  purchase limited partnership units from two unaffiliated limited partners  fund the acquisitions of two hotels purchased in march and for general corporate purposes 
on may  we completed our merger with red lion inns limited partnership  in which we acquired red lion inns operating lp olp which owns a portfolio of ten doubletree licensed hotels 
in the transaction  we issued million common shares and paid approximately million in cash to the red lion limited partners and general partner 
the total consideration value  including assumed liabilities of approximately million and common shares issued valued at million  was million 
the issuance of our common shares in the merger had the impact of increasing our ownership percentage in the partnership to 
at the end of  we owned hotels containing a total of  guest rooms located in different states 
our principal source of revenue is lease payments from lessees pursuant to percentage lease agreements 
percentage lease revenue is based upon the room  food and beverage and other revenues of our hotels 
the lessees ability to make payments to us pursuant to the percentage leases is dependent primarily upon the operations of the hotels 
results of operations the following discusses our actual results of operations for compared to and compared to the short period from november through december  it also discusses our pro forma results of operations and that of bmc for the years ended december  and the pro forma information is presented as if the following items had been consummated as of january  our sale of million common shares in february  our issuance of million common shares in may related to the red lion merger  our acquisitions in and  and our repurchase of  common shares in the pro forma results of operations exclude the results of the daytona beach radisson resort and the doubletree kansas city  as these hotels were closed for renovations during portions of the year 
because the rent we collect from bmc constitutes a significant portion of our lease revenues  we believe that a discussion of the historical and pro forma operations of bmc is also important to understand our business 
the pro forma information of bmc is presented as if our acquisitions of hotels leased by bmc and westboy were consummated as of january  the pro forma information excludes the results of the daytona beach radisson resort  as this hotel was closed during most of for renovation

million in the loss in was partially the result of the application of the percentage lease rent terms during an interim period as opposed to a full calendar year 
the terms of each lease allow for annualizing the rent payable to compensate for the effects of seasonality when base rents may be required during periods of lower occupancy which would otherwise be offset during peak seasons 
historically  the fourth quarter has been a period of lower occupancy for the initial hotels on a combined basis in comparison to the other three quarters of the year

million in liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders  is our share of the partnership s cash flow from the percentage leases 
the lessees obligations under the percentage leases are unsecured and the lessees ability to make rent payments to the partnership under the percentage leases  are dependent on the lessees ability to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the hotels 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  million of restricted cash for the payment of capital expenditures  real estate tax and insurance and we had outstanding borrowings totaling million and million against our credit facility and term note payable  respectively 
in february  the borrowings under our credit facility increased to million to fund capital expenditures for significant renovations at four doubletree hotels 
we have a million credit facility available  as limited under terms of the credit agreement  to fund acquisitions of additional hotels  renovations and capital expenditures  and for our working capital needs 
for information relating to the terms of our credit facility and our million term note payable  please see notes and  respectively  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of boykin lodging company included in this form k 
we may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate  and be subject to such other terms as the board of directors considers prudent 
in november  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to million in securities over two years 
securities issued under this registration statement may be preferred shares  depository shares  common shares or any combination thereof  and may be issued at different times  depending on market conditions 
warrants to purchase these securities may also be issued 
the terms of issuance of any securities covered by this registration statement would be determined at the time of their offering 
the million common shares sold in the february  offering were sold under this registration statement 
on february   we formed a joint venture with aew partners iii  lp aew  an investment partnership managed by aew capital management  lp  a boston based real estate investment firm that manages a portfolio of approximately billion 
aew will provide million of equity capital for the joint venture  and we will provide approximately million and serve as the operating partner of the joint venture 
we plan to use the joint venture to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in the lodging industry 
combined with debt financing  the initial capital commitments would allow the joint venture to complete approximately million of acquisitions over a month period 
the joint venture agreement also contains provisions for aew and boykin to double their respective capital commitments under certain circumstances  which could result in total acquisitions by the joint venture of approximately million 
in addition  as part of the transaction  we will receive incentive returns based on the performance of acquired assets as well as other compensation as a result of the joint venture s activities 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations and our credit facility will enable us to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next year 
our percentage lease revenues and cash flow are dependent in large part upon the hotel revenues recognized by our lessees 
there can be no assurance that those revenues will meet expected levels 
the availability of borrowings under the credit facility is restrained by borrowing base and loan to value limits  as well as other financial performance covenants contained in the agreement 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available in anticipated amounts from the credit facility 
additionally  no assurance can be given that we will make distributions in the future at the current rate  or at all 
inflation our revenues are from percentage leases  which can change based on changes in the revenues of our hotels 
therefore  we rely entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessees ability to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and our lessees  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessees ability to raise rates to keep pace with inflation 
our general and administrative costs as well as real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance and ground rent are subject to inflation 
year compliance many computer systems were originally designed to recognize calendar years by the last two digits in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates 
as a result computerized systems  which include information and non information technology systems  and applications used by us  are being reviewed  evaluated and modified or replaced  if necessary  to ensure all such financial  information and operational systems are year compliant 
state of readiness we are addressing the year compliance issue by focusing on our corporate facility  which includes all of our administrative  non hotel operating functions  and on our hotel properties 
corporate facility for our corporate facility  we are in the phase of assessing our hardware components and critical corporate business applications  all of which are expected to be modified or upgraded  as necessary  to ensure year compliance by the end of the second quarter of hotel properties we are communicating with our lessees and other vendors with whom we do significant business to determine their readiness of year compliance 
for all of our hotels  we have gained an understanding of the process which our lessees have undertaken to address the risk assessment  validation  remediation and contingency plans related to year compliance 
these processes have included the following completion of an inventory and assessment of all computerized systems  applications and hardware by internal personnel  prioritization of items representing critical business applications  and estimation of remediation costs 
most of our lessees are using internal personnel  who are determining the level of resources needed  necessary modifications or upgrades  remediation and contingency plans to become year compliant 
our lessees have informed us that they have dedicated the tools and resources to address all year issues in an effort to be year compliant during the third quarter of there can be no assurance that the efforts related to the hotel properties will be sufficient to make these properties computerized systems and applications year compliant in a timely manner or that the allocated resources will be sufficient 
a failure to become year compliant could affect the integrity of the hotel property guest check in  billing and accounting functions 
certain physical hotel property machinery and equipment could also fail resulting in safety risks and customer dissatisfaction 
we cannot predict at this time the most reasonably likely worst case scenario relating to year issues 
year project costs we estimate that total unexpended costs for the year compliance review  evaluation  assessment and remediation efforts for the corporate facility and the hotels should not exceed 
million  although there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed this amount 
during  we spent approximately million related to computerized systems and equipment which are year compliant 
it should be noted that the vast majority of our costs to remediate this issue are capital in nature and would therefore not affect our funds from operations 
contingency plan we are in the process of developing our contingency plan for the corporate facility and hotel properties to provide for the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios regarding year compliance 
this contingency plan is expected to be completed in the third quarter of seasonality our hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
twenty six of our hotels maintain higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
the five hotels located in florida experience their highest occupancy in the first quarter 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under the percentage leases 
we anticipate that our cash flow from the percentage leases will be sufficient to enable us to continue to make quarterly distributions at the current rate for the next twelve months 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter because of temporary or seasonal fluctuations in percentage lease revenue  we expect to utilize cash on hand or borrowings to make those distributions 
no assurance can be given that we will make distributions in the future at the current rate  or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in we entered into a million term note payable which bears interest at a fixed rate of for ten years  and a new fixed rate to be determined thereafter 
the term note requires interest only payments for the first two years  with principal repayments commencing in the third loan year based on a year amortization schedule 
the term note expires in june assuming a increase in interest rates as of december   the fair market value of the term note payable would be approximately million 
in  we also entered into a new unsecured credit facility with a group of banks  which enables us to borrow up to million  subject to borrowing base and loan to value limitations  at a rate of interest that fluctuates at libor plus to 
due to changes in the us and global economy  interest rates fluctuate regularly which creates risk that these rates may increase in the future  which would adversely impact our interest expense and cash flows 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of fair values of financial instruments and the terms of the unsecured credit facility and the term note payable
