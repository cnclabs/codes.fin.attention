item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general profitability in the chicken industry can be materially affected by the commodity prices of chicken  chicken parts and feed ingredients 
those commodity prices are determined largely by supply and demand 
as a result  the chicken industry as a whole has been characterized by cyclical earnings 
these cyclical fluctuations in earnings of individual chicken companies can be mitigated somewhat by business strategy  product mix  sales and marketing plans  and operating efficiencies 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  we have concentrated on the production and marketing of prepared food products 
prepared food products generally have higher profit margins than our other products 
also  the production and sale in the us of prepared food products reduces the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability 
feed ingredient purchases are the single largest component of our cost of goods sold  representing approximately of our cost of goods sold in the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
as further processing is performed  feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product s total production costs  thereby reducing their impact on our profitability

gross profit 
gross profit was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or over the same period last year 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increased gross profit resulted primarily from lower feed ingredient costs per pound and higher production volumes 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  commodity chicken margins have been under pressure due  in part  to increased levels of chicken production in the us and mexico 
to the extent that these trends continue  subsequent period s gross margins could be negatively affected to the extent not offset by other factors such as those discussed under general above

liquidity and capital resources the company maintains million in revolving credit facilities and million in secured term borrowing facilities 
the credit facilities provide for interest at rates ranging from libor plus one and three eighths percent to libor plus one and three quarters percent and are secured by inventory and fixed assets or are unsecured 
as of november   million was available under the revolving credit facilities and million was available under the term borrowing facilities 
on june   the camp county industrial development corporation issued million of variable rate environmental facilities revenue bonds supported by letters of credit obtained by the company 
we may draw from these proceeds over the construction period for our new sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at a poultry by products plant to be built in camp county  texas 
the company is not required to borrow the full amount of the proceeds from the bonds 
all amounts borrowed from these funds will be due in any amounts we do not borrow by june will not be available to us 
the amounts we do borrow will be reflected as debt when we receive them from the camp county industrial development corporation 
it is expected that the reflection of the bonds as debt on our books will occur before june the interest rates on amounts borrowed will closely follow the tax exempt commercial paper rates 
on june  the company entered into an asset sale agreement to sell up to million of accounts receivable 
under this agreement  we sell  on a revolving basis  certain of our trade receivables to a special purpose corporation  wholly owned by the company  which in turn may sell a percentage ownership interest to third parties 
as of october   no sold trade receivables were outstanding and the entire facility was available for sales of qualifying receivables 
at october   the company s working capital increased to million and our current ratio was to compared with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september  strong profits were primarily responsible for the increases in working capital 
trade accounts and other receivables were million at october   compared to million at september  the increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of prepared food products  which normally have longer credit terms than fresh chicken sales 
inventories were million at october   compared to million at september  the million  or  increase in inventories between september  and october  was due primarily to the continuing shift in the sales mix toward prepared foods  which requires a higher level of inventory relative to sales as well as increased production levels in both the us and mexico 
accounts payable were million at october   compared to million at september  the increase in accounts payable between september  and october  was due primarily to higher levels of purchases needed to support the increased production levels in both us and mexico 
capital expenditures of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively  were primarily incurred to acquire and expand certain facilities  improve efficiencies  reduce costs and for the routine replacement of equipment 
we have budgeted an aggregate of approximately million for capital expenditures in each of fiscal years  and  primarily to increase capacity through either building or acquiring new facilities  to improve efficiencies and for the routine replacement of equipment 
however  actual levels of capital expenditures in any fiscal year may be greater or less than those budgeted 
we expect to finance such expenditures with available operating cash flows and long term financing 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was due primarily to increased inventory levels offset by increases in payables and accrued expenses 
the significant increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal  when compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased net income  a reduction of inventory levels and a substantially smaller increase in accounts receivable for fiscal  when compared to fiscal cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the cash provided by used in financing activities primarily reflects the net proceeds payments from notes payable and long term financing and debt retirements 
market risk sensitive instruments and positions the risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of feed ingredients  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
feed ingredients 
the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal 
as a result  the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
as market conditions dictate  the company from time to time will lock in future feed ingredient prices using various hedging techniques  including forward purchase agreements with suppliers and futures contracts 
the company does not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leverage derivatives 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the weighted average cost of the company s primary feed ingredients as of october  based on projected feed consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to cost of sales of approximately million in fiscal after considering the effect of forward purchase commitments and future contracts outstanding as of october  as of october   the company had hedged none of its fiscal feed requirements but had entered into forward purchase contracts for of its fiscal feed ingredient requirements 
foreign currency 
the company s earnings are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the mexican peso net monetary position of its mexico subsidiaries 
the company primarily manages this exposure by attempting to minimize its mexican peso net monetary position  but has also from time to time considered executing hedges to help minimize this exposure 
however  such instruments have historically not been economically feasible 
the company is also exposed to the effect of potential exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that amounts are repatriated from mexico to the united states 
however  the company currently anticipates that the cash flows of its mexico subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested in its mexico operations 
in addition  the mexican peso exchange rate can directly and indirectly impact the company s results of operations and financial position in several manners  including potential economic recession in mexico resulting from a devalued peso 
the impact on the company s financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso cannot be reasonably estimated 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses  representing the change in the us dollar value of the net monetary assets of the company s mexico subsidiaries  were a gain of million in fiscal and a loss of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
on november   the mexican peso closed at to us dollar  a decrease from at october  no assurance can be given as to the future movements in the peso that could affect future earnings of the company 
interest rates 
the company s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its variable rate debt instruments 
the company has variable rate debt instruments representing approximately of its long term debt at october  if interest rates average basis points more in fiscal than they did during fiscal  the company s interest expense would be increased by  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s variable rate long term debt at october  market risk for fixed rate long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis points decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million  using discounted cash flow analysis 
new accounting pronouncements accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is required to be adopted by the company in fiscal years beginning after october  sfas permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance 
sfas will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas  however  it is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company began assessment of its future business system requirements in as a part of the company s review  it determined that it would be required to modify or replace portions of its software and hardware so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
to date  the company has tested the identified systems and updated those systems in the us  including the software and hardware components deemed necessary to ensure the uninterrupted fulfillment of the company s core business processes as they relate to the timely  accurate and quality production and delivery of our products to our customers  the processing of accounting information  and the associated processing and reporting of information as required by our business partners  banks and government agencies 
the company has updated its core systems in mexico 
the company presently believes that with these modifications and replacements  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the company has reviewed year disclosures of the packaged software applications it uses to ensure year readiness 
the suppliers of these software products have provided approaches for the company to ensure compliance of core software  either through program options  upgrades or new products 
these solutions have been implemented and are operational 
the company regularly upgrades and replaces hardware platforms such as database and application servers as well as its telephone systems 
the company currently believes that all of its servers are year ready and of our core personal computers are year compliant 
there are core telephone switching systems  all of which the company believes are year ready 
the embedded technology in the production environment  such as programmable logic controllers  computer controlled valves and other equipment  has been inventoried and all issues identified have been resolved 
based on current evidence  the company believes there will be no significant exposure with regard to its production equipment 
systems assessments and minor system modifications were completed using existing internal resources and  as a result  incremental costs were minimal 
system replacement  consisting primarily of capital projects  were initiated for other business purposes while at the same time achieving year compliance 
system replacement projects were completed primarily using external resources 
the total cost of the year project is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
additionally  the company has initiated communications will all of its significant suppliers and certain large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
to date the significant suppliers  such as fuel  electrical  water  rail  grain and container  have responded favorably 
other key vendor and customer assessments are complete with favorable responses 
the company believes it has no significant exposure from the remaining vendors or customers that have not responded 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other parties upon which the company relies will be converted on a timely basis 
the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by the failure of its systems and applications or those operated by others to properly operate or manage dates beyond the company has instituted a two fold approach to contingency planning  technical and business continuity 
the technical contingency planning took place in conjunction with the implementation of the company s new information systems in the us  and will continue through the end of picking up the non core hardware and support technology in both the us and mexico 
business contingency planning is currently underway and the company will establish contingency plans  if needed  based on supplier evaluation and assessment of risk 
the company believes that its initiatives and its existing business recovery plans are adequate to reasonably address likely year issues  if unforeseen circumstances arise  the company will attempt to develop contingency plans for these situations 
impact of inflation due to moderate inflation in the us and the company s rapid inventory turnover rate  the results of operations have not been significantly affected by inflation during the past three year period
