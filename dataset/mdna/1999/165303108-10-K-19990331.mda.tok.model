general expenditures are for building improvements  computer software and hardware 
financing for the construction program is expected to be provided from short term borrowing and cash from operations 
the construction program is subject to continuous review and modification 
actual construction expenditures may vary from the above estimates due to a number of factors including acquisition opportunities  changing economic conditions  customer growth in existing areas  regulation and new growth opportunities 
chesapeake has budgeted million for environmental related expenditures during and expects to incur additional expenditures in future years  a portion of which may need to be financed through external sources see note l to the consolidated financial statements

results of operations net income for was million as compared to million for and million for the decrease in net income is primarily related to warmer temperatures in the company s northern service territory  partially offset by a one time reduction in pension costs of million resulting from chesapeake s restructuring of the company s retirement benefits plans 
temperatures in  based upon heating degree days  were warmer than normal  warmer than and warmer than temperatures in were approximately warmer than those experienced in normal weather conditions are calculated from the most recent ten years of temperature data measured in heating degree days 
the warmer weather resulted in a reduction in volumes sold by both the natural gas distribution and propane segments 
the lower volumes contributed to the reduction in earnings before interest and taxes ebit for both segments as shown in the table below 
earnings before interest and taxes in thousands increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease ebit by business segment natural gas distribution      natural gas transmission      propane distribution and marketing     advanced information services     other total ebit      natural gas distribution the  reduction in ebit from to was primarily the result of a reduction in gross margin  as indicated in the following table 
exclusive of the expense reductions related to the restructuring of the company s retirement benefits plans  the decrease in ebit of million or was attributable to warmer than normal weather conditions 
the reduction in gross margin of  from the prior year is primarily due to the negative impact of warmer temperatures on volumes sold  partially offset by customer growth during the year 
after taking into account customer growth of for residential and commercial customers in the northern service territory  overall volumes declined by for these customer classifications 
under normal temperatures and customer usage  the customer growth is estimated to generate an additional margin of  annually within this segment 
also contributing to the decline in margin is an reduction in volumes sold and transported to industrial customers in the florida service territory 
although operating expenses remained relatively unchanged  specific expense categories such as marketing  building rent  legal costs and depreciation and amortization increased 
these were offset by decreases in pension expense  administrative fees associated with the pension plan  compensation and outside services 
the reduction in ebit of million from to is primarily related to a decline in total gross margin  as indicated in the following table  coupled with an overall increase in expenses 
the reduction in gross margin is primarily the result of a decline in volumes sold to residential and commercial customers and a decrease in volumes sold and transported to industrial customers in chesapeake s florida service territory 
the reduction in volumes sold to residential and commercial customers was directly related to warmer temperatures  primarily during the first quarter of operating expenses increased  due to increases in compensation  regulatory commission expenses  and costs related to data processing and billable service revenue 
in addition  there was a greater level of maintenance to the gas pipeline system and increased depreciation and amortization due to additional plant being placed in service 
natural gas distribution gross margin summary in thousands increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease revenues gas sold       gas transported     gas marketed      other total revenues       cost of sales gas sold       gas marketed      total cost of sales       gross margin gas sold     gas transported     gas marketed other total gross margin     transportation service does not have an associated cost of sales 
natural gas transmission the earnings before interest and taxes of the company s natural gas transmission segment increased  from to this was the result of an increase in gross margin of  offset by an  increase in operating expenses

gross margin increased under a full year of open access pipeline operations  as well as the full year s effect of both a rate increase and the implementation of new services which were both effective in operating expenses were higher due to increases in regulatory commission expenses  legal fees  pipeline system maintenance and depreciation 
these costs were offset by declines in pension costs  compensation and administrative fees associated with the pension plan 
the transmission segment s ebit increased million from to the rise in ebit was partially attributable to a rate increase and an increase in firm services implemented in  as well as an overall reduction in expenses 
also contributing to the increase in ebit were additional revenues generated by the increase in transportation services that were effective with the implementation of open access 
operating expenses decreased by  or  primarily due to reduced compensation  relocation costs  property insurance and pipeline system maintenance 
these reductions were offset by higher depreciation expenses generated by capital additions during the year 
propane distribution and marketing in may  the company acquired xeron  inc  a wholesale marketer of propane  expanding chesapeake s propane operations see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the ebit contribution of the propane distribution and marketing segment declined by  from to due to a decrease in gross margin which was partially offset by a decline in operating expenses 
exclusive of the expense reduction related to the restructuring of the company s retirement benefits plans  ebit decreased  or 
the propane distribution operation was negatively affected by the warmer temperatures realized in  resulting in a decline in sales volumes of  after taking into account a increase in customer growth 
somewhat offsetting this volume related decline in margin was an increase of in the margin earned per gallon delivered as compared to the prior year 
in addition  the lack of volatility in the wholesale propane market resulted in a reduction to propane marketing margins due to fewer gallons being marketed 
wholesale marketing is a high volume  low margin business 
during  marketing revenues declined by million or while margins declined by  or 
operating expenses declined primarily due to compensation linked to xeron s earnings  pension expense and administrative fees associated with the pension plan 
the company estimates that the warm temperatures experienced in reduced ebit by million when compared to normal temperatures 
in addition  margins during were lower than historical norms  further reducing ebit by approximately million 
the reduction in ebit of million from to was primarily due to a reduction in gross margin earned by the distribution operation  partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses 
distribution margins decreased due to a reduction in sales volumes coupled with a lower margin per gallon sold 
the decline in sales volumes is directly related to the warmer temperatures which averaged warmer than those experienced in furthermore  during the first quarter of  temperatures were warmer than normal 
the marketing operation contributed an additional  to ebit due to a reduction in compensation expense 
advanced information services the results of the advanced information services segment consisted primarily of those of united systems  inc usi 
exclusive of the expense reductions related to the restructuring of the company s retirement benefits plans  ebit contributed by usi increased or  from to due to increased opportunities in areas such as website development  training and consulting  gross margin increased  or million from to although the ebit contribution of this segment remained virtually unchanged from to  usi s gross margin increased by  or 
operating expenses increased due to the opening of a new office in detroit  michigan and the expansion of staff training and marketing efforts to position usi to be able to provide new services and for future growth of current services 
since the rise in operating costs offset most of the growth in gross margin  ebit remained constant 
income taxes operating income taxes decreased  in due to the reduction in ebit 
income taxes also decreased in due to the reduction in ebit 
this was partially offset by a one time expense to establish the deferred income tax liability in connection with the acquisition of tri county 
the financial statements do not include any income tax expense for the acquisition due to its subchapter s status during that year 
other non operating income was   and  for the years  and  respectively

the year chesapeake is dependent upon a variety of information systems to operate efficiently and effectively 
in order to address the impact of the year year or yk on its information systems  chesapeake is in the process of evaluating and remediating any deficiencies 
the company s evaluation of its readiness and the potential impact of the year on its systems have been separated into five components primary internal applications  embedded systems  vendors suppliers  end user computing systems and customers 
chesapeake s primary internal applications include company maintained software systems for its financial information  natural gas customer information and billing  and propane customer information  billing and delivery 
the company completed testing of these three applications in and deems them year ready 
embedded systems include the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system for the natural gas transmission segment  telecommunications  metering and other facilities related systems 
chesapeake has currently identified vendors that support the company s embedded systems 
chesapeake expects to finalize the review for additional vendors and or embedded systems by the end of the first quarter of the company has prioritized these vendors into three potential impact classifications high impact vendors  supporting items such as the scada system  medium impact vendors  supporting systems such as telecommunications  and low impact vendors  supporting items such as copiers and postage meters 
the company has been testing these systems and has contacted all of the vendors currently identified  with responding 
of the vendors contacted  a total of vendors four high impact  six medium impact and ten low impact vendors indicated they were yk ready 
the company has been either working with vendors to reach a state of readiness with the applicable systems or has changed to vendors or systems that are yk ready 
the scada system  the most critical embedded system  is scheduled to be yk ready during the second quarter of chesapeake will continue to follow up with vendors that are not yk ready and will consider alternate providers as necessary to the extent available 
chesapeake has identified vendors suppliers that supply the company with products and services that impact various elements of the company s business 
the company has classified these vendors into three impact classifications high impact vendors such as suppliers of natural gas or propane  medium impact vendors such as regional communication vendors  and low impact vendors 
the company has requested a yk status statement from each of these vendors 
the company has received responses  which indicated that nine medium impact and low impact vendors were yk ready 
the company will continue to follow up with vendors that are not yk ready and will consider alternate providers as necessary to the extent available 
end user computing systems are upgraded periodically through the company s ongoing replacement program 
almost all of the company s personal computers are currently year ready 
additional personal computers will be replaced during the first quarter of chesapeake s local area network is year ready as is all pc based and network based software 
customers  primarily industrial interruptible natural gas customers  must ensure that their plant controls are year ready for their alternative fuel 
the company has identified interruptible customers and will contact each of them by the end of the first quarter of the company will take into account the results of the survey in developing the natural gas contingency plan 
the company believes the most significant potential risks with respect to its internal operations  those over which it has direct control  are its ability to use electronic devices to control and operate its natural gas delivery systems  maintain continuous operation of its computer systems  render timely bills to its customers  and enforce tariffs and contracts applicable to interruptible customers 
the company relies on the producers of natural gas and suppliers of interstate transportation capacity to deliver natural gas to the company s natural gas delivery systems 
the company is also dependent on propane producers  suppliers and railroad facilities to receive propane supply 
chesapeake is also dependent on various suppliers of communication services 
should any of these critical vendors fail  the impact of any such failure could become a significant challenge to the company s ability to meet the demands of its customers  to operate its delivery systems and to communicate with its customers 
it could also have a material adverse financial impact  including but not limited to  lost sales revenues  increased operating costs and claims from customers related to business interruptions 
the company s year evaluation process is addressing each of these risks and the required remediation 
the company is developing its contingency plan for the year  which will address various alternatives and will include assessing a variety of scenarios that could emerge and require the company to react 
chesapeake expects to have its contingency plan finalized by the end of the second quarter of the contingency plan will continue to be modified as warranted by changing events 
the costs incurred as of december  in addressing year issues have been immaterial 
the company has estimated costs of  to replace and or remediate specific embedded systems 
however  until the company has completed further analysis of the impact of the year issue on its embedded systems  vendors suppliers  end user computing systems  customers and contingency planning  it is unable to estimate any additional costs it may incur as a result of its efforts 
presently  no year impacted internal applications or embedded systems have been identified that cannot be upgraded or modified within acceptable time frames 
the target date for completion of all year related activities remains at mid competition historically  the company s natural gas operations have successfully competed with other forms of energy such as electricity  oil and propane 
the principal considerations have been price  and to a lesser extent  accessibility 
as a result of eastern shore s recent conversion to open access  the company expects to be subject to competitive pressures from other sellers of natural gas 
with open access transportation services available on eastern shore s system  third party suppliers will compete with chesapeake to sell gas to the local distribution companies and the end users on eastern shore s system 
eastern shore has shifted from providing sales service to providing transportation and contract storage services 
the company s natural gas distribution operation located in maryland began to offer transportation services to certain industrial customers during during  the distribution operation located in delaware also began offering transportation services 
the company expects to expand the availability of transportation services to additional customers in the future 
the florida distribution operation has been open to certain industrial customers since the company established a natural gas brokering and supply operation in florida to compete for these customers 
both the propane and advanced information services businesses face significant competition from a number of larger competitors with substantially greater resources available to them than those of the company 
in addition  in the advanced information services business  changes are occurring rapidly which could adversely affect the markets for the company s services 
inflation inflation affects the cost of labor and other goods and services required for operation  maintenance and capital improvements 
while the impact of inflation has lessened in recent years  natural gas prices are subject to rapid fluctuations 
these fluctuations are passed on to customers through the gas cost recovery mechanism in the company s tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on its capital investments and returns  the company seeks rate relief from regulatory commissions for regulated operations while monitoring the returns of its unregulated business operations
