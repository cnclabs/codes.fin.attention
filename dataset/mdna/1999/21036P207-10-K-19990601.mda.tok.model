year issue for purposes of the following year discussion  the information presented includes the effect of the black velvet acquisition 
the company has in place detailed programs to address year readiness in its internal systems and with its key customers and suppliers 
the year issue is the result of computer logic that was written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer logic that processes date sensitive information may recognize the date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
pursuant to the company s readiness programs  all major categories of information technology systems and non information technology systems ie  equipment with embedded microprocessors in use by the company  including manufacturing  sales  financial and human resources  have been inventoried and assessed 
in addition  plans have been developed for the required systems modifications or replacements 
with respect to its information technology systems  the company has completed the entire assessment phase and approximately of the remediation phase 
with respect to its non information technology systems  the company has completed the entire assessment phase and approximately of the remediation phase 
selected areas  both internal and external  are being tested to assure the integrity of the company s remediation programs 
the testing is expected to be completed by september the company plans to have all internal mission critical information technology and non information technology systems year compliant by september the company is also communicating with its major customers  suppliers and financial institutions to assess the potential impact on the company s operations if those third parties fail to become year compliant in a timely manner 
while this process is not yet complete  based upon responses to date  it appears that many of those customers and suppliers have only indicated that they have in place year readiness programs  without specifically confirming that they will be year compliant in a timely manner 
risk assessment  readiness evaluation  action plans and contingency plans related to the company s significant customers and suppliers are expected to be completed by september the company s key financial institutions have been surveyed and it is the company s understanding that they are or will be year compliant on or before december  the costs incurred to date related to its year activities have not been material to the company  and  based upon current estimates  the company does not believe that the total cost of its year readiness programs will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s readiness programs also include the development of contingency plans to protect its business and operations from year related interruptions 
these plans should be complete by september and  by way of examples  will include back up procedures  identification of alternate suppliers  where possible  and increases in inventory levels 
based upon the company s current assessment of its non information technology systems  the company does not believe it necessary to develop an extensive contingency plan for those systems 
there can be no assurances  however  that any of the company s contingency plans will be sufficient to handle all problems or issues which may arise 
the company believes that it is taking reasonable steps to identify and address those matters that could cause serious interruptions in its business and operations due to year issues 
however  delays in the implementation of new systems  a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the company s systems and in the systems of its suppliers  customers and financial institutions  a failure of such third parties to adequately address their respective year issues  or a failure of a contingency plan could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
for example  the company would experience a material adverse impact on its business if significant suppliers of beer  glass or other raw materials  or utility systems fail to timely provide the company with necessary inventories or services due to year systems failures 
the statements set forth herein concerning year issues which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
in particular  the costs associated with the company s year programs and the time frame in which the company plans to complete year modifications are based upon management s best estimates 
these estimates were derived from internal assessments and assumptions of future events 
these estimates may be adversely affected by the continued availability of personnel and system resources  and by the failure of significant third parties to properly address year issues 
therefore  there can be no guarantee that any estimates  or other forward looking statements will be achieved  and actual results could differ significantly from those contemplated 
euro conversion issues effective january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
for three years after the introduction of the euro  the participating countries can perform financial transactions in either the euro or their original local currencies 
this will result in a fixed exchange rate among the participating countries  whereas the euro and the participating countries currency in tandem will continue to float freely against the us dollar and other currencies of the non participating countries 
the company does not believe that the effects of the conversion will have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these risks  the company periodically enters into derivative transactions including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements 
the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes 
the company uses derivative instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks 
the fair value of long term debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of long term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt  including current maturities  was approximately million at february  a hypothetical increase from prevailing interest rates at february   would result in a decrease in fair value of long term debt by approximately million 
also  a hypothetical increase from prevailing interest rates at february   would result in an approximate increase in cash required for interest on variable interest rate debt during the next five fiscal years as follows million million million million million the company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate changes relative to its long term debt 
at february   the company had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
the company has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of having international subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
the company uses local currency borrowings to hedge its earnings and cash flow exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at february   management believes that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a material adverse impact on either earnings or cash flow 
the company also has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of contracts to purchase inventory items that are denominated in various foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from these contracts  the company periodically enters into foreign exchange hedging agreements 
at february   the potential loss on outstanding foreign exchange hedging agreements from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material
