item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations throughout the following discussion  the business operated by huntway refining company is referred to as huntway and all per share data is diluted per share data 
on june   huntway merged the partnership  huntway partners lp  into a newly formed corporation  huntway refining company  effectively converting the business to corporate status 
the following should be read in conjunction with the foregoing selected financial data and the historical financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the words believes  expects  estimates  will be and similar words or expressions  identify such forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include the price of crude oil  demand for liquid asphalt and government and private funding for road construction and repair 
the companys actual results may differ materially from these forward looking statements 
results of operations huntway is principally engaged in the processing and sale of liquid asphalt products  as well as the production of other refined petroleum products such as gas oil  naphtha  kerosene distillate and bunker fuel 
huntways ability to generate income depends principally upon the margins between the prices for its refined petroleum products and the cost of crude oil  as well as upon demand for liquid asphalt  which affects both price and sales volume 
historically  refined petroleum product prices including prices for liquid asphalt  although to a lesser degree than for huntways other refined petroleum products generally fluctuate with crude oil price levels 
there has not been a relationship between total revenues and income due to the volatile commodity character of crude oil prices 
as a result  management believes that increases or decreases in revenues is not a meaningful basis for comparing historical results of operations 
management believes earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization and income taxes provides the most meaningful basis for comparing the historical results of operations discussed below 
earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization and income taxes is not a measurement criterion under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be viewed as superior to or in isolation from net income 
compared to in  huntway reported net income of  
per diluted share versus net income of  
per diluted share in net income in was net of a  income tax provision as huntway converted to corporate form effective june  no income tax provision was recorded in the prior year because huntway was operating as a partnership 
pre tax income increased to  in from  in this percent improvement in pre tax income of  between years was primarily caused by increased asphalt gross profit 
earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization and income taxes increased to  versus  in revenues declined to  in from  in while total barrels sold increased slightly to  barrels in from  barrels in the decline in revenues between periods of  or was caused by lower average product prices  which moved down with lower crude oil costs 
average per barrel product selling prices declined from in to in  a decline of or 
average per barrel product prices did not decline to the same degree as the decline in average per barrel crude oil prices due to fairly stable asphalt selling prices between periods  partially offsetting the decline in light end selling prices that declined commensurate with the fall in crude oil costs 
average asphalt selling prices declined only slightly between years despite the decline in average per barrel crude oil costs 
this was caused by stronger asphalt demand due to improved public and private construction activity in california in as well as increased sales of higher margin specialty asphalt products 
the combination of fairly stable asphalt pricing and significantly lower crude oil costs caused asphalt per barrel margins and total asphalt gross profit to increase between years 
the improved california economy caused private construction to increase in in addition  public expenditures for road construction and repair intensified in the second half of due to increased emphasis on road construction and repair by caltrans 
in addition  the effect of heavy first half el nino related rainfall compressed the asphalt season and caused even greater necessity for road repairs in the second half of caltrans is also increasingly specifying more higher margin specialized asphalt products in its projects as these products last longer and perform better than conventional paving asphalts 
in recent years a substantial amount of public transportation dollars financed by caltrans were diverted to complete earthquake related bridge retrofit work 
this work was substantially completed by and  accordingly  this resulted in increased public road repair and construction expenditures in the current year 
light end margins  on the other hand  continued to decline in versus as they had in versus the lack of any major refinery problems in and the impact of less expensive crude oil caused an oversupply of finished gasoline and diesel products in california 
relatively inexpensive crude oil costs caused refiners to run incremental barrels despite lower per barrel refining margins 
the resultant oversupply of these finished fuels reduced prices for huntways unfinished light end products as these products are priced off of finished gasoline and diesel prices 
huntways average per barrel crude oil costs declined in huntways lower per barrel crude oil costs reflect lower average california crude oil posted prices in versus partially offset by huntways mix of crude oil and its crude hedging costs 
california average crude oil postings decreased between years as a result of lower world crude oil prices 
these costs declined in response to reduced world demand for crude oil due to lower asian demand as a result of economic problems in that area of the world and overproduction relative to demand by oil producing nations 
as a result  world oil inventories increased in this fact and the perception that the supply of crude oil will continue to exceed demand in the near future caused world oil prices to collapse in cash processing costs generally include production wages and benefits  utility costs  repairs and maintenance  insurance  property taxes and environmental compliance costs 
such costs increased on an aggregate and on a per barrel basis in this increase reflects higher labor and benefits and higher heating costs due to increased natural gas prices as well as increased repair and maintenance expenditures 
other increases were due to higher environmental compliance costs 
the following table sets forth the effects of changes in price and volume on sales and materials mostly crude and processing costs for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  materials net barrels sales processing margin sold year ended december effect of changes in price    effect of changes in volume     year ended december  net margin increased in due to the decline in crude oil costs exceeding the decline in average product prices 
this favorable impact on margins reflects improved asphalt margins more than offsetting lower light end margins 
on a per barrel basis  net margin was in versus in on a per barrel basis  sales averaged in versus in  or a decline of 
material and processing costs averaged in versus in  or a decline of 
this decline reflects lower average per barrel crude oil costs between years 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the  increase was primarily due to higher incentive plan accruals  higher wage and salary costs  and higher professional fee expenses 
professional fee expenses increased due to costs incurred in converting to corporate form effective june  incentive plan accruals increased due to increased levels of profitability 
wage and salary costs increased due to the addition of a new refinery manager at the benicia refinery and normal wage increases 
net interest expense declined between years by  due to higher levels of interest income 
depreciation and amortization increased  between years due to the accounting for employee stock options issued in january effective with the conversion to corporate form on june   the operations of huntway became subject to corporate federal and state taxes on income and a provision for income taxes of  was provided for the results of operations subsequent to that date 
no such provision was made prior to that date as the taxable income or loss of the partnership was passed on to its partners 
compared to in  huntway reported net income of  or 
per unit  versus net income of  or per unit in prior year net income included a  extraordinary gain  or per unit  partially offset by transaction costs of  or 
per unit 
absent the impact of the extraordinary gain net of associated transaction costs  net income improved  between years from a loss of  in to net income of  in the improvement in net results reflects lower interest expense between periods of  partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization between years of  net interest expense declined between years due to lower average debt levels 
on december   huntways prepackaged plan of reorganization was consummated by the us bankruptcy court 
as a result  total debt and accrued interest declined  to  from  as measured at november  average debt levels in were  versus  in on october  the partnership issued  in senior subordinated secured convertible debt due  retired  in senior debt  and redeemed  units or of its total units outstanding 
the transaction also reduced the effective interest rate on the partnerships  industrial development bond from to approximately and provided the partnership with  in additional working capital 
as a result of this transaction  the partnerships debt increased from  to  effective october  net interest expense however remained essentially unchanged due to the lower net interest rate on the new convertible debt and the buydown of the approximate interest spread on the industrial development bond 
depreciation and amortization increased  between years 
this increase was due to  in amortization of deferred compensation in relating to the accounting for employee stock options issued in december earnings before interest and depreciation and amortization were  in versus  in the decrease in revenues between years to  in from  in was primarily the result of lower crude oil costs 
between years  asphalt gross profit increased in aggregate and on a per barrel basis due to the effect of the decline in crude oil costs coupled with slightly higher asphalt selling prices due to increased demand 
the expanding california economy increased demand for asphalt in the private sector 
demand for asphalt by the public sector was flat between years despite the improving california economy as some public expenditures were diverted to complete earthquake bridge and freeway overpass retrofit projects 
these projects primarily require steel and concrete and use very little asphalt 
light end margins conversely declined in versus as no major refinery problems occurred in causing the supply of finished phase ii gasoline carb california air resources board diesel products in california to exceed prior year levels 
this caused downward pressure on the prices for huntways unfinished light end products such as gas oil  kerosene distillate and naphtha 
these products are priced off of finished diesel and gasoline prices 
huntway s light end product prices also declined due to the decline in crude oil costs 
crude oil costs on a per barrel basis declined in the decline in huntways crude oil costs reflects overall lower crude costs on world markets 
the effect of iraq selling crude oil for humanitarian purposes throughout all of versus only the fourth quarter of  production by opec members above stated quotas  weaker asian demand due to economic problems in that area of the world and the effect of comparatively warmer weather in than in the eastern united states and western europe reducing heating oil demand caused downward pressure on world oil prices 
crude oil prices began to decline in the fourth quarter of and continued to reflect a relatively declining trend throughout california average crude oil postings decreased in versus this decline reflected the weakness in world oil prices 
moreover  in california oil refineries did not experience the operating difficulties that arose in particularly in the first half of as in the first half of these refineries experienced production problems as they began to produce large quantities of the new cleaner fuels phase ii gasoline and carb diesel 
as a result huntways light end margins in declined versus due to higher finished fuel inventories commensurate with increased production by major california refineries 
cash processing costs in  which include utility costs  operating salaries  wages and benefits  repair and maintenance costs  property taxes and environmental compliance costs  were comparable to on an aggregate and per barrel basis 
the following table sets forth the effects of changes in price and volume on sales and materials mostly crude and processing costs for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  materials net barrels sales processing margin sold year ended december  effect of changes in price    effect of changes in volume     year ended december  net margin increased a modest in as the decline in material and processing costs due to falling crude prices contributed to lower sales prices 
the slight increase in net margins reflects higher asphalt margins offsetting lower light end margins 
on a per barrel basis net margin per barrel was a barrel in versus in on a per barrel basis  sales averaged in versus in material and processing costs averaged in versus in the prior year 
the decline of reflects lower average crude prices between years 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the  increase primarily reflects higher salary and wage expense and higher travel expense due to increased promotion and marketing efforts 
outlook and factors that affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that may affect huntways future operations including the possibility of increases in crude oil costs that huntway may be unable to pass on to customers in the form of higher prices 
crude oil costs could rise to such an extent that huntway may not have sufficient letter of credit availability to purchase all the crude oil it needs to sustain operations to capacity  especially during the summer season 
if this occurred  huntway may be forced to prepay for crude oil or curtail refining operations  either of which could adversely impact results of operations 
the companys primary product is liquid asphalt 
some of huntways competitors produce liquid asphalt as a by product and are of greater size and have larger financial resources than the company 
accordingly  the company has in the past  and may in the future  have difficulty raising prices in the face of increasing crude oil costs 
to some of huntways competitors  the margins they receive on asphalt are not as important to their operations as asphalt margins are to huntway 
another potential risk factor concerns the demand for the companys light end products 
these products  which include naphtha  kerosene distillate and gas oil  are manufactured as part of the refining process to produce liquid asphalt 
these light end products are usually sold to larger refiners as feed stocks for their operations and are priced at a discount to finished gasoline and diesel prices 
if demand for huntways light end products were to decline it would create downward pressure on the companys light end margins or potentially stop operations if light end inventory could not be sold 
in addition  regulatory pressures of an environmental nature could negatively impact the demand for finished fuels in california  which  in turn  would reduce demand for huntways light end products 
while historically the company has had little difficulty in moving its light end production at profitable margins  the potential exists that this demand could be reduced through factors beyond the companys control 
to mitigate fluctuations in crude oil prices  huntway has negotiated hedge arrangements with independent producers of california crude oil 
huntways net cost of crude oil increased in as a result of the hedge due to falling crude oil prices 
the companys net cost of crude oil was reduced in and from what it might otherwise have been as a result of these hedge arrangements 
the january northridge earthquake destroyed a major pipeline bringing crude oil into southern california 
both of huntways california refineries are vulnerable to disruption in operations and reduced operating results due to the possibility of additional earthquakes in california 
for example  the northridge earthquake destroyed or severely damaged many bridges  overpasses and freeways in southern california 
the work to repair this damage was substantially completed by early but required primarily concrete and steel and comparatively little liquid asphalt 
future earthquakes could temporarily reduce asphalt demand if substantial damage were sustained by concrete road structures 
demand for liquid paving asphalt products is primarily affected by federal  state and local highway spending  commercial construction and the level of housing starts  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
government highway spending provides a source of demand which is relatively unaffected by normal business cycles but is dependent upon appropriations 
historically  approximately of huntways liquid asphalt sales have been made to purchasers whose business is directly tied to these various governmental expenditures 
over the long term  the demand for liquid asphalt will also tend to be influenced by changes in population  the level of commercial construction  and housing activity 
federal funding of highway projects is accomplished through the federal aid highway program 
the federal aid highway program is a federally assisted  state administered program that distributes federal funds to the states to construct and improve urban and rural highway systems 
substantially all federal highway funds are derived from gasoline user taxes assessed at the pump 
in addition to federal funding for highway projects  states individually fund transportation improvements with the proceeds of a variety of gasoline and other taxes 
in california  caltrans administers state expenditures for highway projects 
in june congress passed the billion federal highway bill  officially known as the transportation equity act for the st century  or tea the bill is estimated to increase transportation related expenditures by million a year in california alone over a six year period anticipated to begin in this will equate to a percent increase over existing funding levels 
it is anticipated that approximately million of this annual increase will relate to road construction and repair activities 
historically percent of federal gasoline taxes raised in california were returned to the state  now that figure will be percent 
in addition  in november the california electorate passed proposition proposition protects the state transportation fund by requiring that any funds borrowed from the california state transportation fund be repaid with interest within one year except in the case of a fiscal emergency 
in that case funds must be repaid within three years with interest 
such emergencies are infrequent and have occurred only twice in the th century in california 
both the federal highway bill and california proposition bode well for road construction and repair funding in california into the foreseeable future 
demographic studies suggest continued rapid growth in the population of california 
for example  recent studies suggest californias population will increase to approximately million people by up from approximately million today 
this population growth should translate into increased private and public transportation expenditures including road construction and repair 
by early the majority of the earthquake bridge retrofit work was completed 
this work was designed to strengthen many of the bridges and overpasses in the state in advance of the next earthquake  the timing of which is unknown 
as expected  caltrans expenditures on road construction and repair did increase in versus however  expenditures were delayed for the first half of due to the heavy el nino related rainfall 
as discussed above  it appears that sufficient funding will be available at the state and federal level to finance needed road construction and repair activities into the foreseeable future 
limiting factors that potentially could prevent these funds from being fully spent include the availability of necessary equipment and personnel in california to complete the work 
the strength of the california economy also influences demand for huntways asphalt and light end products 
the california economy began to recover in and has experienced continued growth through this has stimulated private demand for huntways asphalt products 
private demand for asphalt  however  constitutes only approximately of huntways annual asphalt demand 
the company believes private demand for asphalt will continue to expand for the next several years commensurate with the expected continued expansion of the california economy 
long term  huntway remains optimistic about the outlook for future growth in california  based on the level of existing expansion already underway and forecasts by several prominent economic studies 
this expected growth in the california economy should lead to continued growth in the demand for huntways products 
there can be no assurance  however  that the california economy will continue to expand as it has since or as forecasted by economic studies 
generally  cold  wet weather is not conducive to asphalt road construction 
accordingly  the company almost always experiences a loss in the first quarter of the year 
periods of unusually heavy rainfall such as occurred in the last quarter of and first five months of associated with the el nino weather phenomenon also depress asphalt demand 
however  heavy rainfall does damage asphalt roads  increasing the backlog of needed road repairs 
barriers to entry in the asphalt market are limited 
the sophistication level of the required facilities is low  indicating that existing refineries could enter the market if they chose to do so 
the capital needed to undertake asphalt manufacturing at an existing california refinery operation is small by refinery standards 
permit issues for these existing refineries  while they exist  are not of such a nature that they are likely to be a significant deterrent to new entrants 
if a major existing california refinery operation decided to produce liquid asphalt with any meaningful volume  the supply demand relationship for asphalt in california could be severely disrupted with a resultant decline in asphalt prices and margins 
however  construction of new asphalt refineries is very unlikely due to the inability to obtain required permits 
newly constructed refineries would have high barriers to entry due to environmental regulations and the limited size of the market 
the company is subject to federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that might have adverse environmental effects  and that impose liability for the costs of cleaning up  and certain damages resulting from sites of past spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous substances 
although management believes that the companys operations procedures and safety precautions are enforced stringently  there can be no assurance that environmental problems will not occur in the future 
as a result of the factors described above  while the company is generally optimistic regarding its future business prospects  the outlook is uncertain due to the nature of the business in which the company operates 
for example crude oil costs represent a large percentage of the total annual cash costs of the company ranging from to of cash costs depending on the cost of crude oil 
the company remains optimistic regarding growth in the sale of higher margin polymer based asphalt products 
as with conventional asphalt products  growth in the area of polymer sales is also dependent on funding availability that can rise and fall with the economic climate 
on an overall basis the impact of the federal highway bill and the passage of proposition in california in suggest public funding for road construction and repair should be sufficient to keep asphalt demand strong 
at the present time  private demand for asphalt also looks strong as the california economy continues to expand 
this demand probably would decline however  with any downturn in the california economic environment 
year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
management has determined that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for either its computer systems it systems or its process controls non it systems  and believes any remediation costs are not material 
any such remediation costs will be charged to operations as incurred 
the companys process controls are not computerized and do not rely upon time date sensitive control equipment 
the companys accounting and billing systems are computerized and are sensitive to the year issue 
however  these applications are being replaced and the new applications should be in place by july  in the event that these applications are not in place by the year the company believes that it has sufficient manual backup systems that could be used to prevent any material disruption of its operations 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
however  the company does not utilize any electronic data interchange directly with its customers and believes its exposure is limited to systems associated with the federal wire system  common carrier pipelines and utilities 
while there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on its operations  management does not currently anticipate significant problems with these systems and has not yet done any contingency planning pending the results of its communications with its suppliers and customers 
however  should the company be denied access to crude supplies  natural gas or other vital materials and services due to the failure of its suppliers delivery systems due to year compliance problems  it could be forced to either curtail operations or shut down until such materials can again be delivered 
additionally  should its customers be unable to make payments for their purchases  the company could be faced with a liquidity shortfall 
capital resources and liquidity the companys cash requirements and liquidity positions are affected by various factors including the selling prices for its refined products liquid asphalt and light end products and the price of crude oil 
the selling prices for asphalt products are influenced by the price of crude oil and by local market supply and demand factors for asphalt including public and private demand for road construction and improvements 
the selling prices for huntways light end products naphtha  kerosene distillate and gas oil are also strongly impacted by the price of crude oil and by supply and demand factors for finished gasoline and diesel products in california 
fluctuations in the cost of crude oil are impacted by a myriad of market factors  both foreign and domestic 
in addition  capital expenditure requirements  including costs to maintain compliance with environmental regulations as well as debt service requirements  impact the companys cash needs 
net income increased to  in from  in results in were net of a  provision for income taxes as the company converted to corporate form effective june  prior to june  huntway operated as a partnership 
no income tax provision was recorded in earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization and taxes on income increased  to  in from  in pretax income increased to  in from  in  or an increase of  this sharp rise in pre tax profits reflects significantly higher asphalt gross profit partially offset by lower light end gross profit and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
asphalt gross profit increased significantly in due to the decline in average per barrel crude oil costs between years 
despite the decline in crude oil costs  asphalt sales prices declined only slightly between years due to improved supply demand factors and increased sales of higher priced specialty asphalt products 
these higher priced specialty asphalt products are increasingly being specified in road construction projects in california especially in northern california 
asphalt margins generally increase when crude costs fall and decline when crude costs rise as asphalt pricing is generally established several months in advance of delivery and established on fixed prices 
however  partially mitigating the influences of increases or decreases in crude oil costs are certain escalators for caltrans related projects 
in addition the company seeks to partially hedge its crude oil costs 
the company estimates that of its asphalt sales are tied to caltrans contracts and are impacted by escalators relating to the cost of crude oil 
asphalt demand by both the public and private sector has increased over the past several years commensurate with the improving business climate in california 
public demand for asphalt funded primarily by caltrans increased in over as a result of substantial completion by early of earthquake related bridge retrofit work 
bridge retrofit projects utilize concrete and steel and use comparatively little asphalt 
in  as this work was nearing completion  more funds were available to be expended for road construction and repair 
moreover  in june  the billion federal highway bill was passed 
this bill is anticipated to add another million a year into california transportation related projects 
it is estimated that approximately one half of that total  or million will be added annually over each of the next six years for road construction and repair 
private demand for asphalt has also increased commensurate with the expanding california economy 
this growth in private demand for asphalt is expected to continue as long as the growth in the california economy continues 
accordingly  the company anticipates that absent any severe increases in crude oil costs that its per barrel asphalt margins should remain relatively strong 
light end margins continued to decline in due to increased inventory levels of finished gasoline and diesel in the state 
in no major refinery problems occurred and low crude oil costs caused refiners to continue to refine barrels as long as incremental margins exist 
while wholesale margins were depressed  retail margins for the major refiners continued significantly positive  providing an incentive for these larger refiners to continue to run incremental barrels 
the growing inventory levels and the perception that prices would remain low for the foreseeable future depressed wholesale finished fuel prices 
as huntways light end prices are priced at a discount to wholesale finished fuel prices margins decreased 
the company anticipates that its light end prices will increase in commensurate with an expected increase in average crude oil costs 
however  per barrel light end margins in are expected to remain below historical levels 
on june  the company converted to corporate form 
accordingly  earnings generated from june  through the end of the year were subject to state and federal taxes 
in cash income taxes of  were paid while a  deferred tax provision was recorded primarily due to excess depreciation for tax purposes on refinery assets 
commensurate with the conversion to corporate form the company sold  new shares of stock in june raising  before  in transaction costs 
on january  the company obtained a new seven year   senior debt facility 
the facility bears interest at a fixed rate of 
proceeds from the borrowings were used to retire all  of huntways then existing senior debt  to pay transaction costs and to provide the company with a small amount of working capital 
the company presently anticipates that it will also be borrowing an additional  from its existing senior lender in april to provide partial funding for improvements to its benicia refinery 
these borrowings are anticipated to be also amortized over seven years at fixed rates of interest determined at funding 
however  it is the companys present intention to repay the anticipated  in new borrowings on march  although there will be no requirement to do so 
in addition to this expected  in new borrowings  the company expects to invest another  of cash on hand to complete the improvements planned for the benicia refinery 
it is expected that these improvements to the benicia refinery will increase asphalt and light end production and improve asphalt and light end product quality 
construction of these improvements will involve the cessation of production for a period of time  estimated to be approximately days  during the second quarter of during this period  light product sales will be curtailed but asphalt sales will continue from inventory 
the blended interest rate on the  of senior debt paid off on january  was approximately 
the company anticipates that net interest expense in will only slightly exceed net interest expense in despite higher debt levels due to increased interest income 
in october the company issued  in senior subordinated secured convertible debt due the holders of the convertible debt can convert into equity at a share at any time 
huntway can force conversion after october  assuming certain trading criteria are met 
in  huntway completed a restructuring of its debt through a prepackaged plan of reorganization that was filed with the us bankruptcy court in wilmington  delaware  on november   confirmed by the court on december  and consummated on december  as a result of that transaction  huntway reduced debt and accrued interest by  as measured at november  huntway recorded a  extraordinary gain on the transaction excluding  in related transaction costs 
the partnership also recorded a  capital contribution on the transaction represented by a decrease in debt and an increase in partners capital 
the average interest rate and weighted average debt outstanding during each of the past three years was as follows average interest weighted average rate debt outstanding cash increased to  at december  from  at december  this  increase in cash can be primarily attributed to net income of  plus depreciation and amortization of  less additions to property of  and repayments of long term obligations of net cash provided by operating activities totaled  in net income of  plus depreciation and amortization of  deferred income taxes of  and interest expense paid by the issuance of notes of  provided a combined  in cash 
increases in accrued liabilities primarily relating to increased incentive plan accruals and higher pension and profit sharing k accruals provided  in cash 
incentive plan accruals increased due to increased levels of profitability 
cash was also generated from decreases in inventory of  the decrease in inventory reflects the decrease in the average cost of crude oil between years 
accounts receivable decreased and provided  in cash and reflected lower light end revenues due to depressed finished fuel prices 
prepaid expenses decreased and provided  in cash and reflected lower insurance and turnaround costs 
accounts payable declined using  in cash and reflects lower crude oil costs 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled  in net income of  plus depreciation and amortization of  and interest expense paid by the issuance of notes of  provided a combined  in cash 
decreases in accounts receivable generated  in cash and were caused by the timing of light end sales between years 
inventory increased using  in cash 
this increase reflects higher crude and finished goods inventory at benicia due to the timing of light end sales and lower than expected asphalt sales in december due to effects of wet weather 
prepaid expenses decreased providing  in cash and primarily reflects lower prepaid turnaround expenses as no major repair projects were incurred in accounts payable decreased using  in cash primarily due to the effect of lower crude oil prices between years 
accrued liabilities decreased using  in cash 
this decline reflects lower sunbelt related accruals substantially offset by higher interest expense accruals 
investing activities used  in cash in property additions were comprised of completion of the waste water treatment facility at the wilmington refinery as well as other smaller improvements at the wilmington refinery 
improvements at the benicia refinery consisted of engineering and other costs relating to the benicia improvement project  storage tank improvements  improvements to the modified asphalt facility and other smaller additions 
additions to other assets primarily consisted of deposits  additions to computer software and environmental manuals and plans 
investment activities used  in cash in property additions reflect construction of the wastewater treatment facility at the wilmington refinery  construction of a pipeline to a customer at the wilmington refinery and costs to relocate the railroad loading rack at the wilmington refinery 
at benicia costs were incurred to improve the asphalt storage and delivery systems  to double bottom certain storage tanks  to replace heat exchangers  to purchase new heaters  to construct new pipelines and several other projects 
in addition  other assets increased  in and primarily relate to costs associated with raising  in convertible debt 
financing activities used  in cash in and related to reductions of debt of  in addition  a net  in cash was generated from the sale of  shares in june commensurate with conversion to corporate form 
cash flows from financing activities in generated  in cash 
the october sale of convertible debt generated  in cash while  in payments were made to the state of arizona relating to the sunbelt environmental compliance agreement 
as of march   one payment of  remains to be made on the agreement and is due in january the sale of  in convertible debt in october significantly improved huntways capital structure and provided the company with  in cash 
in addition it reduced required principal payments by  in on conversion of the convertible debt  total debt would decline  while annual interest expense would decline by  the new senior loan facility obtained in january amortizes over an month period beginning in february monthly payments on the debt including principal and interest total approximately  interest paid on the convertible debt notes is due on a semi annual basis payable  on june and  on december scheduled fixed principal and cash interest payments in total  principal and cash interest payments totaled  in and  in the company has a  letter of credit facility to support crude oil purchases through december  the company is presently negotiating with several banks to obtain a replacement letter of credit facility that will run beyond and expects to have this new facility in place by the second half of fees on the existing letter of credit facility are management continues to address all areas of the companys operations in an effort to reduce costs  improve profitability and to provide a sound basis for future operations 
this evaluation resulted in the decision in to temporarily suspend operations at its sunbelt refinery located in coolidge  arizona  until such time as there is a sustained improvement in market conditions 
the primary factors involved in the companys decision were poor margins at the facility  a limitation on working capital availability and  to a lesser extent  the impact of an environmental lawsuit and investigations filed by the state of arizona which was settled in the company may eventually reopen the refinery as a terminal when market conditions improve or it may sell the facility 
the company believes its current level of letter of credit facilities are sufficient to guarantee requirements for crude oil purchases  collateralization of other obligations and for hedging activities at current crude price levels 
however  due to the volatility in the price of crude oil there can be no assurance that these facilities will be adequate in the future 
if crude oil prices increased beyond the level of the companys letter of credit facilities  it would be required to prepay for crude oil or reduce its crude oil purchases  either of which would adversely impact profitability 
management believes cash on hand and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet liquidity needs in and for the foreseeable future 
however  due to the volatility in the price of crude oil there can be no assurance that sufficient amounts of cash will be available to meet operating requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as previously noted  the companys profitability depends largely on the spread between market prices for its refined products and its crude oil costs 
a substantial and prolonged decrease in this overall spread would have a significant negative effect on the companys earnings  financial position and cash flows 
approximately half of huntways production consists of light products and half of asphalts 
the prices of huntways light products have historically followed changes in crude oil prices over to month time periods despite high short term volatility 
managements believes that approximately of huntways asphalt unit sales volume will be covered by contractual escalation and deescalation clauses with various state highway agencies  which are based upon various crude oil cost indexes 
in an effort to mitigate the remaining risk  the company enters into contracts intended to partially hedge its exposure to crude oil price fluctuations 
historically  such contracts are zero cost collars under which the company receives or makes a monthly payment if crude oil prices for the month rise above  or fall below  the contracts ceiling or floor levels  respectively 
as of december   the company had entered into such an arrangement for all of and covering approximately of its expected crude oil requirements over that period 
the companys maximum exposure payments under this contract is approximately  per month 
the company does not enter into such arrangements for trading or other speculative purposes
