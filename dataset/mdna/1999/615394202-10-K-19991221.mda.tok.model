on october   the company acquired a shareholding of hydrolux sarl  a luxembourg manufacturer and designer of hydraulic power control systems for industrial machinery from paul wurth sarl 
as part of the transaction  the company increased its ownership to of moog hydrolux hydraulic systems  inc moog hydrolux  a joint venture the company formed in fiscal with hydrolux sarl to serve the north american market 
the company previously owned of moog hydrolux 
after the transaction  paul wurth sarl owns the remaining minority interest in hydrolux sarl and moog hydrolux 
the purchase price was million in cash  plus the assumption of million of debt 
on november   the company completed the acquisition from raytheon aircraft company of all the outstanding common stock of raytheon aircraft montek company montek for approximately million in cash 
montek  located in salt lake city  utah  supplies flight controls to the boeing commercial airplane group and manufacturers of regional and business jets 
montek also produces steering controls for tactical missiles and servovalves for both industrial and aerospace applications 
on december   the company acquired a shareholding in microset srl  an italian manufacturer and designer of electronic controls for industrial machinery for million in cash 
hydrolux sarl  moog hydrolux and microset srl are referred to as the acquired industrial businesses 
effective with the first quarter of  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the company s reportable segments under sfas no 
are aircraft controls  satellite and launch vehicle controls and industrial controls 
the determination of the company s reportable segments was based on an analysis of the organizational structure of the company and its products  as well as markets served 
prior periods information has been presented to conform to the new presentation of segment information 
compared with consolidated 
sales for were million  up from million in the current year acquisition of montek accounted for the majority of the increase 
in the ten months since the acquisition  montek had million in sales  the majority of which were controls for aircraft 
sales in also included incremental sales of the acquired industrial businesses totaling million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales decreased by million due to the winding down of the b bomber and f fighter aircraft programs along with declines in deliveries to boeing  due to their reduced production rates 
cost of sales in was of sales compared with of sales in the improvement is due to a favorable product mix of sales in resulting from a greater share of aircraft flight control aftermarket sales along with a greater proportion of work on higher margin launch vehicle and tactical missile programs 
this improvement was offset by higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales percentage points associated with the acquired industrial businesses and the satellite controls business 
research and development expenses increased by million in to million  or of sales 
approximately half of the dollar increase was associated with the development of next generation flight controls 
the current year acquisitions and efforts in industrial controls related to developing the next generation direct drive valve and turbine products accounted equally for the remainder of the increase 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in compared to million in while as a percentage of sales  sg a remained at of net sales 
the acquisitions accounted for over of the absolute dollar increase 
interest expense increased million in to million due to significantly higher average outstanding borrowings resulting from the indebtedness incurred to finance the first quarter acquisitions 
the company s effective tax rate for was compared to a year ago 
the current year tax rate reflects higher foreign tax credit benefits resulting from distributions from the company s german subsidiary

sales in aircraft controls increased to million in as compared to million in the acquisition of montek provided significant growth to aircraft controls sales and contributed to operating margin improvement during for the ten months since the acquisition  montek contributed million to aircraft controls sales 
approximately of montek s aircraft controls book of business relates to controls for commercial airplane applications  primarily the boeing series airplanes 
also contributing to the overall sales improvement was an increase of million in aftermarket sales from the company s pre acquisition businesses  primarily related to controls for military applications 
these increases were offset by anticipated declines in sales on the b bomber and f fighter aircraft programs  as they near completion  and pre acquisition boeing oem business 
the company recently began initial production on the f a e f super hornet and the v osprey  which over the long term  will help offset the completion of the f and b programs 
although the company s total boeing oem business increased in due to the montek acquisition  reduced production rates of the and slowed deliveries of pre acquisition products to boeing 
operating margins for aircraft controls were in compared to in the main reason for the margin improvement is the acquisition of montek  which has higher margins than the company s pre acquisition operations 
the higher margins reflect montek s book of business containing a greater percentage of aftermarket sales  which typically carry higher margins than sales to oems 
for the ten months since its acquisition  of montek s sales related to spares  parts and repair services 
including the acquisition  aircraft controls aftermarket sales represented of total sales in compared to in this improvement was tempered by million of increased research and development costs associated with the development of next generation flight controls 
backlog for aircraft controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the increase is due to the acquisition of montek  offset by lower pre acquisition business resulting from production rate declines at boeing and certain military programs winding down 
backlog consists of that portion of open orders for which sales are expected to be recognized over the next twelve months 
satellite and launch vehicle controls 
sales in satellite and launch vehicle controls were million in  up from million in sales of controls for tactical missiles increased million in the current year with of that increase resulting from the acquisition of montek for controls on the hellfire  tow and popeye tactical missile programs 
on the strength of the titan iv  delta family of launch vehicles and the national missile defense system  sales of launch vehicle steering controls increased million 
these increases were offset by lower sales of satellite controls due to a general softness in the satellite market 
operating margins for satellite and launch vehicle controls were in compared to in operating margins for launch vehicle and tactical missile products improved as the mix in favored more mature production programs and significant expenditures were made in on launch vehicle development programs 
these favorable developments were mostly offset by lower sales and margins that deteriorated in satellite controls  which represents of the group s sales 
backlog for satellite and launch vehicle controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the increase relates to controls for tactical missiles resulting from the acquisition of montek 
industrial controls 
sales in industrial controls increased to million in from million in the acquired industrial businesses accounted for million with hydrolux sarl and moog hydrolux adding million in sales of hydraulic controls and microset contributing million in sales of electric controls 
montek  which produces industrial servovalves  accounted for the remainder of the industrial controls sales increase 
operating margins for industrial controls were in and an increase in margins of percentage points in the company s pre acquisition businesses is attributable to favorable product mix resulting from higher sales of electric controls for military ground vehicles and industrial hydraulic controls in europe 
this increase was offset by losses incurred by the acquired industrial businesses reflecting lower than anticipated sales due to a downturn in the injection molding machinery market 
backlog for industrial controls was million at september  compared to million at september  decreases in orders for controls for military ground vehicles and entertainment simulators offset backlog associated with the acquired industrial businesses and montek 
compared with consolidated 
net sales for increased to million as compared to million in sales in aircraft controls increased million reflecting higher sales of controls for the boeing series airplanes  regional and business jets  the f fighter aircraft and military programs entering initial production 
within satellite and launch vehicle controls  the february schaeffer acquisition  which contributed approximately million in sales  and increased launch vehicle activity resulted in a million increase in sales 
sales in industrial controls increased million led by higher volumes of controls for turbines  electric controls for military ground vehicles and entertainment simulators 
cost of sales in was of sales compared with in approximately million was incurred in satellite and launch vehicle controls associated with certain manufacturing issues including a defect on a propulsion system isolation valve and unfavorable cost experience on a fixed price development contract for the atlas centaur launch vehicle program 
in addition  margins declined due to an unfavorable product mix towards lower margin development and production programs related to commercial airplane applications 
research and development expenditures increased by million in to million  or of net sales  primarily due to million of additional effort related to the development of next generation flight controls within aircraft controls and  to a lesser extent  activity in satellite and launch vehicle controls related to various satellite constellations 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in  compared to million  or  in the decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to growth in sales  in addition to a shift of costs approximately million to production and research and development activities in from related bid and proposal work in within aircraft controls  which was recorded in sg a 
interest expense decreased by million to million in  as compared to the decline is due to lower average borrowings outstanding resulting from the use of proceeds from the equity offering completed in february the effective tax rate for was compared with in the tax rate was unusually low due to substantial foreign tax credit benefits resulting from the distribution of earnings from the company s german subsidiary  and a higher share of earnings being generated in countries with lower tax rates 
for  net earnings increased to million compared with million in basic eps increased to in compared to in  while diluted eps increased to in compared with in aircraft controls 
sales for aircraft controls increased to million in compared to million in initial production of controls for the v osprey and f a e f military programs added million to sales while increased production rates on the boeing series airplanes improved sales by million 
the majority of the remaining increase was due to increased volume for secondary and leading edge actuation on the f and f fighter aircraft 
operating margins for aircraft controls in were compared to in the decrease is the result of million in increased research and development expenses incurred in related to the development of next generation flight controls 
backlog for aircraft controls at september  was million compared to million at september  satellite and launch vehicle controls 
sales for satellite and launch vehicle controls increased to million in from million in the increase was due to increased launch vehicle activity  which added million in sales  the acquisition of schaeffer  which contributed million in incremental revenues  and million of increased sales of controls for tactical missiles 
these increases helped offset a sales decline in satellite propulsion hardware related to reduced incoming order activity associated with customers high inventory levels and the slowdown in the asian pacific economies 
launch vehicle activity during was strong particularly on the atlas centaur  kistler commercial launch vehicle and titan iv programs 
operating margins for satellite and launch vehicle controls were in compared to in approximately half of the decrease was associated with certain manufacturing issues including a defect on a propulsion system isolation valve and unfavorable cost experience on a fixed price development contract for the atlas centaur launch vehicle 
the remaining decrease is primarily due to increased research and development activities related to various satellite constellations 
backlog for satellite and launch vehicle controls was million at september  compared with million at september  the increase is due primarily to launch vehicles  in particular the titan iv program  and the schaeffer acquisition  which added approximately million 
industrial controls 
sales for industrial controls increased to million in compared to million in despite lower average currency values  particularly in germany and the asian pacific 
sales in  at constant dollars  increased  or million 
in the united states  sales of controls for hydraulic applications increased million on growth in controls for turbines  flight training simulators and material testing equipment 
higher volumes for entertainment simulators and controls for carpet tufting equipment and military ground vehicles helped increase sales of controls for electric applications by million 
internationally  sales growth of million was primarily in germany 
approximately million of the increase was due to higher volume in controls for hydraulic applications  principally turbine and plastics controls  and million related to increased volume of electric controls for military ground vehicles 
operating margins for industrial controls were in compared to in the increase was due primarily to higher sales allowing for better absorption of fixed costs 
in addition  approximately million of write offs and transition costs were incurred in to allow the company to compete more effectively in markets for electric controls 
backlog for industrial controls at september  was million compared to million at september  the increase from a year ago is attributable to growth in orders for electric controls for military ground vehicles and controls for hydraulic applications in europe 
financial condition and liquidity in connection with the acquisition of montek  the company refinanced its us credit facilities 
effective november   the company entered into a million corporate revolving and term loan agreement credit facility with a banking group 
the credit facility provides a million revolving facility and a million term loan with interest starting at libor plus basis points  with the spread adjusted based on leverage 
the credit facility is for a five year period with quarterly principal payments on the term loan of million  which commenced in march the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s us assets 
the loan agreement includes customary covenants for a transaction of this nature  including maintaining various financial ratios 
the credit facility was used primarily to acquire montek and to refinance approximately million of existing revolving credit facilities with the remaining balance available for future working capital requirements 
cash on hand at september  was million 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million a year ago 
the increase in cash from operations is due primarily to improved earnings as adjusted for non cash charges and lower growth in working capital  specifically with respect to receivables and inventories 
the company expects cash from operations in to be comparable with long term debt increased million to million at september  the percentage of long term debt to capitalization increased to from at september  these increases are a direct result of financing the first quarter acquisitions 
at september   the company had million of unused borrowing capacity under short and long term lines of credit  including million from the credit facility 
net property  plant and equipment increased million to million at september  from million at september  the current year acquisitions added approximately million to net property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures in were million compared with depreciation and amortization of million 
capital expenditures in were million compared to depreciation and amortization of million 
capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million 
the company believes its cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under short and long term lines of credit  will continue to be sufficient to meet its operating needs 
year as the end of the century nears  there is widespread concern around the world that many existing computer programs that use only the last two digits to refer to a year will not properly recognize a year that begins with digits instead of if not corrected  the concern is that many computer applications might fail  creating erroneous results or cause unanticipated system failures  among other problems 
in fiscal the company initiated activities  including designating a year project team to be responsible for specific information technology it environments  to ensure its year readiness 
in addition  communications were made to all non it functional areas to initiate a process of review and remediation of year issues in those areas 
the main business system  which encompasses manufacturing  engineering and accounting and is used by approximately of the company  has been reviewed and tested and is considered to be year compliant 
however certain auxiliary business applications required changes to ensure year compliance  the most significant of which involved the company s human resource information system which was put in place and was operational on october  and cost approximately million 
the costs associated with remediating the remaining auxiliary business applications were not material 
the company also evaluated and tested product systems ie  cad cam systems  personal computing  data entry and communication hardware and software and systems associated with facilities management 
although certain upgrades or replacements were made  many were previously scheduled and the timing was not materially impacted by the year issue 
the year costs associated with these systems were not material 
the company uses large computerized numerical control cnc machines  which are critical to the manufacturing process 
confirmation of year compliance with respect to these machines has been obtained from the company s vendors 
the company also sent letters to its critical vendors who provide materials  supplies and components inquiring about their year efforts 
only a small portion of the company s products contain embedded processors or depend upon date logic 
with respect to those that do  the company identified certain software that required upgrading or replacement  which has been completed 
the cost of upgrading or replacement was not material 
the company has completed remedial activity as it relates to the systems deemed critical 
activities related to less critical operations  which will continue until the end of  include the installation of compliant releases of desktop  voice mail  data entry software and monitoring the progress of any critical suppliers who are still working to complete their year plans 
the cost associated with these activities is not expected to be material 
the company has contingency plans that address specific critical operations that are not expected  or likely  to experience problems 
the contingency plans include the use of backup systems as well as manual processes to ensure continuity of business operations 
the company believes that it is taking the necessary steps to ensure the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially impact the company s results of operations or adversely affect relationships with customers  vendors and others 
the company believes the greatest potential risk from the year issue relates to suppliers or customers whose systems may not be year compliant and who may not be able to accept shipment of the company s products until they correct their year problems 
outlook sales in are expected to increase modestly in each of the company s three operating groups 
aircraft controls should continue to see increases in production rates on the f a e f while a full year of montek and new commercial aircraft business awarded by boeing will offset the decline in the commercial aircraft production rate at boeing that began in satellite and launch vehicle controls sales are expected to grow on increased revenues from the national missile defense program and involvement on the space station 
sales of industrial controls are expected to grow on the continuing strength of turbine controls and metal forming and a recovery in sales of servovalves to the plastics industry 
in addition  industrial controls should benefit from new product introductions and partnering arrangements with some well established suppliers of motion control devices 
operating margins are expected to improve as the company continues the process of improving the cost structures related to the businesses acquired in as well as satellite control products 
the company is also focusing on its other operations to ensure their cost structures are appropriate in relation to expected sales while allowing for continued margin improvement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of business  has exposures to interest rate risks from its long term debt obligations and foreign exchange rate risk with respect to its foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
to minimize these risks  the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps and forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
in connection with the montek acquisition and refinancing of the company s us credit facilities  the company s borrowings under variable interest rate facilities have increased by million to million at september  the credit facility under which the borrowings are outstanding has an interest rate of libor plus basis points 
in order to provide for interest rate protection  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements for million  effectively converting this amount into fixed rate debt at 
if libor were to change by  the impact on consolidated interest expense from the company s floating rate debt would be approximately million annually 
the majority of the company s sales  expenses and cash flows are transacted in us dollars 
the company does have some market risk exposure with respect to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as it relates to the value of the us dollar versus the british pound  the japanese yen and the euro 
if foreign exchange rates were to collectively weaken against the us dollar by  net earnings would be reduced by approximately million related to currency exchange rate translation exposures and 
million related to pressures on operating margins for products sourced in non us countries 
the company periodically uses forward contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party raw material purchases  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans 
the company periodically uses forward contracts to reduce fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in  and long term advances to  subsidiaries 
at september  there were no contracts outstanding 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which must be adopted by fiscal under this standard  companies are required to carry all derivatives in the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  the reason for holding it 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements
