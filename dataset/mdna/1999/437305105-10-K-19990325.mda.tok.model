capacity constraints forced the company to outsource production of the products acquired in the tenex asset acquisition at a higher cost as compared to in house manufacturing

the company acquired tamor plastics corporation  and its affiliated product distribution company  houseware sales  inc the tamor acquisition effective january  the two companies were merged to form tamor corporation tamor

income taxes 
the company was able to use federal net operating loss carryforwards  and the elimination of its valuation allowance to reduce the federal tax liability to zero 
the valuation allowance was eliminated as a result of the company s determination that it was more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded would be realized

capital resources and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at december  were million as compared to million at december  the increase in cash is partially the result of a change in the mechanics of the company s primary credit facility 
prior to the may refinancing as defined below the company was required to remit collected funds on a daily basis to repay borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
the daily sweeps of cash were no longer required after the company s primary credit facility was refinanced with new lenders in may all available cash is invested in overnight eurodollar sweeps which earn approximately per annum 
the company s financial structure has significantly changed since to complete the acquisition of seymour housewares in early the company increased its borrowings to include a million revolving line of credit  and million of term loans 
in may the company refinanced all of its debt so as to provide a more stable platform to implement its consolidation strategy 
on may  the company issued million of senior subordinated notes the notes due in proceeds from the offering were used to prepay approximately million of indebtedness primarily from previous acquisitions and fund certain transaction costs 
concurrently with the offering  the company entered into a revolving credit agreement in the maximum principal amount of million the revolver which replaced the company s prior million revolving credit facility 
the notes and the revolver are collectively referred to herein as the may refinancing 
availability under the revolver as of december  was million 
the notes and the revolver each contain various affirmative  negative and financial covenants 
the company was in compliance with all covenants related to the notes and the revolver as of december  in august the company used million of available funds from the revolver to complete the tenex asset acquisition

the term loan  along with million of available funds from the revolver were used to complete the newell asset acquisition 
capital spending of million in was used to acquire molds to support new product introductions  additional injection molding machines and to purchase the company s missouri manufacturing warehouse facility which was previously leased 
the company s capital spending needs in are expected to be between and million 
capital projects anticipated for include upgrading computer hardware and software  additional injection molding machines  a warehouse expansion and new molds to support product development 
where possible  management will pursue alternative means of financing such as capital leases and purchase money transactions 
in addition  operating leases will be pursued to the extent it represents an attractive economic alternative 
the company believes its existing financing facilities together with its cash flow from operations will provide sufficient capital to fund operations  make the required debt repayments and meet the anticipated capital spending needs 
management intends to continue to pursue its consolidation strategy within the housewares industry 
the ability to successfully fund future acquisitions will depend on the financial situation of the target company  the availability of funds under the revolver  the possibility of obtaining additional financing  and the ability to use company stock in lieu of cash 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to only accept two digit entries in the date code field and can not distinguish st century dates from th century dates and  as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
state of readiness 
the company is in the process of finalizing its evaluation of the year readiness the project of its information technology systems it and its non it systems  non it such as building security  heating and cooling  telephones  voicemail  and other similar items 
the company currently anticipates that the project will cover the following phases i identification of all it and non it systems  ii assessment of the repair or replacement requirements  iii repair or replacement  iv testing  v implementation and vi creation of contingency plans in the event of year failures 
the company is scheduled to have reached year compliance for all it and non it systems prior to december the company is also working with its major suppliers and customers to determine whether the year problem will have an adverse effect on the company s relationships with them 
the company does not control its suppliers or customers  and relies on a variety of utilities  telecommunication companies  banks and other suppliers in order to continue its business 
there is no assurance that such parties will not suffer a year business interruption  which  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and its results of operations 
costs 
to date  the company has not incurred significant expenditures in connection with the identification and evaluation of the year compliance issues 
management estimates that the year compliance costs will be approximately million to million 
funds for the year compliance will be obtained from current operations or the company s revolving credit facility

the company has not yet finalized its year contingency plan 
the company intends to finalize its contingency plan prior to december in addition  if further year compliance issues are discovered  the company will evaluate the need for one or more contingency plans relating to such issues 
management outlook and commentary s operating and financial performance included the successful completion of the following initiatives three acquisitions were integrated into the hpi family 
cost reductions were achieved  operations streamlined and profitability improved 
together  the acquisitions added sales of million and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of million the continual pruning of products offered for sale resulted in a reduction of net sales for those products sold in but an improvement in bottom line profitability 
about of the company s sales were eliminated 
profitability was improved as operating margins went from in to in the company refinanced its revolving line of credit and term financing 
the net result was a reduction in interest rates of about basis points and a more flexible  less restrictive loan agreement 
the company successfully placed a million senior subordinated note offering 
the placement of the notes was instrumental in allowing for a favorable refinancing of the company s other financing arrangements 
the company sold its home improvement business shutters  inc effective as of december  management expects to be a challenging year but one that has the potential to provide increasing rewards to shareholders and associates 
many opportunities will be pursued and strategic initiatives begun 
some of these items together with assorted factors that may influence the performance of the company in and beyond are as follows the tenex asset acquisition and the newell asset acquisition will add significantly to sales 
it is expected that these acquired product lines will add million of revenues in the company will continue to introduce new products 
products introduced at the january housewares show have already received placement with retailers and have begun shipping in the first quarter of during the third quarter of the company made two acquisitions the tenex asset acquisition and the newell asset acquisition 
these two entities only contributed million to the bottom line results when related financing costs and goodwill amortization are considered 
they do  however  represent significant opportunities for future earnings growth 
the product line obtained from tenex will be manufactured by outside vendors until mid the company is in the process of adding productive capacity and warehousing to its chicago facility to accommodate the manufacturing of this line 
once the company is able to self manufacture the tenex products  margins on this line are expected to improve 
the newell asset acquisition obtained two new product lines pi and ahp 
pi has sufficient margins  new product development and is a leader in its industry 
no immediate actions are planned for this line other than to use other company resources to expand distribution 
the ahp line of products  however  represents a significant opportunity for the company 
under previous ownership  new product development of the food storage line was stagnant and the product line faced competitive challenges 
as a result  the line experienced declines in sales and profits as it attempted to compete on price alone 
it is the company s intention to develop new products and to invest in a new brand name for the line 
management expects that this will enhance the product line s ability to compete  reverse its unfavorable sales trend and improve margins 
this process has begun but may not provide meaningful returns until late in  management plans to finalize and execute its plans to balance the production levels of its manufacturing facilities 
at present  some factories are at capacity and others are not 
the goal will be to better utilize the facilities to minimize costs 
this opportunity is a direct result of the company s acquisition activity 
as the company entered  all facilities were close to maximum capacity 
facilities acquired during provide an opportunity to move production from one facility to another as well as to consider bringing in house certain production performed by outside vendors 
facilities in minnesota acquired in the newell asset acquisition are only at of their molding capacity 
the remaining will be used to produce other general storage and closet items 
the result of this effort is expected to favorably impact margins in the nd half of and beyond 
the company is adding manufacturing capacity for its storage line of products 
injection molding machines were added to the company s chicago facility in early not only will this allow the company to bring additional production in house  but also it allows the company to replace older machines with more efficient machines 
this initiative will allow the company to increase its margins by reducing manufacturing time and cost 
a  square foot warehouse is being added in chicago to reduce the company s warehousing costs 
the company s primary raw materials are plastic resin  steel  fabric and corrugated packaging 
fluctuations in the cost of these materials can have a significant impact on reported results 
management does not expect to see a significant change in the cost of these materials during however  the cost of these items is affected by many variables outside the control of the company and changes to the current perceived trends are possible 
the company operates in a dynamic competitive environment 
many competitors  some of which with fewer resources than the company  have taken advantage of raw material price cuts to propose price decreases to customers 
as a result  the company has matched or exceeded such proposals 
the net effect of this is that much of the benefit of raw material price decreases has been passed through to customers 
this trend may continue in further  if raw material costs were to increase  there can be no guarantee that the company could successfully pass the increases along to customers 
the company distributes its products primarily in the eastern and midwest regions of the united states 
distribution to the western united states is inhibited by the lack of any regional distribution or manufacturing facilities 
freight costs make distribution from the company s other facilities unprofitable 
during  management will continue to evaluate the feasibility of expanding its manufacturing and distribution capabilities to the west 
this could represent a significant growth opportunity for the company 
one component of the company s acquisition strategy is to combine acquired entities into existing operating platforms 
in this way  fixed expenses are effectively leveraged and minimized 
for the most recent acquisitions  this process is not yet complete 
during  management will complete certain integration efforts resulting in a reduction of operating expenses as a percent of net sales and improved operating results 
in early  caldor  a regional retailer in the northeast  announced plans to close all of its stores and liquidate assets 
caldor was a significant customer of the company in generating sales of about million 
management expects that substantial revenue generated from caldor will be lost 
caldor has announced plans to sell some of its stores to retailers who are customers of the company 
over time  this will lessen the impact of the caldor liquidation 
at december   the company recorded a bad debt loss to fully address potential collection issues resulting from caldor s liquidation 
the company has financed previous acquisitions primarily with debt 
as a result the company is highly leveraged with total debt representing about of the company s book capitalization  or a debt to capital ratio 
earnings could be materially impacted by changes in interest rates 
management expects that cash flow from operations will be more than sufficient to fund needed capital improvements and new product development 
during  the company refinanced its lines of credit including a reduction in interest rates and a loosening of various financial covenants 
the company was well within its financial covenants in and expects to operate well within the covenants in hpi is a consolidator within the housewares industry 
as such  management will continue to seek strategic acquisitions of companies and product lines that fit within the desired categories of products for the home 
the company has the ability to finance some acquisition activity under its current lines of credit 
management will also consider issuing stock in lieu of cash where possible 
management believes additional lines of credit are available from its current lending partners subject to the earnings contribution of particular acquisition targets 
year computer compliance issues have been addressed 
where necessary  new systems are in the process of being installed 
all new systems are expected to be fully operational by mid the cost of these new systems was primarily funded in remaining installation costs will be less than million
