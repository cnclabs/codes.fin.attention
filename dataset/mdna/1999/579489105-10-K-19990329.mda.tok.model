item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent events and trends in  the company changed from a calendar year to a fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest december accordingly  the company s results are reported through december  versus december for this change did not materially affect net income 
on march  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of cowles media company cowles in a transaction valued at per cowles share and the assumption of million in existing cowles debt 
cowles publishes the star tribune newspaper  which serves the twin cities of minneapolis and st 
paul 
cowles also owned four separate subsidiaries that publish business magazines  special interest magazines and home improvement books 
simultaneously with the closing of the cowles merger  the company sold the magazine and book publishing subsidiaries 
the combined proceeds  plus debt and other liabilities assumed by the buyers in those transactions  were million 
the company used these proceeds to repay debt associated with the cowles merger 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company valued the non newspaper businesses at fair market value based upon the net after tax proceeds received by the company on march   and accordingly  did not realize a gain or loss on the sale 
in connection with the merger  the company paid of the consideration by issuing  shares of class a common stock in exchange for cowles shares and paid cash for the remaining shares 
the class a shares were exchanged using a ratio of shares of mcclatchy class a common for each cowles share 
the company obtained bank debt through a syndicate of banks and financial institutions to finance the cash requirements of the merger and to refinance its existing debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of the star tribune have been included in the company s results beginning march  the primary asset retained by the company following the cowles transaction is the star tribune  the largest newspaper in minnesota with daily circulation of  and sunday circulation of  as of march  it is now the company s largest newspaper 
on december  the company declared a five for four stock split in the form of a stock dividend which was paid on january  all outstanding shares and per share amounts have been restated in this discussion to reflect the stock dividend 
in october  the company announced that it had entered into agreements in principle to sell five community newspapers 
in december  the company completed the sale of the ellensburg daily record and recorded a pre tax gain of million in other non operating expenses income 
in february  the sale of the remaining four newspapers was completed 
also in the fourth quarter of  the company sold legi tech  its on line legislative tracking company as well as other non strategic real estate assets 
the company recorded a nonrecurring pre tax gain of million in non operating expenses income for its dispositions 
in the third and fourth quarters of  the company sold two commercial printing operations  a weekly newspaper  a monthly magazine and two niche publications with revenues totaling million 
the net gain on these sales was not material to results 
effective january   the company began accounting for newsprint inventories by the first in  first out fifo method  whereas in all prior years inventories were valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
the company adopted fifo accounting for newsprint inventory to provide for a better matching of revenues and expenses 
additionally  the change will enable the financial reporting to parallel the way management assesses the financial and operational performance of its newspapers 
the company has restated financial statements of prior years to apply the new method retroactively and  accordingly  retained earnings as of december  increased by  to reflect the restatement 
the effect of the accounting change on results and results for prior years is not material 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income  which requires that an enterprise report  by major components and as a single total  the change in its net assets during the period from non owner sources 
the company has no items of comprehensive income  hence comprehensive income and net income are equal 
sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise s business segments and related disclosures about its products  services  geographic area  and major customers  and no 
employers disclosure about pensions and other post retirement benefits  which revises the disclosures about pension and other post retirement benefits  have been adopted by the company in and did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
during  the fasb issued sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires that all derivatives be carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
this statement will become effective in the company s fiscal year while adoption of this statement is not expected to materially impact the company s financial results  management has not determined the impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
results of operations compared to net income was million or per share in compared to million or per share in results in includes a gain of cents per share on sales of operations 
the results include the star tribune newspaper s results and reflect dilution from acquisition related expenses including amortization of intangibles  depreciation  interest and higher income taxes 
also  the number of weighted average shares outstanding increased in  primarily as a result of class a stock issued in connection with the acquisition of the star tribune 
revenues increased million  with million coming from the star tribune march december  
total revenues excluding the star tribune increased 
however  management estimates that excluding operations sold in and  and giving effect to the four days of december through december   to make the years comparable  revenue would have increased to underlying revenue growth 
much of the underlying revenue growth at the company s operations reflect advertising rate increases at most newspapers and growth in other revenues such as online services  direct mail  commercial printing and non newspaper revenues primarily from the newspaper network 
operating revenues in thousands change california newspapers   minnesota newspaper  nm carolinas newspapers   northwest newspapers   non newspaper operations     nm nm not meaningful california the california newspapers generated of revenues and increased million or  and would have increased excluding the four community newspapers sold in february the sacramento bee  the fresno bee and the modesto bee newspapers are the company s primary operations in california and recorded million in higher advertising revenues 
circulation revenues declined million as the newspapers did not implement circulation price increases in  but rather discounted prices to increase subscriber volume 
management estimates that revenues in the region would have increased in the range if it had not changed to fiscal year reporting 
minnesota the star tribune s revenues of million include advertising revenues of million and circulation revenues of million 
on a proforma basis  the star tribune s revenues were up 
the change in the company s period reporting had little affect on revenue comparisons as the star tribune was on a similar fiscal period in carolinas the carolinas newspapers contributed of total company revenue and reported a million or increase in total revenues 
the news observer in raleigh and the company s three smaller dailies in south carolina generate the majority of revenues in this region 
advertising revenues were up million or in this region  and circulation revenues were down nominally 
most of the sales of news operations affected this region 
management estimates that excluding properties sold in and  and giving effect for the change in period reporting  revenues from the carolinas newspapers would have increased in the range in northwest the northwest newspapers reported the strongest revenue growth percentage of all regions in  although it is the company s smallest region at of total revenues 
revenues from the anchorage and washington state newspapers increased million or 
advertising revenues increased million or  circulation revenues declined  or and other revenues  primarily commercial printing  increased million or nearly 
management estimates that revenues adjusted for the change in period reporting would have grown between to 
non newspaper non newspaper revenues of total revenues were primarily derived from the newspaper network tnn  nando media  the mcclatchy printing company and benson printing company 
both printing companies were sold in late revenues from ongoing operations were million in  up from primarily due to higher revenues at tnn 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased and include star tribune s expenses from march through december  excluding star tribune in and expenses from operations sold in and  expenses from the company s ongoing businesses increased 
compensation increased  newsprint and supplement expenses increased due mostly to higher newsprint prices and all other operating expenses  including depreciation and amortization  increased less than 
management estimates that  had it not changed to period reporting  operating expenses would have risen between to  mostly reflecting general inflation 
non operating expense income net the company s net interest expense increased to million from million in  reflecting service on the debt incurred to complete the star tribune transaction 
its share of the ponderay newsprint company ponderay income see note to the consolidated financial statements was million versus a loss of  in when newsprint prices were lower 
the non operating expense income net includes gains on the sales of certain investments and amortization of unearned covenant revenue from the star tribune totaling million  while the results include pre tax gains of million on the sale of business operations and real estate holdings 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is in  up from a rate in due primarily to the non deductible expenses associated with the star tribune transaction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
compared to net income was million or per diluted share in compared to million or per diluted share in both restated for the change in inventory accounting 
net income from ongoing operations excluding the gains on the sales of community newspapers  other businesses and non strategic assets in and was million or per share in versus million or per share in much of the increase in earnings reflect higher revenues at the company s newspapers in the carolinas  the sacramento bee and the modesto bee  and lower average newsprint prices in than net income also benefited from lower interest expense as the company repaid debt 
revenues increased million to million  up in  but were up million excluding the sold community newspapers from the comparisons 
at ongoing operations  advertising revenues increased mostly reflecting rate increases 
circulation revenues were up nominally as only one of the company s newspapers implemented a home delivery rate increase in operating revenues in thousands change california newspapers   carolinas newspapers   northwest newspapers   non newspaper operations   california the california newspapers generated of total revenues in and increased million over revenues were up million or excluding the four community newspapers sold in february the three bee newspapers  located in sacramento  fresno and modesto  california are the company s primary businesses in this region and recorded million in higher advertising revenues 
circulation revenues declined nominally in  while revenues from non traditional sources  ie niche products  on line services  etc  increased million primarily at the sacramento bee 
carolinas the carolina newspapers generated of total revenues in and increased million  with million from the north carolina newspapers primarily the news observer in raleigh  and the remainder from the company s three south carolina dailies 
advertising revenues increased million in while circulation revenues were up  northwest the northwest newspapers generated of total revenues and reported a  increase in revenues 
revenues were up million or excluding the ellensburg daily record which was sold in december retailer consolidation in the two washington markets  tacoma and tri cities  and lower commercial printing revenues at the anchorage daily news slowed the growth in revenues in this region 
advertising revenues increased million excluding ellensburg while circulation revenues declined  at the ongoing operations 
non newspaper revenues at the company s non newspaper operations declined million 
these operations which account for of total company revenues included the newspaper network  n o s new media division primarily nando media  the company s on line publishing company  mcclatchy printing company  benson printing company  and legi tech 
revenues declined due mostly to the sale of nando media s internet access business and a reorganization at mcclatchy printing company 
operating expenses operating expenses were down in however  excluding the operating expenses of the sold community newspapers  expenses were down 
at the company s ongoing operations  newsprint and supplement cost declined due primarily to lower average newsprint prices 
excluding newsprint and supplement cost and expenses of the sold newspapers  total other operating expenses were up reflecting increased costs associated with new product development and promotions in other expense increases were tempered by the low rate of inflation in non operating expenses income net interest expense declined million as the company paid down debt 
ponderay reported a loss in due to lower newsprint prices 
hence  the company recorded a loss of  in versus income of million in as its share of ponderay s results 
a pre tax gain of million was realized on the sale of four community newspapers in versus a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the ellensburg daily record in also  a pre tax gain of million was recorded on the sale of legi tech and other non strategic real estate assets 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in versus in the tax rate was lower primarily because of a difference in the book and tax basis of intangibles at some of the sold operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at december   versus million at the end of see notes and to the consolidated financial statements and below for a discussion of the impact of the acquisition of the star tribune on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities in and has generated an aggregate of million over the last three years 
during  the company received million in proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets  and billion in proceeds from long term debt discussed below 
the major uses of cash over the three year period have been to consummate the star tribune acquisition billion  to purchase property  plant and equipment see below  and to repay debt 
cash has also been used to pay dividends 
in  the company repaid million of bank debt and paid million in dividends 
proceeds from issuing class a stock under employee stock plans totaled million in see the company s statement of cash flows on page the company expended a total of million in for capital projects and equipment to improve productivity and keep pace with growth and new technology 
capital expenditures over the last three years have totaled million and planned expenditures in are estimated to be approximately million at existing operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s commitments to ponderay 
a syndicate of banks and financial institutions have provided the debt financing of the cowles merger under a new bank credit agreement credit agreement 
the credit agreement consists of the following a term loan consisting of tranche a of million bore interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points  and is payable in seven years  and tranche b of million bore interest at libor plus basis points and is payable in nine and one half years 
a revolving credit line of up to million bore interest at libor plus basis points and is payable in seven years 
as the company reduces the outstanding debt relative to cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  the interest rate spread over libor will decline see below 
the debt is secured by certain assets of the company  and all of the debt is pre payable without penalty 
the company intends to accelerate payments on this debt as cash generation allows 
beginning in  the interest rate spread over libor declined to basis points for tranche a and the revolving credit line  and declined to basis points for tranche b 
the definitive terms of the credit agreement include certain operating and financial restrictions  such as limits on the company s ability to incur additional debt  create liens  sell assets  engage in mergers  make investments and pay dividends 
while the company expects that most of its free cash flow generated from operations in and in the foreseeable future will be used to repay debt  management is of the opinion that operating cash flow and its credit facilities as described above are adequate to meet the liquidity needs of the company  including currently planned capital expenditures and other investments 
the company had million of available credit under its current bank credit agreement at december  year compliance the company s year compliance plan includes a definition of year conformity  compliance certification standards  reporting and risk management structures 
the company s target date for completion of all remediation projects is july  at the time of this filing  the company remains on schedule and fully expects to meet this date of completion 
a corporate task force and task forces at each of our newspapers are in place to assess year issues and the necessary changes to the company s many different systems 
a year compliance coordinator has been named to facilitate our progress in meeting our internal deadlines for compliance 
this coordinator reports to the corporate director of information systems and the company s vice president  finance 
for purposes of achieving remediation  a combination of internal effort  upgrades from vendors  external programmers and consultants  replacement systems or  in a few cases  retirement of systems are being used 
to date  the company has completed an inventory and analysis of systems and equipment with date related logic and is currently in the remediation and testing phases 
historical costs incurred in bringing systems to year compliance through december   are estimated to be  at present  we estimate the incremental cost of making required changes will be approximately  in additional costs through capital projects  previously budgeted for business reasons  which  incidentally  include year compliance  total approximately million throughout the company 
the company s daily newspapers generate over of our revenues and profits 
the following describes these newspapers state of readiness for year  the associated risks and the state of our contingency plans newspaper production facilities and processes production systems the company has reviewed its computer and mechanical systems at all production facilities and many such systems have been made year compliant or will be remediated by the company s target date 
the star tribune will upgrade their press control systems in february also  an upgrade on the press control system for one of the four presses at the sacramento bee has been ordered and is expected to be installed during february these upgrades are considered minor and their absence would not prohibit printing of the daily newspaper 
if the company s presses succumb to year problems  it would be difficult in our larger markets to print on a timely basis 
although all of our papers have reciprocal printing agreements with other papers in each area  our largest papers  which contribute the greatest revenues  are too large to be printed in their entirety at another location 
hence  these newspapers could be printed late  with smaller editions and with less circulation 
this risk would have significant negative revenue implications for the company 
also  there are no assurances that the other newspapers with which the company has reciprocal printing arrangements will be year compliant 
year contingency plans at each property outline procedures for off site printing and special year end press schedules 
third party suppliers one of the most significant risks associated with the company s production systems in the year may be the company s ability to receive electrical power from the various utility companies that serve the communities in which it produces newspapers 
none of the company s newspapers currently have electrical generators sufficiently large enough to run printing presses 
hence  if electrical service is unavailable  the company may have to rely on reciprocal printing agreements discussed above or may not be able to produce a daily newspaper 
the company is continuing to monitor the status of its utility providers as to their year readiness  but must rely on representations from such vendors 
if the company s utility providers are unable to supply electrical power  it could have significant negative revenue implications for the company 
current reports from power utility companies have been promising and have led to an increased level of confidence that significant power failures are unlikely 
nonetheless  company contingency plans and procedures are in place for short term outages 
the company has contacted its newsprint vendors  and we have received written statements that the company s major newsprint suppliers generally expect to be year compliant before january  in addition  we plan to determine in the first half of whether we will increase our stock of newsprint during the last months of  as additional insurance against potential year problems that might be experienced by vendors or delivery systems 
the same inquiry process and determinations are being made for all other major material sources  such as ink and plate suppliers 
editorial systems the company uses editorial systems from various vendors 
we maintain software and hardware maintenance contracts with vendors of critical components  and many systems at our newspapers have been made year compliant 
our largest newspaper  the star tribune completed upgrades to their editorial system in september minor upgrades at a few other newspapers are expected to bring all editorial systems into compliance by july  the company has budgeted to replace existing editorial systems at our california dailies the sacramento bee  the modesto bee and the fresno bee in with newer systems which offer increased functionality  including the ability to paginate pages electronically assemble all elements on a page 
these systems are expected to be year compliant 
the sacramento bee has performed  and the fresno bee and the modesto bee will perform  interim software and or hardware upgrades on the existing editorial systems to meet our year compliance standards 
although the hardware vendor has declined to certify certain pieces of hardware as yk compliant  extensive testing by the application vendor and the sacramento bee indicates that the existing systems can operate into without problems should installation of the new systems extend beyond december  replacement of the editorial systems was already planned and budgeted  therefore  they are not directly a year compliance expense 
costs to upgrade existing software will be expensed as incurred 
for the reasons noted above  we believe at this time that the risks of editorial system failure are minimal 
for backup purposes  our newspapers possess enough apple macintosh workstations generally immune to year issues with input  processing and output capabilities that  in an emergency  could be used to complete an edition  or even produce new editions for several days  while problems were being resolved 
in the case of several newspapers  the primary editorial system functions are currently produced on macintosh workstations  further reducing risk 
in all cases  complications could result in smaller newspapers with less editorial content 
circulation systems it is expected that all circulation systems will be upgraded and be year compliant by mid the majority of these systems are supported by vendor maintenance agreements and in some cases  we rely on the vendor to provide timely releases of compliant versions 
two newspapers  the star tribune and the modesto bee  utilize custom  in house circulation systems that require internal re coding 
several components of the circulation system requiring re coding at the star tribune were completed and moved into production in november the remaining portion of the remediated code will be put into production by the end of march the modesto bee remains on target to achieve compliance on their circulation system by july  in the event that a circulation system should fail  company contingency plans provide for backup delivery lists to be created immediately prior to the end of post press packaging and distribution systems and mechanical equipment are believed to be either already in compliance or are in the process of being replaced as part of regular cyclical system replacements 
we expect all to be year compliant by mid we currently believe our newspapers delivery transportation fleets to be immune from year issues 
the inability to deliver our print products would have negative impact on both circulation and advertising revenues  the primary sources of revenue for the company 
advertising systems customers display systems the company s newspapers use various systems to produce graphics for run of press display advertising 
while we believe most newspapers advertising systems are compliant  three of our newspapers  the star tribune  anchorage daily news and the news observer  rely on graphic processing subsystems from a vendor which has not yet provided year readiness solutions 
progress on these highly customized systems was made during the fourth quarter of  although full compliance has not been achieved 
these three newspapers may be required to replace the systems if they do not achieve year compliance  and detailed contingency plans are being developed 
classified systems the classified advertising systems at the company s newspapers are under software and hardware maintenance contracts with vendors  and in most cases  have received or expect to receive upgrades that the company believes will provide year compatibility 
two newspapers  however  will be replacing their classified systems with newer  more functional models 
the news observer installed a new  year compliant  classified system during the fourth quarter of the anchorage daily news applied a year upgrade to its existing classified system  and we currently believe the system is year compliant  nonetheless  a replacement system is in the process of being installed and is expected to be completed by march general if advertising systems at our newspapers are not brought into compliance  our newspapers may have to retrieve hard copy proofs of advertising contents of the respective databases in advance and manually input graphics  which could delay the production of the newspaper 
moreover  many advertisers currently send advertising materials to the company s newspapers electronically 
if advertisers are unable to create advertising material due to their own year issues  or external communication systems are affected  it is possible that the newspapers would have additional advertising makeup costs 
the company is currently reviewing a plan to address the issue of year readiness with our major advertisers  as they represent a critical source of revenue 
lack of year compliance among major advertisers could result in lost advertising revenues 
accounting  administration and general in  the company  in the course of reviewing the effectiveness of its financial and human resource systems  determined to replace the systems at all newspapers with a centralized system that we believe to be year compliant 
all but two of our newspapers have now switched to the new financial system  and half of our newspapers have moved to the new payroll and human resources system 
by february  the financial systems and by july the human resource systems at all newspapers within the company are expected to operate on this centralized platform 
we believe financial reporting and accounting responsibilities can be met without the use of automated financial systems 
a failure in the company s financial systems would result in delays in processing payables  receivables  payroll and reporting company performance while manual contingency processes were activated 
if the automated advertising or circulation management and billing systems fail see previous discussions of advertising and circulation systems  contingency plans will be implemented that would revert to a manual accounting system 
billing would also be manual  labor intensive and would experience significant delays 
advertising orders would be created using hard copy advertising tickets 
a local database or spreadsheet would be used to create run lists for pagination 
the mcclatchy year compliance plan addressed the need to verify the year readiness of any third party that could cause a material impact on the company 
each mcclatchy property identified and requested year compliance statements from material vendors and suppliers  content providers  utility companies  financial organizations and other business partners 
where written representations of year compliance have not been forthcoming  we assume that the service or product will not be year compliant 
in the event that any of the company s material vendors  suppliers or financial institutions are unable to provide the company with services  materials or financing required to operate the company s business  it could have a material impact on our operations 
to date  no such impact has been identified 
contingency plans in addition to contingency plans noted in the various systems above  each of our newspapers has developed contingency plans to cope with the possibility that major systems could develop problems 
these plans are being reviewed and modified locally and at our corporate office throughout the first half of as testing of major systems indicate need for further refinement 
as an added measure  the company will conduct  at all locations  start to finish functional tests of its production systems in mid and other significant systems in the fall of risk factors we have made forward looking statements in this document that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include the information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of mcclatchy 
forward looking statements are generally preceded by  followed by or are a part of sentences that include the words believes  expects  anticipates or similar expressions 
for those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of you should understand that the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document and in the documents which we incorporate by reference  could affect the future results of mcclatchy  and could cause those future results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements general economic  market or business conditions  financial  reliance on customer and vendor assurances as to their year compliance  the completeness of the company s internal efforts to identify systems that are not year compliant and its remediation efforts associated with such systems  increases in newsprint prices and or printing and distribution costs over anticipated levels  increases in interest rates  competition from other forms of media in our principal markets  increased consolidation among major retailers in our newspaper markets or other events depressing the level of advertising  an economic downturn in the economies of minnesota  california s central valley  the carolinas  washington state and alaska  changes in our ability to negotiate and obtain favorable terms under collective bargaining arrangements with our employees  competitive actions by other companies  other occurrences leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from both display and classified advertising  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments we anticipate will be realized or that these results or developments will have the expected consequences 
substantial leverage  negative net tangible assets  liquidity 
on march   we completed a reorganization the reorganization pursuant to which we implemented a holding company structure and also acquired the star tribune by way of a merger with cowles media company the cowles merger 
to finance the reorganization  we borrowed enough cash to fund payment of the cash due to cowles stockholders  pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the reorganization and refinance debt assumed from cowles and pre existing debt of mcclatchy 
as of december   we had billion of long term debt 
in contrast  our pre reorganization consolidated indebtedness was million 
furthermore  because billion of the purchase price of the cowles merger was allocated to intangible assets  such as goodwill  we now have negative net tangible assets 
our net tangible assets as of december   were million 
this high leverage may have important consequences for us in the future  including the following a our ability to obtain additional financing for future acquisitions if any  working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes may be impaired or  if we are able to obtain additional financing  it may not be on favorable terms  b a substantial portion of our cash flow available from operations  after satisfying certain liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business  will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on this indebtedness  thereby reducing funds that would otherwise be available to us  c a substantial decrease in our net operating cash flows or a substantial increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements  or could force us to modify our operations  and d our leverage may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally 
in addition  the terms of the reorganization borrowing agreements include operating and financial restrictions  such as limits on our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens  sell assets  engage in mergers or consolidations  make investments and pay dividends 
the reorganization debt is secured by certain assets of mcclatchy 
all of the reorganization debt is pre payable without penalty 
although we have no present plan in place for early repayment of this debt  we intend to accelerate payments on this debt as cash generation allows 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
our principal uses of liquidity will be to provide working capital  to meet debt service requirements and other liabilities arising in the ordinary course and to finance our strategic plans 
a revolving credit facility is available for our working capital needs 
a term loan facility has been drawn in full 
earnings dilution as a result of the cowles merger 
our net income and earning per share for the next several years will be reduced due to increased interest expense as a result of the incurrence of additional long term debt in the cowles merger  the amortization of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill associated with the cowles merger  and the issuance of shares of our class a common stock in the cowles merger 
assuming that the cowles merger had occurred on january   our pro forma income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended december  would have been approximately million  as compared to million of income from continuing operations for mcclatchy newspapers  inc for the same period on a historical basis restated for a change in inventory accounting see note to the consolidated financial statements 
similarly  our pro forma interest expense for fiscal would have been approximately million  as compared to approximately million for mcclatchy newspapers  inc for the same period on a historical basis 
assuming that the cowles merger had occurred on january   our pro forma income from continuing operations for the year ended december   would have been approximately million as compared to million of income from continuing operations for the mcclatchy company for the same period on a historical basis 
similarly  pro forma interest expense for would have been approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the mcclatchy company for the same period on a historical basis 
there can be no assurance that this reduction in earnings per share and net income from continuing operations will not have a negative impact on the market price of our class a common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to normal business risks discussed above  the company utilizes interest rate protection agreements to help maintain the overall interest rate parameters set by management 
none of these agreements were entered into for trading purposes 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of this interest rate mix  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would have a to per share increase or decrease in the company s results of operations 
it would also impact the fair values of its market risk sensitive financial instruments  but would not materially affect the company s financial position taken as a whole
