to counter this  the right start carefully screened infant and toddler products in order to identify those considered to be the best of the best  that is  the safest  most durable  best designed and best valued items 
the right start then expanded its distribution channel beyond the right start catalog and into specialty retail sales through the right start stores

the number of stores open reflects the rapid growth that the company experienced in and early  during which time mall stores were opened 
after studying the results of both mall and street locations  management concluded that street locations represented a much more appropriate format for future retail growth 
these locations are more convenient to access and shop for the company s customers  many of whom are shopping with infants and small children 
further  street locations are more cost efficient to build and operate 
accordingly  the company adopted a store opening plan which provided for the opening of eight street location stores in in addition to reevaluating store location strategy  in the company determined that certain existing mall locations were not performing at an acceptable level and implemented a store closing plan 
nine mall stores were closed in the right start catalog the right start catalog offers a mail order alternative for the right start customers

this type of operation offers customers an extensive variety of products for children and is typically located in up to  square feet of retail space  generally in lower real estate cost locations 
in addition  many national and regional mass merchants offer infant and toddler products in conjunction with a full line of hard and soft goods 
the right start distinguishes itself from its competition by offering only select  high quality products in each category in a small  service intensive environment 
there are a variety of general and specialty catalogs selling infants and children s items in competition with the right start catalog 
the company considers its primary catalog competition  however  to be one step ahead  kids club by perfectly safe  and sensational beginnings 
these catalogs emerged several years after the right start catalog and directly compete by offering a very similar product line at comparable price points to the same target market

impact of inflation the impact of inflation on results of operations has not been significant during the company s last three fiscal years 
seasonality the company s business is not as significantly impacted by seasonal fluctuations  when compared to many other specialty retail and catalog operations 
the right start s products are for the most part need driven and the customer is often the end user of the product 
however  the company does experience increased sales during the christmas holiday season 
other matters year the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company is currently working to identify and resolve all potential issues relating to the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information system 
for purposes of addressing the issues and planning the appropriate resolutions  the company has segregated its internal systems and individually assessed their state of readiness as follows phase of planning x indicates phase is complete system awareness assessment renovation validation implementation credit card processing x x x x x inventory maintenance x x x x accounting and reporting x x x x point of sale transactions x x non computerized x x systems none are material to the company s operations in addition to resolving any year issues on the company s internal systems  the company is working with its third party vendors in implementing the appropriate solutions 
the company estimates that the maximum  worst case cost of addressing its year issues is approximately  for hardware and software 
the company is currently working with its software vendors for inventory maintenance systems and accounting and reporting systems to complete the installation of the upgraded  year compliant version of these systems 
the company is working with its vendor for its point of sale pos system to complete the program changes required for this system to be year compliant 
if  in a worst case scenario  the necessary upgrades could not be completed in a timely manner  the company s contingency plans provide for the purchase and installation of replacement pos software 
no other systems are material to the company s operations 
new accounting requirements in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities sop which requires that the costs of start up activities and organization costs be expensed as incurred 
the statement is effective for the company in fiscal and the impact of the adoption of sop is not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
effective october  and as disclosed in note  the company began expensing all store pre opening costs as incurred
