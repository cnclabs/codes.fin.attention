company overview we are a leading global provider of security risk management services and products to multi national corporations  governmental agencies and law enforcement personnel through our two operating divisions armor group services and armor holdings products

we believe significant opportunities exist to grow our company and extend our global infrastructure through geographic expansion and strategic acquisitions of related businesses in the fragmented security risk management services and products industry 
acquisitions we have pursued a strategy of growth through acquisition of businesses and assets that complement our existing operations 
we use several criteria to evaluate prospective acquisitions including whether the business to be acquired o broadens the scope of the services or products we offer or the geographic areas we serve  o offers attractive margins  o is accretive to earnings  and o offers the opportunity to enhance profitability by improving the efficiency of our operations

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounts standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
comprehensive income includes net income and several other items that current accounting standards require to be recognized outside of net income 
this standard requires enterprises to display comprehensive income and its components in financial statements  to classify items of comprehensive income by their nature in financial statements  and to display the accumulated balances of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital 
sfas was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this standard for our fiscal year beginning december  inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or profitability 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
year compliance many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead 
if not corrected  those programs could cause date related transaction failures 
we have developed a year initiative to address this concern 
a project team has performed a detailed assessment of all internal computer systems and  as discussed below  is developing and implementing plans to correct problems that may arise as a result of year we expect these projects to be successfully completed during a year status failure could affect many of our research and development  production  financial  administrative and communication operations 
systems critical to our business which have been identified as non year compliant are either being replaced or corrected through programming modifications 
in addition  a separate team is looking at year readiness from other aspects of our business  including customer order taking  manufacturing  raw materials supply and plant process equipment 
our goal is to have the remedied and replaced systems operational by the second quarter of to allow time for testing and verification 
we are in the process of communicating with all of our significant vendors  major customers  suppliers  communications providers and banks whose systems failures potentially could have a significant impact on our operations to determine the extent to which we are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues or to verify their year readiness 
we are testing such systems where appropriate and possible 
as part of the year initiative  we are developing business continuity plans for those areas that are critical to our business 
these business continuity plans will be designed to mitigate serious disruptions to our business flow beyond the end of  and will operate independent of the external providers year compliance 
the major drive for contingency planning will be in the first half of  with the expectation that our business groups will have plans in place by the end of the second quarter of based on our current plans and efforts to date  we do not anticipate that year problems will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have not yet developed any contingency plans in the event our year remediation efforts are unsuccessful  but plan to do so in while we have not identified a reasonably likely worst case scenario in the event we do not become year compliant  we continue to evaluate the year issue and are attempting to address any year deficiencies 
external and internal costs specifically associated with modifying internal use software for year compliance are expensed as incurred 
to date  we have spent  on this project 
costs to be incurred for the remainder of to remedy the year problems are estimated at approximately  these costs do not include normal system upgrades and replacements 
we do not expect the costs relating to our year remediation efforts to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the above expectations are subject to uncertainties 
for example  if we are unsuccessful in identifying or remedying all year problems in critical operations  or if we are affected by the inability of our suppliers or major customers to continue operations due to such a problem  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely effected 
the total costs that we incur in connection with year problems will be influenced by the ability to successfully identify year system flaws  the nature and amount of programming required to fix the affected programs  the related labor and or consulting costs for such remediation  and the ability of third parties with whom we have business relationships to successfully address their own year concerns 
these and other unforeseen factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements we believe that it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
accordingly  this report contains discussion of events or results that have not yet occurred or been realized 
you can identify this type of discussion  which is often termed forward looking statements  by such words and phrases as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and could be 
execution of acquisition strategies  expansion of product lines and increase of distribution networks or product sales are areas  among others  whose future success may be difficult to predict 
you should read forward looking statements carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position  or state other expectations of future performance 
the actions of current and potential new competitors  changes in technology  seasonality  business cycles and new regulatory requirements are factors that impact greatly upon strategies and expectations and are outside our direct control 
there may be events in the future that we are not able accurately to predict or to control 
any cautionary language in this report provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ from the expectations we express in our forward looking statements 
before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that the occurrence of certain of the events described in this report could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its investments in short term investments as the company currently has no short or long term borrowings outstanding 
there is inherent roll over risk for marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
however  there is no risk of loss of principal  only a risk related to potential reduction in future interest income 
derivative instruments are not presently used to adjust the company s interest rate risk profile 
the majority of the company s business is denominated in us dollars 
there are costs related to the london headquarters which are denominated in the british currency 
several other currencies are used by the company for various transactions  but their effect on the total business is minimal 
the company maintains a hedge against the costs paid out in the british currency as there are several customers who pay in to the company in that same currency 
therefore  any sterling payments made are paid out of a sterling bank account thus eliminating any foreign currency exchange gains or losses 
risks associated with international operations the company does business in numerous countries  including emerging markets in africa  asia and south america 
the company has invested substantial resources outside of the united states and plans to continue to do so in the future 
the company s international operations are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions 
governments of many developing countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector 
government actions in the future could have a significant adverse effect on economic conditions in a developing country or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company and its operating companies 
the company does not have political risk insurance in the countries in which it currently conducts business 
moreover  applicable agreements relating to the company s interests in its operating companies are frequently governed by foreign law 
as a result  in the event of a dispute  it may be difficult for the company to enforce its rights 
accordingly  the company may have little or no recourse upon the occurrence of any of these developments
