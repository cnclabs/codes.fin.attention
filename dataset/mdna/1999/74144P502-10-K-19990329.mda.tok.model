item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations we explain our general financial condition and results of operations including results of operations why revenues  costs and earnings changed from the prior period funds from operations ffo how we used cash for capital projects and dividends in through and how we expect to use cash in where we plan on obtaining cash for future dividend payments and future capital expenditures impact of year technology issues on our operations in we changed our fiscal year end from august to december  which is required for reits 
because of this change  the transition period ended december  consisted of only four months 
for that reason  we will compare our discussion of the year ended december  with the equivalent recast twelve month period of financial information for the year ended december  is unaudited and used for this discussion only 
we will also compare the two years ending august  and as you read management s discussion and analysis  it may be helpful to refer to our financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page in management s discussion and analysis we explain the changes in specific line items in the statements of income 
where changes are due to more than one reason  we list the reasons in order of importance 
rental revenues rental percent revenues change change year ended december   year ended december unaudited  year ended august  year ended august  revenues increased million to million in compared to because properties we acquired at the end of and in generated million of revenues in expansion of our self storage business provided an additional million of revenue revenues from properties we owned in both and generated an additional million from new leases generating revenues revenues from properties sold or transferred to pricesmart in the distribution contributed million of revenues in the prior year 
revenues of million were lost from the homeplace bankruptcy  a former tenant at our dallas  tx location revenues increased million to million in the year ended august  compared to because new leases at our dallas  tx location generated an additional million of revenues offset by revenues lost from the bradlees bankruptcy  a former tenant at our seekonk  ma location revenues lost from selling our richmond  ca location expenses percent amount change change year ended december   year ended december unaudited  year ended august   year ended august  expenses decreased million to million in compared to primarily because we wrote off million in for asset impairments on properties held for sale because their book value was higher than what we expected to receive when the properties sold we wrote off costs in related to the pricesmart distribution  consisting of insurance  legal and accounting fees of million which contributed to our decrease in general and administrative expenses in properties we acquired at the end of and in increased expenses million expansion of our self storage business in increased expenses an additional million properties sold or transferred to pricesmart resulted in a decrease in expenses of million expenses decreased million to million in the year ended august  compared to because we wrote off million in for asset impairments on properties held for sale properties sold and leases terminated in accounted for million in expense reductions for we expensed costs in related to the pricesmart distribution  consisting of insurance  legal and accounting fees of million  partially offsetting expense reductions discussed above operating income percent amount change change year ended december   year ended december unaudited  year ended august   year ended august  operating income increased for and the year ended august  compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily because of the changes in rental revenues and expenses discussed above 
interest expense percent amount change change year ended december    year ended december unaudited year ended august year ended august during  interest expense increased million because we recorded million in interest expense related to our unsecured revolving credit facilities we recorded million in interest expense related to the note payable associated with our san diego murphy canyon  ca self storage facility purchase we capitalized million of this million interest incurred to real estate assets interest expense decreased million to million in the year ended august  compared to because we repaid a million note payable to costco during the last quarter of the year ended august  less construction activity in reduced capitalized interest over the prior year interest income percent amount change change year ended december  year ended december unaudited  year ended august  year ended august  interest income decreased million to million in compared to primarily because we received full payment for a million interest bearing note receivable in we transferred previously invested cash and other interest bearing notes receivable to pricesmart in august we used previously invested cash for acquiring and developing properties interest income increased million to million in the year ended august  compared to because we earned more interest income on invested cash balances 
gain loss on sale of real estate and investments net percent amount change change year ended december year ended december unaudited year ended august   year ended august during we sold a free standing restaurant building at our azusa  ca property and recorded a  gain 
we also sold a free standing carwash at our northridge  ca site and recognized no gain or loss 
we consider these two parcels incidental to our main business 
the loss recorded in the year ended december  relates to the properties and investments sold prior to the pricesmart distribution 
the gain on sale of properties for the year ended august  related to the sale of properties in schaumburg  il  gaithersburg  md  colton  ca  and concord  ca 
these gains were partially offset by losses on the sale of properties in houston  tx and washington metro  md 
we recorded a  gain during the year ended august  related to the sale of a preferred stock investment in a privately held specialty retailer and on the sale of options to purchase stock in a privately held automobile broker 
provision for income taxes percent effective amount change change tax rate year ended december n a year ended december unaudited n a year ended august   year ended august  we have no income tax expense for because of our reit status 
before we became a reit in september we recorded income taxes at an effective tax rate of 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in the year ended december  that offset the tax expense recorded 
the tax benefit related to a previously recorded income tax liability that was presumed no longer payable because of our conversion to a reit as well as income tax refunds receivable related to federal tax net operating loss carrybacks 
discontinued operations percent amount change change year ended december  year ended december  year ended august   year ended august  due to the pricesmart distribution in august  there were no discontinued operations in the decrease in the net loss from operations of the discontinued merchandising segment for the year ended august  compared to the year ended august   was primarily a result of decreased expenses upon the expiration of certain contractual obligations to pay costco million per year for marketing related activities  as well as increases in sales and gross margin due to the opening of the panama city location in october and increases in sales of us sourced products to licensees 
the discontinued merchandising segment was transferred to pricesmart in the distribution 
funds from operations year ended december year ended august income before provision for income taxes     depreciation and amortization     provision for asset impairments    gain loss on sale of real estate and investments  net  other funds from operations     straight line rents     adjusted funds from operations     weighted average shares outstanding     real estate industry analysts generally consider funds from operations ffo as another measurement of performance for real estate oriented companies 
in general  ffo adjusts net income for noncash charges such as depreciation  amortization and most non recurring gains and losses 
the national association for real estate investment trusts nareit  defines ffo as net income  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  and gains losses from certain sales of property 
we also exclude provisions for asset impairments and gains losses from sale of investments when we calculate ffo 
we also adjust the nareit definition to eliminate straight line rents in adjusted ffo because of their significance in our operations 
straight line rent accruals are noncash revenues associated with fixed future minimum rent increases 
ffo during increased to million compared to because properties acquired at the end of and in generated million we reduced general and administrative expenses million primarily related to the pricesmart distribution expansion of our self storage business in generated million the change in net interest of million from million net interest income in to net interest expense in offset the increases in net operating income generated from our properties ffo for  excluding income earned from assets transferred to pricesmart  increased to million in from million in ffo and adjusted ffo do not represent the generally accepted accounting principles definition of cash flows from operations and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
for the years ended august  and  the growth in adjusted ffo reflects many of the factors mentioned in the rental revenues  expenses and operating income discussed previously in this section of item liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our business operations 
capital resources represent those funds used or available to be used to support our business operations and consist of stockholders equity and debt 
cash flow from operations has been the principal source of capital to fund our ongoing operations and dividend payments  while use of our credit facilities and mortgage financing have been the principal sources of capital required to fund our growth 
while we are positioned to finance our business activities through a variety of sources  we expect to satisfy short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and through borrowings 
through we anticipate investing approximately up to million for commercial real estate development on property we own a portion of this amount represents commitments under executed construction contracts up to million for development and expansion of our self storage business up to million for real estate acquisitions and development opportunities we cannot guarantee that these estimates will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
business conditions and other risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from these estimates  particularly our plan to acquire real estate which is primarily dependent on the continued attractiveness of real estate values and the available cost of capital for the company 
we are currently in various stages of negotiations to purchase additional commercial properties and continuing to evaluate various other properties for acquisition or development 
to the extent that investment opportunities exceed available cash flow from the sources mentioned above  we may raise additional capital through bank credit facilities and or secured mortgage financing 
we also may choose to seek additional funds through future public offerings of debt or equity securities 
from time to time we will consider selling properties to better align our portfolio with our geographic and tenant composition strategies 
we are in the process of selling two properties from our portfolio for approximately million 
we are also contemplating selling certain other properties 
these sales may not be completed due to uncertainties associated with contract negotiations and buyer due diligence contingencies 
in december we obtained a million unsecured credit facility from wells fargo bank  amsouth bank and bank one 
this facility has a three year term with an initial interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the rate may vary based on our leverage and other financial ratios 
at december   there was million outstanding on the wells fargo facility at a interest rate 
in september we announced our intention to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock for per share 
to fund this purchase  we obtained a million credit facility with morgan guaranty trust company the morgan facility 
the morgan facility has a one year term with an interest rate of libor plus basis points 
sol price a significant stockholder of our company and the father of robert price  our chairman of the board  helen price sol price s spouse and the sol helen price trust entered into a guaranty and pledge agreement the guaranty in which they agreed to guaranty our obligations under the morgan facility 
the sol and helen price trust also granted morgan guaranty trust company a continuing security interest in us treasury notes worth more than the amount outstanding under the morgan facility to secure their obligations under the guaranty 
at year end  million was outstanding under the morgan facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
in conjunction with the san diego murphy canyon  ca self storage facility purchase  we assumed an existing million note secured by the property 
the note  payable to a financial institution  matures in july and bears an interest rate of 
the note does not permit repayment prior to july in august we distributed to stockholders of record one share of newly created series a preferred stock  par value  for each share of common stock held by them on the record date 
we raised no capital through this transaction 
the series a preferred stock pays quarterly dividends totaling per year with a per share liquidation preference 
prior to the distribution of series a preferred stock  we paid dividends on our common stock 
dividends of will be paid on the series a preferred stock and any dividends paid in excess of  will be paid to our common stockholders 
we have the right to redeem the series a preferred stock after august  or after a change of control of our company at a redemption price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends  if any 
year many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead 
if not corrected  those programs could cause date related transaction failures 
we recognize the significance of ensuring our operations and systems are not adversely impacted by year problems 
we are in the final phases of upgrading our existing computer software and information technology 
the project cost is approximately  and we expect to be substantially finished by june   which is prior to any anticipated impact on our operating systems 
we believe that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for our computer systems 
in connection with our operating properties  we are evaluating all systems that contain embedded chips such as security systems  elevators  lighting and hvac systems 
we will continue to commit the resources necessary for the management and elimination of critical year risks 
we expect to complete our evaluation and make necessary changes by june  although it is not possible to quantify the total cost of all corrections at this time  we do not expect that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
we expect all critical internal year issues will be resolved prior to the year we are also currently evaluating the year readiness of third parties such as utilities  financial institutions  governmental agencies  municipalities and tenants  and the impact  if any  on our company and the operations of our properties 
however  we cannot quantify or ensure that these external systems  whether certified to be year compliant or not  would not create difficulties for us before  on  or after the year we intend to develop a contingency plan to handle most likely and worst case year scenarios 
we intend to complete our determination of a worst case scenario after receiving and analyzing responses to substantially all inquiries we made to third parties 
following our analysis  we intend to develop a timetable for completing our contingency plans and expect to complete our contingency plan by june  inflation because a substantial number of our leases contain provisions for rent increases based on changes in various consumer price indices  based on fixed rate increases  or based on percentage rent if tenant sales exceed certain base amounts  we do not expect inflation to have a material impact on future net income or cash flow from developed and operating properties 
in addition  substantially all leases are triple net  which means specific operating expenses and property taxes are passed through to the tenant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
we do not have any foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
we did not have any derivative financial instruments at december  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our unsecured lines of credit 
we enter into variable rate debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we continuously evaluate our level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 
we had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  based upon these year end debt levels  a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to us at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
