item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the statements contained in this form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the factors set forth above under item under the heading business risks 
overview due to market conditions  ie  high prepayments  fueled by declining interest rates and the need to lower leverage  the majority of the company s mortgage securities were sold during the fourth quarter 
in order to increase liquidity  the company divested itself of all but million in mortgage securities in the fourth quarter of the sale of the majority of the company s mortgage security portfolio caused a loss of approximately million 
during  the company s income consisted of interest income generated from its mortgage assets and its cash balances collectively  earning assets 
during  income was also generated by equity in american residential holdings  inc  prepayment penalty income and management fee income 
the company funds its acquisitions of earning assets with both its equity capital and with borrowings 
for that portion of the company s earning assets funded with equity capital equity funded lending  net interest income is derived from the average yield on earning assets 
due to the adjustable rate nature of the majority of its earning assets  the company expects that income from this source will tend to increase as interest rates rise and will tend to decrease as interest rates fall 
for that portion of the company s earning assets funded with borrowings spread lending  resulting net interest income is a function of the volume of spread lending and the difference between the company s average yield on earning assets and the cost of borrowed funds and interest rate hedging agreements caps and floors 
income from spread lending may initially decrease following an increase in interest rates and then  after a lag period  be restored to its former level as earning assets yields adjust to market conditions 
income from spread lending may likewise increase following a fall in interest rates  but then decrease as earning asset yields adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
the company may seek to generate growth in net income in a variety of ways  including through i improving productivity by increasing the size of the earning assets at a rate faster than operating expenses increase  ii changing the mix of mortgage asset types among the earning assets in an effort to improve returns  and iii issuing new common stock and increasing the size of the earning assets when opportunities in the mortgage market are likely to allow growth in net income per share of common stock  iv increasing the efficiency with which the company uses its equity capital over time by increasing the company s use of debt when prudent and by issuing subordinated debt  preferred stock or other forms of debt and equity 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s efforts will be successful or that the company will increase or maintain its income level

year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer systems  software  and devices with embedded technology that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in systems failures  miscalculations or disruptions in operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is currently in the process of assessing how it may be impacted by the year issue and formulating and implementing a comprehensive plan to address all known aspects of the issue 
based on the company s recent assessment of its internal computer systems including related hardware  software  customized applications and network systems with respect to the year issue  the company determined that its existing network and operating systems are year compliant  with minor issues 
the company has hired an external systems consultant to rectify these minor issues 
the company believes that these measures  the actual and estimated costs of which have been and are expected to continue to be immaterial in the aggregate  will enable its internal computer systems to be year compliant 
the company is also reviewing the efforts of its significant hardware  software  and service providers to become year compliant 
the company has contacted all critical entities with which the company does business to assess their year readiness 
as of december  a majority of these entities have responded to the company s inquiries 
the company is in the process of reviewing the written responses to the inquiries  and is assessing the impact that the year readiness status of such entities may have on the company s operations  and is taking whatever action is deemed necessary 
based on the responses received to date  there has been no indication that the respondents have any material concerns related to their ability to address all of their known significant year issues on a timely basis 
the company anticipates that these review activities will be on going for the remainder of and will include any necessary follow up efforts 
the company  however  cannot presently estimate the total cost of this phase of its year readiness program 
although the review of such entities is continuing  the company is not aware of any third party circumstances with respect to the year issue that may have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company can provide no assurance that the year compliance plans of such third parties will be successfully completed in a timely manner 
based on the results to date of the company s internal assessment and external inquiries  the company does not believe that the year issue will pose significant operational problems for the company or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its results of operation or financial position 
although management believes it has undertaken a careful and thorough analysis  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing efforts are not completed in a timely manner with respect to the problems that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or adversely affect the company s relationship with hardware  software  and service providers 
further  management believes it has undertaken a careful survey of third party entities and does not believe there to be material concern based upon the potential third party risks that have been identified  however  there can be no assurance that the year issues of the other entities will not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems or results of operations 
as of december   a contingency plan has not yet been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario resulting from the year issues as such scenario has not been clearly identified 
the contingency plan will provide timetables to pursue various alternatives  for all external systems classified as critical  based upon the failure of a hardware  software or service provider documentation that there product has been adequately modified  tested  and validated to ensure year compliance 
the company currently plans to complete such contingency planning by june  item a
