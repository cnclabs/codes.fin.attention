general since inception  the company has sought to achieve profitability and revenue growth by providing quality homes in markets which have experienced population and job growth in excess of the national average during the past several years 
newmark has served as the foundation to support the company s growth strategy  including expansion within existing markets  entry into two new markets through start up operations and the acquisition of a regional homebuilder 
the company has experienced significant growth and has positioned itself to continue to expand its residential land and lot acquisitions significantly in markets that it has recently entered  such as charlotte  greensboro winston salem  nashville and dallas fort worth  as well as in houston 
the company believes that  based on its recently acquired lot options in a number of master planned communities in and around houston  there are significant opportunities for achieving greater market share in this market 
the company entered the ft 
lauderdale miami market through its acquisition of the adler companies on march   and then significantly expanded its market share in the south florida market  including palm beach  by acquiring westbrooke on january  the company also achieved synergies in its south florida operation by merging the operations of the adler companies with westbrooke s operations in the company recognizes revenue at the time of closing when title to  and possession of  the property transfers to the buyer 
the company capitalizes in inventory all homebuilding costs during the construction period  including interest and maintenance  and charges those capitalized costs to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
interest incurred on inventory following completion of construction is expensed 
accordingly  as the company s inventory level rises and falls  interest expense can vary significantly 
included in the company s depreciation and amortization expenses is amortization of goodwill in excess of million in each of and related to the company s acquisitions of newmark and adler and approximately million in which also included goodwill related to the westbrooke acquisition 
equity in earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries includes earnings from pacific title  lc pacific title  a title service business in which the company owns a interest  and nhc mortgage group  lp nhc mortgage  a mortgage origination company  in which the company owns a interest  each of which was formed in the company expects these ancillary sources of revenues to grow at a rate consistent with the growth of its core homebuilding business 
additionally  equity in earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries includes earnings from a florida homebuilding partnership  owned by the company  which wound up its home building operations in october currently  all of the company s south florida operations are conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries and are included in the company s revenues rather than in equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries

in  westbrooke accounted for of the revenue and of the homes closed

the increase  excluding westbrooke s contribution  was attributable to the addition of the nashville market as well as increases in the existing markets 
revenues increased in houston  in austin and in dallas 
the average sales price of homes decreased from  in to  in due to the fact that westbrooke s average sales price is less than newmark s 
the average sales price  excluding westbrooke  has increased from  in to  in also  revenues generated from sales of custom homes under fedrick  harris estate homes increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased unit sales in houston  austin and nashville

selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased by to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenues  sg a expense decreased slightly to in  from in excluding westbrooke  sg a expense increased by to million 
this increase was caused by the expansion into nashville  tennessee as well as the growth in the company s texas markets as reflected in the increase in revenues in and the increase in the backlog at the end of december versus december interest expense amounted to million in compared to million in the previous year 
the company follows a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development 
during the year ended december  and  the company expensed a portion of incurred interest and other financing costs on those completed homes held in inventory 
this expense decreased due to the decrease in the average number of completed homes held in inventory for the year ending december  compared to capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time of home closings 
the company s provision for income taxes decreased as a percentage of earnings before taxes to for the year ended december   compared to for under a tax allocation agreement with pacific usa the tax allocation agreement  the company is required to calculate its federal corporate income tax liability as if it filed a separate federal income tax return for each period and to pay pacific usa the sum of which would result from such calculation if the company were subject to federal corporate income tax and filed a separate tax return 
the company recognized federal income tax expense under the tax allocation agreement amounting to million for the year ended december  compared to million for net income increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the corresponding period in westbrooke comprised of the net income for the year ending december  excluding westbrooke  net income increased by to million in from million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by to million in from million in this increase in revenues is largely attributable to two factors 
first  the number of homes closed by the company increased by to units in from units in second  the average sales price increased by from  to  per home sold 
this increase in the average sales price was primarily due to a change in the mix of homes sold 
revenues generated from sales of fedrick  harris estate homes increased from of total revenues in to of total revenues in since the average sales price for fedrick  harris estate homes is approximately higher than the average sales price for homes sold under the newmark brand name  the increase in the percentage of revenues from fedrick  harris estate homes as compared to newmark homes resulted in the increase in the average sales price of homes sold in the period 
home closings increased in the company s dallas forth worth and ft 
lauderdale miami markets  and decreased in houston and austin

as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively stable at for compared to for interest expense  which primarily reflects the carrying cost of completed homes  increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the impact of adverse weather on home sales in the houston market and an increased inventory level in florida associated with increased levels of activity in that market 
the company s provision for income taxes decreased as a percentage of earnings before taxes to in  compared to in under the tax allocation agreement with pacific usa  the company is required to calculate its federal corporate income tax liability as if it filed a separate federal income tax return for each period and to pay pacific usa the sum which would result from such calculation if the company were subject to federal corporate income tax and filed a separate tax return 
the company recognized federal income tax expense under the tax allocation agreement amounting to million in compared to million in seasonality and quarterly results the homebuilding industry is seasonal  as generally there are more sales in the spring and summer months  resulting in more home closings in the fall 
the company operates in the southwestern and southeastern markets of the united states  where weather conditions are more suitable to a year round construction process than other areas 
the company also believes its geographic dispersion to be somewhat counter cyclical  with adverse economic conditions associated with certain of its markets often being offset by more favorable economic conditions in other areas 
the seasonality of school terms has an impact on the company s operations  but it is somewhat mitigated by the fact that many of the company s buyers at the higher end of the company s price range  including fedrick  harris custom homes  no longer have children in school 
as a result of these factors  among others  the company generally experiences more sales in the spring and summer months  and more closings in the summer and fall months 
likewise  westbrooke has experienced seasonality in its revenues  generally completing more sales in the spring and summer months and more closings in the fourth quarter 
the following table presents selected quarterly operating data of the company for each of the eight quarters through the period ended december  in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments have been included to present fairly the unaudited selected quarterly operating data

factors expected to contribute to the variability include  among others i the timing of home closings  ii the company s ability to continue to acquire land and options on acceptable terms  iii the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for the construction of homes  iv the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions  v the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry  vi prevailing interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing  vii pricing policies of the company s competitors  viii the timing of the opening of new residential projects  ix weather  and x the cost and availability of materials and labor 
the company s historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and the company expects its financial results to vary from project to project from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company s financing needs depend primarily upon its sales volume  inventory levels  inventory turnover and land acquisitions 
for the years ended december   and  the company used cash in operations of million  million and million  respectively 
the significant use of cash in operations of the company has primarily been due to the increasing inventory levels maintained by the company as the company continues to expand its business 
historically  the company has financed its operations primarily through its earnings  borrowings from financial institutions  and  prior to the company s initial public offering on march   capital contributions and borrowings from pacific usa  primarily for residential land development acquisitions 
the company has financed in the past  and intends to continue to finance  its operations with cash from operations and borrowings under construction and lot development credit facilities 
generally these credit agreements are with regional and national lenders 
each of the credit agreements relates to specific markets and provides for financing residential land and lot acquisition and construction 
the agreements have restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit speculative home building  debt to tangible net worth ratios  dividends and set a minimum requirement for tangible net worth 
the agreements have various maturity dates and bear interest at rates based on libor and prime 
at december   the company had million of available credit under its existing credit facilities 
the company plans to renew these facilities as they mature 
with the exception of the south florida operation  the company utilizes lot options as a method of controlling its investments in land 
at december   the company had  lots under option 
at december   the company had no material capital commitments with respect to specific performance lot purchase contracts 
in the ft 
lauderdale palm beach miami market  the company is limited in its ability to acquire finished lots under option contracts  a factor which requires the company to make significant capital expenditures in order to maintain adequate lot inventory in this market 
at the date hereof the company had approximately  million outstanding under promissory notes incurred in connection with the acquisition of westbrooke 
the promissory notes are to be repaid in equal annual installments from through the company believes it will have adequate financial resources  including availability under its credit facilities  to meet its working capital and residential land acquisition and development plans under current market conditions 
however  there can be no assurance that the amounts available from such sources will be sufficient 
the company s combined consolidated outstanding debt was approximately million at december  accordingly  the company expects to incur interest charges on a consolidated basis at higher levels than it has in the past 
in addition  if the company identifies significant new acquisition opportunities outside of the company s existing markets  or if the company s operations do not generate sufficient cash from operations at levels currently anticipated  the company may be required to seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources  including additional bank financings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that the amounts available from such sources will be sufficient 
the amount and types of indebtedness which the company may incur are limited by the terms of its existing financing agreements 
in addition  the incurrence of additional debt by the company would increase its debt service and interest obligations  which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
if the company is not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund its planned expansion and other expenditures  new projects may be constrained 
any such delay or abandonment could result in a reduction in sales and may adversely affect the company s future business and results of operations 
inflation the company  as well as the homebuilding industry in general  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
in addition  higher mortgage interest rates may significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers 
the company attempts to pass through to its customers any of its costs through increased sales prices 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s future results of operations 
year readiness disclosure the company has assessed and is continuing to assess its operating systems  computer software applications  computer equipment and other equipment with embedded electronic circuits programs that it currently uses to identify whether they are year compliant and  if not  what steps are needed to bring them into compliance 
the company expects that the majority of all programs  including computer information systems utilized in its homebuilding and residential lot development operations  will be year compliant by the end of the second quarter of calendar for those programs that will not be compliant by then  the company is reviewing the potential impact on the company and the alternatives that are available to it if the programs cannot be brought into compliance by december  the company believes that the required changes to its programs will be made on a timely basis without causing material operational issues or having a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position 
the company believes that  should a reasonably likely worst case year situation occur  the company  because of the basic nature of its systems  many of which can be executed manually  would not likely suffer material loss or disruption in remedying the situation 
the costs incurred and expected to be incurred in the future regarding year compliance have been and are expected to be immaterial to the results of operation and financial position of the company 
costs related to year compliance are expensed as incurred 
the company has been reviewing whether its significant subcontractors  suppliers  financial institutions and other service providers providers are year compliant 
the company is not aware of any providers that do not expect to be compliant  however  the company has no means of ensuring that its providers will be year ready 
the inability of providers to be year ready in a timely fashion could have an adverse impact on the company 
the company plans to respond to any such contingency involving any of its providers by seeking to utilize alternative sources for such goods and services  where practicable 
in addition  widespread disruptions in the national or international economy  including  for example  disruptions affecting financial markets  commercial and investment banks  governmental agencies and utility services  such as heat  lights  power and telephones  could also have an adverse impact on the company 
the likelihood and effects of such disruptions are not determinable at this time 
impact of new accounting standards derivative and hedging activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge  the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of i the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedge risk or ii the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  historically  the company has not entered into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
accordingly  the company does not expect adoption of the new standard on january  to affect its financial statements 
start up activities in june  the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa issued sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop requires all start up and organizational costs to be expensed as incurred 
it also requires all remaining historically capitalized amounts of these costs existing at the date of adoption to be expensed and reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
sop is effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes that the adoption of sop on january  will not have a significant effect on its financial statements 
fasb amendments and clarifications in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of financial accounting standards board no 
sfas and technical corrections 
sfas rescinds sfas and amends sfas no 
sfas also amends other existing authoritative literature to make various technical statements issued for fiscal years ending after february  the company believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on its financial statements
