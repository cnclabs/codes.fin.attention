chemicals selling prices for tio  nl s principal product  were generally increasing during most of and most of nl s tio operations are conducted through kronos while its specialty chemicals operations were conducted through rheox 
as discussed above  in january nl completed the disposition of its specialty chemicals business unit 
years ended december  change in millions net sales kronos rheox operating income kronos rheox kronos operating income margi tio data sales volume thousands of metric tons average price index 
fn 
operating income is stated net of amortization of valhi s purchase accounting adjustments made in conjunction with the acquisitions of its interest in nl  which adjustments result in additional depreciation  depletion and amortization expense beyond amounts separately reported by nl 
such additional non cash expenses reduce chemicals operating income  as reported by valhi  by approximately million annually as compared to amounts separately reported by nl approximately million related to tio and approximately million related to specialty chemicals 
kronos tio sales and operating income increased in compared to due primarily to higher average tio selling prices  partially offset by lower sales volumes 
kronos average tio selling prices in were higher than tio selling prices at the end of were higher than the end of kronos average tio selling prices in the fourth quarter of were higher than the fourth quarter of and even with the third quarter of kronos tio sales volumes of  metric tons in were below the previous record level of primarily reflecting lower volumes in asia and latin america 
kronos operating income in includes income of million related to refunds of german franchise taxes related to prior years  including interest 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales  by volume  were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets including to asian markets 
kronos ti production facilities were operating at near full capacity in  and kronos production volume was a record  metric tons 
kronos operating income increased in compared to due primarily to the net effects of record tio sales and production volumes  income resulting from refunds of german franchise taxes discussed above and lower average tio selling prices 
while kronos average tio selling prices  in billing currency terms  were lower in compared to  selling prices were generally increasing throughout the year  and selling prices at the end of were approximately higher than at the end of and higher than the average for kronos achieved record tio sales volumes in  reflecting continued strong demand  particularly in europe  and kronos sales volumes increased to a record  metric tons compared with the previous record tio sales volume set in kronos operating income in also includes a million gain from the disposal of certain surplus assets 
pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions can significantly impact nl s earnings and operating cash flows 
the average tio selling price index using of in was higher than the index of was lower than the index of 
in comparison  the index was below the price index of and higher than the price index of many factors influence tio pricing levels  including industry capacity  worldwide demand growth and customer inventory levels and purchasing decisions 
industry wide ti capacity exceeded demand in the first half of  kronos believes  due to customer destocking inventories 
kronos reduced its production rates to manage its inventory levels  and its average production capacity utilization was approximately in demand for ti improved in the second half of  and was strong throughout and the first half of before moderating in the second half of nl expects industry demand in will be relatively unchanged from  but the extent to which it remains unchanged is dependent upon  among other things  global economic conditions 
kronos produced near full capacity in and  but kronos is curtailing production in to a level not to exceed its expected sales volume 
nl s outlook for average tio selling prices in is uncertain 
notwithstanding the uncertain outlook for tio prices in  kronos expects its tio operating income and margins in will be lower than due to cost inefficiencies related to nl s lower production levels 
rheox s sales and operating income increased in compared to due to higher sales and production volumes 
rheox s operating results include a million gain related to the reduction of certain us employee pension benefits 
nl has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally germany  belgium  norway and canada 
a significant amount of nl s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in  primarily major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of nl s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
in addition  a portion of nl s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar  and exchange rate fluctuations do not impact the reported amount of such net sales 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies decreased sales by million compared to  and decreased sales by million compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted nl s foreign currency denominated operating expenses  and the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on nl s operating income comparisons has not been significant during the past three years 
component products years ended december  change in millions net sales operating income operating income margin component products sales and operating income increased in both and compared with the respective prior year due primarily to higher volumes in all three major product lines ergonomic computer support systems  precision ball bearing slides and locking systems 
combined net sales of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems in increased million  or  compared to  and locking systems net sales increased million  or 
the higher sales volumes of locking systems resulted primarily from the march and november acquisitions of two lock competitors 
component products operating income in includes a million non cash charge related to the award of certain shares of compx s common stock in connection with the completion of its initial public offering in march excluding such charge  operating income increased in due primarily to the higher sales volumes and slightly lower raw material costs  primarily steel  offset in part by lower margins attributable to sales from the two business units acquired in resulting principally from goodwill amortization 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the march acquisition had occurred on january   compx s net sales in would have been million  and its operating income would have been million million excluding the stock award charge 
the pro forma effect of the november acquisition is not material 
also contributing to higher locking system sales in compared to were slightly higher average selling prices due to certain price increases instituted at the beginning of in  combined sales of precision ball bearing slides and computer support systems increased and locking system sales increased 
operating income margins improved in compared to due in part to the elimination of certain unprofitable or low margin product lines acquired in which product lines negatively impacted operating income margins in and increased sales of higher margin ergonomic computer support systems and precision ball bearing slides 
these improvements were partially offset by higher raw material prices  primarily steel 
about two thirds of component products net sales in were generated by its canadian operations 
about of these canadian produced sales are denominated in us dollars while substantially all of the related costs are incurred in canadian dollars 
consequently  relative changes in the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate affect operating results 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar increased component products operating income in excluding the effect of the stock award charge by compared to  and reduced net sales by approximately 
such exchange rate fluctuations did not have a significant impact on component products operating income in compared to recently  some of compx s customers  principally in the office furniture industry  have publicly announced softening market demand and a slowdown in order volumes for their products beginning in late and continuing into while compx has experienced some softening of demand  primarily in its precision ball bearing slide product line and  to a lesser degree  in its ergonomics product line  such softening of demand has been offset in part by increased demand for its security products 
overall  and primarily as a result of the january acquisition of thomas regout  compx expects its sales and operating income in will be higher compared to equity affiliates tremont corporation 
in june  the company acquired million shares of tremont corporation common stock held by contran and certain of contran s subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
such shares  along with an additional  tremont common shares purchased by valhi through open market transactions during  represent approximately of tremont s outstanding common stock at december  valhi accounts for its interest in tremont by the equity method  and commenced reporting equity in tremont s earnings beginning in the third quarter of the company s equity in tremont s earnings differs from the amount that would be expected by applying the company s ownership percentage to tremont s separately reported earnings because of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made in conjunction with the company s acquisitions of its interest in tremont 
at the company s current ownership interest in tremont  such non cash amortization reduces earnings attributable to tremont as reported by the company by approximately million per year 
tremont accounts for its interests in both nl and timet by the equity method 
for the six months ended december   tremont reported income before extraordinary items of million  comprised principally of equity in earnings of timet million and nl million and an income tax benefit of million on pre tax earnings of million 
tremont s effective income tax rate varies from the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily because of a deferred income tax benefit recognized by tremont in the fourth quarter of upon the complete reversal of its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance with respect to its investment in nl  which deferred tax asset tremont now believes meets the more likely than not recognition criteria 
tremont expects its tax provision in will approximate the us federal statutory tax rate 
nl s operating results are discussed above 
for the six months ended december   timet reported net sales  operating income and income before extraordinary items of million  million and million  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  for the same period in for the fourth quarter of  timet s mill product shipment volumes of  metric tons were lower than both the fourth quarter of volumes of  metric tons and the third quarter of volumes of  tons 
the lower level of shipments reflects reduced demand for both timet s aerospace and industrial products 
timet believes the reduction in demand for aerospace products is attributable in large part to inventory reductions by its major customers and a decline in the number of commercial aircraft forecasted to be produced 
the major reason for the reduction in demand for industrial products is the deterioration in asian economies  including the strength of the us dollar versus the japanese yen 
general and administrative expenses were million higher in the last half of compared to the last half of due primarily to costs incurred in implementing timet s new enterprise wide sap information system as well as costs incurred to address the year issue discussed below 
timet also recorded an million pre tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of related to timet s decision to close certain facilities and other cost reduction efforts in response to deteriorating market conditions 
such charge includes a million non cash defined benefit pension plan curtailment charge resulting from united kingdom workforce reductions 
timet estimates that worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products peaked in at approximately  metric tons and decreased in to approximately  metric tons 
timet also estimates industry mill product shipments will further decline in to approximately  metric tons 
timet expects that its production levels  capacity utilization  sales volumes  sales prices  gross profit margins and operating income margins excluding special charges will all be lower in than they were in assuming demand remains at currently expected levels and does not decrease or increase significantly in  timet currently expects to report net losses in at least the first two quarters of  with a return to modest profitability in the third or fourth quarter of in both the aerospace and industrial sectors  reduced demand and lower prices including prices under the long term contracts with major aerospace customers will cause lower sales and gross profit margins 
in addition  expenses related to implementing and maintaining timet s sap information system and to addressing year issues are expected to remain high in in response to the current market conditions  timet began to implement certain operational changes in late to address the weakened demand 
among other things  timet has permanently or temporarily closed certain manufacturing facilities  reduced headcount in the us and europe  renegotiated certain supply contracts with key vendors to reduce volumes and  to some extent  prices  reduced planned capital expenditures for the next two years and merged all of its north american manufacturing operations into one business unit to reduce costs 
timet also has certain long term supply agreements with boeing  wyman gordan  rolls royce and united technologies  timet s major aerospace customers  which are designed to limit price volatility both up and down for the long term benefit of both parties  while providing timet with a solid base of aerospace sales volumes 
valhi periodically evaluates the net carrying value of its long term assets  including its investment in tremont  to determine if there has been any decline in value below their carrying amounts that is other than temporary and would  therefore  require a write down which would be accounted for as a realized loss 
at december   the nyse price of per tremont share indicated an aggregate nyse market value of valhi s investment in tremont common stock of approximately million  or million less than valhi s million net carrying value of its investment in tremont at that date 
the nyse market price was per tremont share as of february  the company believes nyse stock prices particularly in the case of companies such as tremont that have a major shareholder and are not widely followed or traded are not necessarily indicative of a company s enterprise value or the value that could be realized if the company were sold 
after considering what it believes to be all relevant factors including  among other things  the nyse market prices of tremont s holdings of nl and timet  the relatively short time period during which tremont s nyse price has been less than the company s per share net investment in tremont  tremont s and hence nl s and timet s operating results  financial position  estimated asset values and prospects  the company concluded that there had been no other than temporary decline in value of the company s investment in tremont below its net carrying value at december  as discussed above  tremont s major assets are its investments in nl tio and timet titanium metals 
it is possible  should the tio or titanium metals industries in general  or nl or timet specifically  encounter a prolonged recessionary environment  or suffer other unforeseen adverse events  that the value of valhi s investment in tremont could decline to a level which would result in a write down of the company s investment in tremont 
valhi will continue to monitor and evaluate the value of its investment in tremont based on  among other things  the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and business outlook for tremont  timet and nl 
in the event valhi determines that any decline in value of its investment in tremont below its net carrying values has occurred which is other than temporary  valhi would report an appropriate write down at that time 
waste control specialists 
waste control specialists llc  formed in november  was constructing its west texas facility during and waste control specialists reported losses of million in  million in and million in waste control specialists commenced operations in february  and net sales in and were million and million  respectively 
waste control specialists losses were higher in each of and compared to the respective prior year due principally to start up expenses associated with its new facility for the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes  as well as larger expenditures in conjunction with its on going pursuit of permits for the treatment  storage and disposal of low level and mixed radioactive wastes 
valhi is entitled to a cumulative preferential return on its initial million investment in waste control specialists after which earnings are generally split in accordance with the membership interest ratios 
the liabilities assumed by waste control specialists exceeded the carrying value of the assets contributed by the other owner by approximately million 
accordingly  all of waste control specialists income or loss will accrue to valhi until waste control specialists reports positive equity attributable to the other owner 
general corporate and other items gains on disposal of business unit and reduction in interest in compx 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the pre tax gain on disposal of nl s specialty chemicals business unit differs from the amount separately reported by nl due to the write off of a portion of the company s purchase accounting adjustments related to the net assets sold  including an allocated portion of goodwill associated with the company s investment in nl 
general corporate 
general corporate interest and dividend income decreased in compared to  and increased in compared to  due primarily to the dividend distributions received from the amalgamated sugar company llc  which dividend distributions commenced in dividend distributions from the llc are dependent in part upon the llc s results of operations  and the company received million of dividend distributions from the llc in compared to million in based on the llc s current projections  the company currently expects to receive increased levels of dividend distributions from the llc in compared to also contributing to a higher level of general corporate interest and dividend income in compared to was a relatively higher level of funds available for investment  including interest income earned on debt financing valhi provided to snake river sugar company and funds generated from the disposal of discontinued operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
despite the higher level of llc distributions expected to be received in compared to  aggregate general corporate interest and dividend income is expected to be lower in compared to due primarily to a lower level of funds available for investment 
securities transactions in each of the past three years relate principally to the disposition of a portion of the shares of halliburton company common stock and its predecessor dresser industries  inc held by the company when certain holders of the company s lyons debt obligations exercised their right to exchange their lyons for such halliburton shares 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
any additional exchanges in or thereafter would similarly result in additional securities transaction gains 
absent significant additional lyons exchanges in  the company currently expects securities transactions in will be nominal in net general corporate expenses in include an aggregate million pre tax charge related to the settlements of two shareholder derivative lawsuits in which valhi was the defendant  and in include nl s million pre tax charge related to adoption of a new accounting standard regarding environmental remediation liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net general corporate expenses in also include million of nonrecurring costs related to the termination of nl s agreement to acquire certain tio operations and production facilities owned by a competitor 
such charges are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
nl s million of proceeds from the disposal of its specialty chemicals business unit related to its agreement not to compete in the rheological products business will be recognized as a component of general corporate income expense ratably over the five year non compete period  including million recognized in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net general corporate expenses in also include million of expenses related to the amalgamated sugar company llc snake river sugar company transactions 
net general corporate expenses in include a million litigation settlement gain and a million gain on disposition of a surplus grain facility 
because the litigation settlement charge constitutes over one half of the company s aggregate net general corporate expenses in  the company currently expects net general corporate expenses in will be significantly lower than in interest expense 
interest expense decreased in compared to due primarily to a lower average level of outstanding indebtedness primarily valhi s lyons  valcor senior notes and indebtedness related to nl s specialty chemicals business unit which was prepaid in january 
interest expense increased in compared to due primarily to valhi s million in loans from snake river sugar company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense is expected to be lower in compared to due principally to a lower level of indebtedness resulting primarily from nl s october redemption of its senior secured discount notes and scheduled repayments of its dm term loan in at december   approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  principally publicly traded debt and valhi s loans from snake river sugar company  bears interest at fixed interest rates averaging million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of  million at 
the weighted average interest rate on million of outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  was compared to an average interest rate on outstanding variable rate borrowings of at december  and at december  the weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable rate borrowings decreased from december  to december  due primarily to the payoff of certain nl indebtedness rheox bank credit facility and joint venture term loan 
such indebtedness carried a higher interest rate than nl s dm denominated borrowings  which comprised most of the remaining variable rate borrowings at december  and comprise substantially all of the outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  the weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable rate borrowings increased from december  to december  due primarily to nl s january refinancing of certain indebtedness  in which nl refinanced rheox s term loan and used the net cash proceeds  along with other available funds  to prepay a portion of kronos dm credit facility 
the overall interest rate on the rheox term loan was higher than the overall interest rate on the dm credit facility  and the dm libor interest rate margin on outstanding borrowings under the dm credit facility was increased in january nl has significant dm denominated variable interest rate borrowings and  accordingly  nl s interest expense is also subject to currency fluctuations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
periodic cash interest payments are not required on valhi s deferred coupon lyons 
as a result  current cash interest expense payments are lower than accrual basis interest expense 
provision for income taxes 
the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of the company s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the amalgamated sugar company s results of operations in are presented on the equity method 
prior to  amalgamated was a member of the consolidated us tax group of which valhi and contran are members  and consequently the company did not provide any incremental income taxes related to such earnings 
certain subsidiaries  including nl and  beginning in march  compx  are not members of the consolidated us tax group and the company does provide incremental income taxes on such earnings 
both of these factors impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
the provision for income taxes in includes i an million tax benefit resulting from a refund of prior year german dividend withholding taxes received by nl and ii a million benefit resulting from nl s net reduction of its deferred income tax valuation allowance primarily as a result of utilization of certain deductible tax attributes for which the benefit had not been previously recognized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in and  the geographic mix of pre tax income included losses in certain of nl s tax jurisdictions for which no current refund was available and for which recognition of a deferred tax asset was not considered appropriate 
all of these factors also impacted the company s overall effective tax rate 
minority interest  discontinued operations  extraordinary item and equity in earnings of amalgamated 
see notes   and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements 
year issue general 
as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  certain computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
nl 
nl is in the process of evaluating and upgrading its computer systems  both information technology it systems and non it systems involving embedded chip technology  and software applications to ensure that the systems function properly beginning january  to achieve its year compliance plan  nl is utilizing internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its systems 
nl has conducted an inventory of its it systems worldwide and is currently testing the systems and applications that have been corrected or reprogrammed for year compliance 
nl has completed a preliminary inventory of its non it systems and is in the process of validating the inventory and correcting or replacing date deficient systems 
the remediation effort is well under way on all critical it and non it systems  and nl anticipates that remediation and testing of all remaining systems will be complete by september  once systems undergo remediation  they are tested for year compliance 
for critical systems  the testing process usually involves subjecting the remediated system to a simulated change of date from the year to the year using  in many cases  computer resources 
nl uses a number of packaged software products that have been upgraded to a year compliant version in the normal course of business 
excluding the cost of these software upgrades  nl s cost of becoming year compliant is expected to be approximately million  of which about one half has been spent through december  nl has identified approximately  computing systems and is in the process of assessing them for year compliance 
at december   approximately of the systems have been assessed and approximately of the assessed systems are year compliant 
each operating unit has responsibility for its own conversion  in line with overall guidance and oversight provided by a corporate level coordinator  and the status of each of the remaining systems will be specifically tracked and monitored 
as part of its year compliance plan  nl has requested confirmations from its major domestic and foreign software and hardware vendors and primary suppliers that they are developing and implementing plans to become  or that they have become  year compliant 
confirmations received by nl to date indicate that they generally are in the process of becoming year compliant by december  the major software vendors used by nl have already delivered year compliant software 
nl plans to request confirmations from its major customers to ensure they are year compliant or are developing and implementing plans to become year compliant 
notwithstanding these efforts  nl s ability to affect the preparedness of such vendors  suppliers and customers is limited 
nl is developing a contingency plan to deal with potential year issues related to business interruption that may occur on january  or thereafter 
nl s plan is expected to be completed in the second quarter of although nl expects its systems to be year compliant before december   it cannot predict the outcome or success of the year compliance programs of its vendors  suppliers  and customers 
nl also cannot predict whether its major software vendors  who continue to test for year compliance  will find additional problems that would result in unplanned upgrades of their applications after december  as a result of these uncertainties  nl cannot predict the impact on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows resulting from noncompliant year systems that nl directly or indirectly relies upon 
should nl s year compliance plan not be successful or be delayed beyond january  or should one or more suppliers  vendors or customers fail to adequately address their year issues  the consequences to nl could be far reaching and material  including an inability to produce tio at its manufacturing facilities  which could lead to an indeterminate amount of lost revenue 
other potential negative consequences could include manufacturing equipment malfunction  impeded communications or power supplies  or slower transaction processing and financial reporting 
although not anticipated  the most reasonable likely worst case scenario of failure by nl or its key suppliers or customers to become year compliant would be a short term slowdown or cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more of its facilities and a short term inability on the part of nl to process orders and billings in a timely manner  and to deliver product to customers 
compx 
compx has recently installed information systems upgrades for both its us and canadian facilities which contained  among many other features  software compatibility with the year issue 
compx does not currently anticipate spending significant additional funds to address software compatibility with the year issue with respect to its own internal systems 
as part of its year compliance plan  compx is seeking confirmation from its major software and hardware vendors and primary suppliers that they are developing and implementing plans to become  or that they have become  year compliant 
confirmations received by compx to date indicate that they generally are in the process of becoming year compliant by december  the major software vendors used by compx have already delivered year compliant software 
compx plans to seek confirmation from its major customers to ensure they are year compliant or are developing and implementing plans to become year compliant 
notwithstanding these efforts  compx s ability to affect the year preparedness of such vendors  suppliers and customers is limited 
compx is developing a contingency plan to deal with potential year issues related to business interruption that may occur on january  or thereafter 
compx s plan is expected to be completed in the second quarter of although compx expects its systems to be year compliant before december   it cannot predict the outcome or success of the year compliance programs of its vendors  suppliers  and customers 
compx also cannot predict whether its major software vendors  who continue to test for year compliance  will find additional problems that might result in unplanned upgrades of their applications after december  as a result of these uncertainties  compx cannot predict the impact on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows resulting from noncompliant year systems that compx directly or indirectly relies upon 
should compx s year compliance plan not be successful or be delayed beyond january  or should one or more suppliers  vendors or customers fail to adequately address their year issues  the consequences to compx could be far reaching and material  including an inability to produce products at its manufacturing facilities  which could lead to an indeterminate amount of lost revenue 
although not anticipated  the most reasonable likely worst case scenario of failure by compx or its key suppliers or customers to become year compliant would be a short term slowdown or cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more of compx s facilities and a short term inability on the part of compx to process orders and billings in a timely manner  and to deliver product to customers 
thomas regout s year preparedness is substantially similar to compx s other operations 
timet 
most of timet s information systems have been replaced in connection with the implementation of its business enterprise sap system 
the initial implementation of sap has been substantially completed following the rollout of the sap system to the united kingdom in february the cost of the new system  including related equipment and networks  aggregated approximately million during and million capital  million expense with an additional million to million expected to be incurred in timet  with the help of outside specialists and consultants i has substantially completed an initial assessment of potential year issues in its non information systems eg  its manufacturing and communication systems  as well as in those information systems that were not replaced by the new sap system  ii is in the process of determining  prioritizing and implementing remedial actions  including testing  and iii will develop a contingency plan in the event internal or external year issues are not resolved by timet s june  target date for completion 
timet s year readiness varies by location 
some of timet s locations have completed their internal year readiness plans while other locations are in the midst of remediating and testing 
at this time  most sites anticipate completing their year readiness plans by the june target date 
however  remediation of some items at timet s nevada production facility  and possibly other sites  could be delayed beyond the june target date 
timet expended approximately million on these specific year issues in  principally related to embedded system technology  and expects to incur approximately million on such issues in timet s evaluation of potential year exposures related to key suppliers and customers is also in process and will continue throughout notwithstanding these efforts  timet s ability to affect the year preparedness of such suppliers and customers is limited 
although timet believes its key information systems will be year ready before the end of  it cannot yet fully predict the outcome or success of the year readiness programs related to certain of its embedded manufacturing systems or those comparable systems of its suppliers or customers 
timet also cannot predict whether it will find additional problems that would result in unplanned upgrades of applications after june or even december as a result of these uncertainties  timet cannot predict the impact on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or operations resulting from year failures in systems that timet directly or indirectly relies upon 
should timet s year readiness plan not be successful or be delayed beyond december  or should one or more suppliers or customers fail to adequately address their year issues  the consequences to timet could be far reaching and material  including an inability to produce titanium metal products at its manufacturing facilities  which could lead to an indeterminate amount of lost revenue 
other potential negative consequences could include impeded communications or power supplies  slower transaction processing and financial reporting  and potential liability to third parties 
although not anticipated  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of failure by timet of its key suppliers or customers to become year ready would be a short term slowdown or cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more of timet s facilities and a short term inability on the part of timet to process orders and billings in a timely manner  and to deliver products to customers 
waste control specialists 
waste control specialists recently installed information system is year compliant 
the cost of such new information system was not material to waste control specialists 
waste control specialists is in the process of evaluating any potential year issues with respect to embedded chip technology associated with the equipment at its disposal facility  however  because such facility was constructed in the past few years  waste control specialists does not expect such equipment to present any significant year compliance issues 
waste control specialists is also in the process of contacting its major suppliers and customers to confirm they are developing and implementing plans to become  or that they have become  year compliant 
notwithstanding these efforts  waste control specialists ability to affect the year preparedness of such suppliers and customers is limited 
waste control specialists expects to have its evaluation of embedded chip technology and year compliance issues at significant suppliers and customers completed by early in the second quarter of  and any required remedial actions completed prior to the end of assuming waste control specialists does not encounter a significant year compliance issue with respect to the equipment at its disposal facility  waste control specialists does not expect its costs associated with year compliance will be material 
although waste control specialists believes its information systems and equipment at its disposal facility will be year compliant before december   it cannot predict the outcome or success of the year compliance programs at its significant suppliers and customers 
as a result  waste control specialists cannot predict the impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from noncompliant year systems that waste control specialists directly or indirectly relies upon 
should waste control specialists year compliance program not be successful or delayed beyond january  or should one or more suppliers or customers fail to adequately address their year issues  the consequences to waste control specialists could be far reaching and material  including an inability to operate the disposal facility  which could lead to an indeterminate amount of lost revenue 
other potential adverse consequences could include impeded communications or power supplies or slower transaction processing and financial reporting 
tremont 
as a holding company  tremont does not itself have numerous applications or systems 
tremont i has completed an initial assessment of potential year issues in its information systems  ii is in the process of determining  prioritizing and implementing remedial actions  including testing  and iii will develop contingency plans in the event internal or external year issues are not resolved by tremont s june  target date for completion 
the cost for year readiness is not expected to be material to tremont 
although not anticipated  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of failure by tremont or its key service providers to become year ready would be a short term inability on the part of tremont to process banking transactions 
valhi 
as a holding company  valhi does not have numerous applications or systems 
valhi believes its corporate information systems are year compliant 
however  for the reasons discussed above with respect to its subsidiaries and affiliates  valhi cannot predict the impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from noncompliant year systems that valhi  it subsidiaries and affiliates directly or indirectly rely upon 
the consequences to the company could be far reaching and material  including the loss of an indeterminate amount of revenue 
other potential negative consequences could include manufacturing equipment malfunctions  impeded communications or power supplies or slower transaction processing and financial reporting

the dates on which these plans to complete any necessary year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
european monetary conversion beginning january   of the members of the eu  including germany  belgium  the netherlands and france  established fixed conversion exchange rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the european currency unit euro 
such members adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
the remaining four eu members including the united kingdom may convert their sovereign currencies to the euro at a later date 
certain european countries  such as norway  are not members of the eu and their sovereign currencies will remain intact 
each national government retained authority to establish their own tax and fiscal spending policies and public debt levels  although such public debt will be issued in  or re denominated into  the euro 
however  monetary policies  including money supply and official euro interest rates  will now be established by a new european central bank 
following the introduction of the euro  the participating countries national currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro through january   although the exchange rates between the euro and such currencies will remain fixed 
nl 
nl conducts substantial operations in europe  principally in germany  belgium  the netherlands  france and norway 
the national currency in which such operations are located are such operation s functional currency 
the functional currency of the german  belgian  dutch and french operations will convert from their respective sovereign currencies to the euro over a two year period beginning in the euro conversion may impact nl s operations including  among other things  changes in product pricing decisions necessitated by cross border price transparencies 
such changes in product pricing decisions could impact both sales prices and manufacturing costs  and consequently favorably or unfavorably impact nl s reported results of operations 
the pursuit by the participating eu members of a single monetary policy through the european central bank could favorably or unfavorably impact the countries respective economic growth and  accordingly  the regional demand for nl s products 
in  nl assessed and evaluated the impact of the euro conversion on its business and made the necessary system conversions 
nl spent and charged to expense less than million in evaluation and conversion costs associated with the introduction of the euro 
nl has a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in the deutsche mark which  at nl s option  may be repaid in euros 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the ultimate effect of the euro conversion  nl cannot accurately predict the impact of the euro conversion on its results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
compx 
the functional currency of compx s recently acquired thomas regout operations in the netherlands and compx s french lock operations will convert to the euro from their respective national currencies over a two year period beginning in the euro conversion may impact compx s operations including  among other things  changes in product pricing decisions necessitated by cross border price transparencies 
such changes in product pricing decisions could impact both selling prices and purchasing costs and  consequently  favorably or unfavorably impact results of operations 
in  compx assessed and evaluated the impact of the euro conversion on its business and made the necessary system conversions 
modifications of information systems to handle euro denominated transactions have been implemented and were not extensive 
thomas regout s information systems have also been modified to handle euro denominated transactions 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the ultimate effect of the euro conversion  compx cannot accurately predict the impact of the euro conversion on its results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
timet 
timet also has operations and assets located in europe  principally in the united kingdom 
the united kingdom is not adopting the euro 
approximately one half of timet s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the major european currencies 
the us dollar value of timet s foreign sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations that can impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
certain purchases of raw materials for timet s european operations  principally titanium sponge and alloys  are denominated in us dollars while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
costs associated with modification of certain of timet s systems to handle euro denominated transactions have not been significant 
timet does not expect the impact of the conversion to the euro will be material 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating annual activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in the company s earnings 
changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales  purchases and income tax payments 
in addition  cash flows from operating activities in each of the past three years include the impact of the payment of cash income taxes related to the disposal of discontinued operations and the sale of nl s specialty chemicals business unit  even though the pre tax proceeds from the disposal of such assets are reported as a component of cash flows from investing activities 
noncash interest expense consists of amortization of original issue discount on certain valhi and nl indebtedness and amortization of deferred financing costs

in march  compx completed an initial public offering of shares of its common stock for net proceeds to compx of approximately million 
compx used million of such net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its new bank credit facility  of which million was incurred to repay certain intercompany indebtedness owed by compx to valcor and million of which was used to fund the acquisition of a lock competitor 
in january  the company s board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to million shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions over an unspecified period of time 
as of december   the company had purchased approximately  shares for an aggregate of million pursuant to such authorization 
chemicals nl industries pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions can significantly impact nl s earnings and operating cash flows 
in january  nl sold its specialty chemicals business unit conducted by rheox for million cash consideration before fees and expenses  including million attributable to a five year agreement by nl not to compete in the rheological products business 
a majority of the million net of tax proceeds have been used by nl to prepay certain indebtedness 
the remaining net proceeds are available for nl s general corporate purposes  subject to compliance with the terms of the indenture governing its publicly traded debt 
under the terms of such nl indentures  nl was required to make an offer to purchase a pro rata portion of such notes  at par value for the senior secured notes and at accreted value for the senior secured discount notes  to the extent that a specified amount of the net proceeds from the disposal of its specialty chemicals business unit are not used to either permanently paydown certain indebtedness of nl or its subsidiaries or invest in additional productive assets including additional tio production capacity  both as defined in the indentures  within nine months of the disposition 
while nl was not yet required to execute a tender offer related to the disposal of its specialty chemicals business unit  in may nl initiated a tender offer to purchase on a pro rata basis up to million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes and accreted value of senior secured discount notes  at par or accreted value  respectively  in satisfaction of the covenant contained in the indentures 
pursuant to its terms  the tender offer expired in june  and nl purchased approximately million principal amount of senior secured notes  and a nominal amount of senior secured discount notes  which had been properly tendered 
nl also made open market purchases of its senior secured discount notes in  and in october nl redeemed the remaining senior secured discount notes at a price of of their principal amount based upon nl s expectations for the tio industry and anticipated demands on nl s cash resources as discussed herein  nl expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its near term obligations including operations  capital expenditures and debt service 
to the extent that actual developments differ from nl s expectations  nl s liquidity could be adversely affected 
nl s capital expenditures during the past three years  excluding capital expenditures of its disposed specialty chemicals business unit  aggregated million  including million million in for nl s ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs  including german and norwegian off gas desulfurization systems 
nl s estimated capital expenditures are million million and include million million in the area of environmental protection and compliance 
nl spent million in through million in in capital expenditures related to a debottlenecking project at its leverkusen  germany chloride process tio facility that increased nl s worldwide annual attainable tio production capacity to about  metric tons 
the capital expenditures of the tio manufacturing joint venture are not included in nl s capital expenditures 
at december   nl had cash and cash equivalents of million held by non us subsidiaries and had million available for borrowing under non us credit facilities 
the terms of intercompany notes from kii payable to nl mirror the terms of nl s publicly traded debt and are designed to facilitate the flow of funds from nl s subsidiaries to service such indebtedness 
at december   nl had complied with all financial covenants governing its debt agreements 
certain of nl s us and us tax returns are being examined and tax authorities have or may propose tax deficiencies  including non income related items and interest 
nl previously reached an agreement with the german tax authorities and paid certain tax deficiencies of approximately dm million million when paid  including interest  which resolved certain significant tax contingencies for years through in  nl received a dm million million when received refund of previously paid german dividend withholding taxes 
the german tax authorities were required to refund such amounts based on a german supreme court decision in favor of another taxpayer 
nl s refund resulted in a reduction of the previously reached settlement amount referred to above from the dm million to dm million for years through no further withholding tax refunds are expected 
certain other significant german tax contingencies aggregating an estimated dm million million at december  through remain outstanding and are in litigation 
of these  one primary issue represents disputed amounts aggregating dm million million for the years through nl has received tax assessments for a substantial portion of these amounts 
no payments of tax or interest deficiencies related to these assessments are expected until the litigation is resolved 
during  a german tax court proceeding involving a tax issue substantially the same as this issue was decided in favor of the taxpayer 
the german tax authorities appealed the decision to the german supreme court  which in february rendered its judgment in favor of the taxpayer 
nl believes that the german supreme court s judgment should determine the outcome of nl s primary dispute with the german tax authorities 
based on this german supreme court judgment  nl will request that its tax assessments be withdrawn 
nl has granted a dm million million lien on its nordenham  germany tio plant in favor of the city of leverkusen related to this tax contingency  and a dm million lien in favor of the german federal tax authorities for other tax contingencies 
if the german tax authorities withdraw their assessments based on the german supreme court s decision  nl expects to request the release of the dm million lien in favor of the city of leverkusen 
in addition  during nl reached an agreement with the german tax authorities regarding certain other issues not in litigation for the years through  and agreed to pay additional tax deficiencies of dm million million  most of which was paid in during  nl received a tax assessment from the norwegian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  relating to nl has appealed this assessment and has begun litigation proceedings 
during  nl was informed by the norwegian tax authorities that additional tax deficiencies of nok million million will likely be proposed for the year nl intends to vigorously contest this issue and litigate  if necessary 
although nl believes that it will ultimately prevail  nl has granted a lien for the tax assessment on its norwegian ti plant in favor of the norwegian tax authorities and will be required to grant a lien for the assessment when received 
no assurance can be given that these tax matters will be resolved in nl s favor in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court proceedings 
nl believes that it has provided adequate accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
at december   nl had recorded net deferred tax liabilities of million 
nl  which is not a member of the contran tax group  operates in numerous tax jurisdictions  in certain of which it has temporary differences that net to deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 
nl has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at december   principally related to the us and germany  offsetting deferred tax assets which nl believes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition to the chemicals businesses conducted through kronos  nl also has certain liabilities relating to certain discontinued or divested businesses 
see item legal proceedings 
nl has been named as a defendant  potentially responsible party  or both  in a number of legal proceedings associated with environmental matters  including waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
on a quarterly basis  nl evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant 
nl believes it has provided adequate accruals million at december  for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but nl s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs and the allocation of such costs among prps 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites 
the upper end of the range of reasonably possible costs to nl for sites for which it is possible to estimate costs is approximately million 
nl s estimates of such liabilities have not been discounted to present value  and nl has not recognized any potential insurance recoveries 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or the upper end of the range for sites for which estimates have been made and no assurance can be given that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no estimate presently can be made 
nl is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage arising from the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
nl has not accrued any amounts for the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation is without merit 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
in addition  various legislation and administrative regulations have  from time to time  been enacted or proposed that seek to impose various obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead based paint with respect to asserted health concerns associated with the use of such products and to effectively overturn court decisions in which nl and other pigment manufacturers have been successful 
examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share  rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage 
nl currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes  individually or in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurance that additional matters of these types will not arise in the future 
nl periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its capital resources  debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  nl has in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  issue additional securities  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  nl may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the chemicals industry 
in the event of any such transaction  nl may consider using its available cash  issuing its equity securities or refinancing or increasing its indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing nl s existing debt 
in this regard  the indentures governing nl s publicly traded debt contain provisions which limit the ability of nl and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or hold noncontrolling interests in business units 
as discussed in results of operations chemicals  nl has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of nl s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore nl s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
the carrying value of nl s net investment in its german operations is a net liability due principally to its dm bank credit facility  while its net investment in its other non us operations are net assets 
component products compx international in march  compx completed an initial public offering of shares of its common stock 
the net proceeds to compx were approximately million 
million of the net proceeds were used to completely repay the outstanding balance of compx s new million credit facility discussed above 
compx believes that the net proceeds to compx from the offering  after repayment of borrowings under the new credit facility  together with cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the new credit facility will be sufficient to meet compx s liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and future acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
in  compx acquired two lock competitors for aggregate cash consideration of million  primarily using available cash on hand 
in january  compx acquired substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of a precision ball bearing slide competitor for approximately million  using available cash on hand and million of borrowing under its revolving bank credit facility 
compx acquired the remaining ownership interest of the slide competitor by the end of february compx periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  its capital expenditure requirements in light of its capital resources and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  compx may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  compx may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  compx may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of compx or its subsidiaries 
tremont corporation tremont is primarily a holding company which  at december   owned approximately of timet and of nl 
at december   the market value of the million shares of timet and the million shares of nl held by tremont was approximately million and million  respectively 
in february  tremont exercised an option it held and acquired an additional million shares of timet common stock for an aggregate of million  thereby increasing its ownership interest in timet from to 
in october  tremont entered into a revolving advance agreement with contran 
through december   tremont had borrowed million from contran under such facility  primarily to fund tremont s purchases of shares of nl common stock 
in february  tremont borrowed an additional million from contran pursuant to the facility in order to help fund the acquisition of an additional million timet shares discussed above 
tremont periodically evaluates the net carrying value of its long term assets  principally its investments in nl and timet  to determine if there has been any decline in value below their net carrying amounts that is other than temporary and would  therefore  require a write down which would be accounted for as a realized loss 
tremont s per share net carrying amount of its investment in nl at december  was per share  compared to a nyse per share market price of at that date 
at december   the nyse price of per timet share indicated an aggregate nyse market value of tremont s investment in timet of million  or million less than tremont s million net carrying value of its investment in timet at that date 
the nyse market price was per timet share on march  tremont believes nyse stock prices are not necessarily indicative of a company s enterprise value or the value that could be realized if the company were sold 
after considering what tremont believes to be all relevant factors including  among other things  the relatively short period of time that the nyse price has been less than tremont s per share investment in timet  timet s operating results  financial position and prospects  tremont has concluded that there has been no other than temporary decline in the value of its investment in timet below its net carrying value at december  it is possible  however  that should timet or nl encounter a prolonged downturn  or suffer other unforseen adverse events  that the value of tremont s investment in timet  nl or both  could decline to a level which would result in a write down 
tremont will continue to monitor and evaluate the value of its investment in timet and nl based on  among other things  their respective results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and business outlook 
in the event tremont determines any decline in value of its investments below their net carrying value has occurred which is other than temporary  tremont would report an appropriate write down at that time 
in  tremont s board of directors authorized tremont to purchase up to million shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions over an unspecified period of time 
as of december   tremont had acquired million shares under such authorization 
to the extent tremont acquires additional shares of its common stock  the company s ownership interest in tremont would increase as a result of the fewer number of tremont shares outstanding 
based upon certain technical provisions of the investment company act of the act  tremont might arguably be deemed to be an investment company under the act  despite the fact that tremont does not now engage  nor has it engaged or intended to engage  in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading of securities 
tremont has taken the steps necessary to give itself the benefits of a temporary exemption under the act and has sought an order from the securities and exchange commission that tremont is primarily engaged  through timet and nl  in a non investment company business 
tremont believes another exemption may be currently available to it under the act should the commission deny tremont s application for an exemptive order 
tremont periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its alternative uses of capital  its debt service requirements  the cost of debt and equity capital and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  tremont has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests of subsidiaries and affiliates  incur indebtedness  purchase shares of its common stock  consider the sale of interests in subsidiaries  affiliates  marketable securities or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to increase or manage liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  tremont may investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture and other business combination opportunities 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunities  tremont may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or incurring indebtedness 
waste management waste control specialists waste control specialists capital expenditures from its november formation through approximated million 
such capital expenditures  along with its development stage operating losses  were funded primarily from valhi s million of capital contributions million in  million in  million in and million in as well as certain debt financing provided to waste control specialists by valhi

other condensed cash flow data related to discontinued operations medite and sybra and amalgamated is presented in notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements 
general corporate valhi valhi s operations are conducted primarily through subsidiaries and affiliates nl industries  compx  tremont and waste control specialists 
accordingly  valhi s long term ability to meet its parent company level corporate obligations is dependent in large measure on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries 
nl  which paid dividends in the first three quarters of  suspended its dividend in the fourth quarter of suspension of nl s dividend did not materially adversely impact valhi s financial position or liquidity 
starting in the second quarter of  nl resumed regular quarterly dividends at a rate of 
per nl share  and nl increased its quarterly dividend to 
per share in the first quarter of at the 
per share quarterly rate  and based on the million nl shares held by valhi at december   valhi would receive aggregate annual dividends from nl of approximately million 
tremont currently pays a quarterly dividend of 
per share  and valhi began to receive quarterly dividends from tremont in the third quarter of at that rate  and based upon the million tremont shares owned by valhi at december   valhi would receive aggregate annual dividends from tremont of approximately  various credit agreements to which certain subsidiaries or affiliates are parties contain customary limitations on the payment of dividends  typically a percentage of net income or cash flow  however  such restrictions have not significantly impacted valhi s ability to service its parent company level obligations 
valhi has not guaranteed any indebtedness of its subsidiaries or affiliates 
at december   valhi had million of parent level cash and cash equivalents  including 
million held by valcor which could be distributed to valhi  and had million of short term borrowings owed to contran 
in addition  valhi had million of borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility 
valhi s lyons do not require current cash debt service 
at december   valhi held million shares of halliburton common stock  which shares are held in escrow for the benefit of holders of the lyons 
the lyons are exchangeable at any time  at the option of the holder  for the halliburton shares owned by valhi 
exchanges of lyons for halliburton stock result in the company reporting income related to the disposition of the halliburton stock for both financial reporting and income tax purposes  although no cash proceeds are generated by such exchanges 
valhi s potential cash income tax liability that would have been triggered at december   assuming exchanges of all of the outstanding lyons for halliburton stock at such date  was approximately million 
valhi continues to receive regular quarterly halliburton dividends currently 
per share on the escrowed shares 
at december   the lyons had an accreted value equivalent to approximately per halliburton share  and the market price of the halliburton common stock was per share february  market price of halliburton per share 
valhi received approximately million cash in early at the transfer of control of its refined sugar operations to snake river sugar company  including a net million pre closing dividend received from amalgamated 
as part of the transaction  snake river made certain loans to valhi aggregating million in january snake river s sources of funds for its loans to valhi  as well as for the million it contributed to the amalgamated sugar company llc for its voting interest in the llc  included cash capital contributions by the grower members of snake river and million in debt financing provided by valhi in january  of which million was subsequently prepaid in when snake river obtained million of third party term loan financing 
in addition  another million of loans from valhi were prepaid during after these prepayments  million of valhi s loans to snake river sugar company remain outstanding 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
based on the llc s current projections  valhi currently expects that distributions received from the llc in  which are dependent in part upon the future operations of the llc  will approximate its debt service requirements under its million loans from snake river 
certain covenants contained in snake river s third party senior debt limit the amount of debt service payments principal and interest which snake river is permitted to remit to valhi under valhi s million loan to snake river  and such loan is subordinated to snake river s third party senior debt 
due to these covenants  snake river has not made any principal or interest payments on the million loan in other than payment of the accrued and unpaid interest owed as of december  million 
the company does not currently expect that snake river will remit a significant amount of principal or interest during however  such noncollection is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  and the company believes both the accrued and unpaid interest as well as the million principal amount outstanding at december  will ultimately be collected 
redemption of the company s interest in the llc  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  would result in the company reporting income related to the disposition of its llc interest for both financial reporting and income tax purposes  although the net cash proceeds that would be generated from such a disposition would likely be less than the specified redemption price due to snake river s ability to simultaneously call its million loans to valhi 
as a result  such net cash proceeds generated by redemption of the company s interest in the llc could be less than the income taxes that would become payable as a result of the disposition 
the company routinely compares its liquidity requirements and alternative uses of capital against the estimated future cash flows to be received from its subsidiaries  and the estimated sales value of those units 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  repurchase indebtedness in the market or otherwise  modify its dividend policies  consider the sale of interests in subsidiaries  affiliates  business units  marketable securities or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps  to increase liquidity  reduce indebtedness and fund future activities 
such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies 
the company and related entities routinely evaluate acquisitions of interests in  or combinations with  companies  including related companies  perceived by management to be undervalued in the marketplace 
these companies may or may not be engaged in businesses related to the company s current businesses 
the company intends to consider such acquisition activities in the future and  in connection with this activity  may consider issuing additional equity securities and increasing the indebtedness of the company  its subsidiaries and related companies 
from time to time  the company and related entities also evaluate the restructuring of ownership interests among their respective subsidiaries and related companies 
in this regard  the indentures governing the publicly traded debt of nl contain provisions which limit the ability of nl and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or hold noncontrolling interests in business units 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk  and has periodically entered into currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading purposes 
solely in connection with compx s january acquisition of a precision ball bearing slide competitor  on december  compx entered into a short term currency forward contract to purchased nlg million for million  which contract was executed on january  other than this currency forward contract  the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness and certain interest bearing notes receivable 
at december   the company s aggregate indebtedness was split between of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates  by contractual maturity dates  for the company s aggregate indebtedness 
at december   all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars  and all outstanding variable rate borrowings are denominated in deutsche marks and relate to nl 
information shown below for such dm denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using an exchange rate of dm per us dollar 
fair value contractual maturity date thereafter total in millions  except rates fixed rate debt us dollar denominated principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt dm denominated principal amount 

weighted average interest rate the company has an million loan to snake river sugar company at december  such loans bear interest at a fixed interest rate of at december   and the estimated fair value of such loan aggregated million at that date 
the potential decrease in the fair value of such loan resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would be approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the german deutsche mark  canadian dollar  belgian franc  norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december  nl had million of indebtedness denominated in deutsche marks 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates would be approximately million 
marketable equity and debt security prices 
the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which are owned 
the fair value of such debt and equity securities at december  was million 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million 
other 
the company believes there are certain shortcomings in the sensitivity analyses presented above  which analyses are required under the securities and exchange commission s regulations 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
also  certain of the company s marketable securities are exchangeable for certain of the company s debt instruments  and a decrease in the fair value of such securities would likely be mitigated by a decrease in the fair value of the related indebtedness 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events or losses
