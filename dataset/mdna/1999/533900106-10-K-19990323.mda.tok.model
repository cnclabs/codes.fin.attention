information systems implementations and year issue the company is replacing many of its legacy information technology it systems and believes with conversions to new software and computer systems  the year issue will be mitigated 
accordingly  all of the company s business units are actively involved in its year conversion plan 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to replace and test software 
the company is also replacing systems used in the manufacture and distribution of its products and does not anticipate disruptions in the supply of products to its customers 
in addition  to assure continuous flow of products to end customers  the company has surveyed and is now assessing year readiness on the part of the company s supply chain 
the majority of the suppliers responding to the company s survey indicated that they were in the process of implementing their own year compliance programs 
based upon the outcome of the company s final assessment of its external supply chain components  business process and systems contingency plans will be developed and implemented 
although plans have not yet been developed  the company anticipates these plans will include identification of alternative suppliers and increasing inventory safety stocks 
the company s year readiness activities include it areas such as business systems  technical infrastructure and end user computing and non it areas such as manufacturing  warehousing and servicing equipment  environmental operations  supplier base and end products 
these activities require the identification of affected systems and equipment  impact analysis  compliance strategy and implementation and testing of remediation 
the company has completed or is currently on schedule with various phases of its compliance program and has made significant progress towards the completion of its total planned efforts 
the company expects the year compliance efforts to be substantially completed by the second quarter of the incremental cost of information systems expenditures  including system enhancements and non it year projects  is estimated at million  of which million is expected to be capitalized 
at december   approximately million has been capitalized and million has been expensed 
substantially all of the costs to be incurred relate to replacement costs for hardware and software which will provide enhanced functionality over current it systems 
cash flows related to these costs have been and will continue to be provided by funds generated from operations 
the company s total project cost and estimated time to complete the project are based on presently available information 
the company requires periodic project status reporting and cost estimates are revised as information becomes available 
the company plans to complete its it implementation and year projects and have all systems compliant before december  however  there are no assurances that the systems of other companies on which the company relies also will be year compliant 
disruptions caused by suppliers or customers would impair the company s ability to obtain materials and services for production or the ability to sell to customers 
if a disruption occurred  the company would experience lost sales and profits 
the company s assessment and remediation program is addressing this uncertainty but its ability to ascertain the readiness of its suppliers and customers is limited 
any failure by the company to meet its current timetable or by the company s vendors or customers to achieve year compliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s systems  results of operations and financial condition 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including those portions of this management s discussion and analysis that refer to the future may contain forward looking statements that are not historical facts 
those statements are forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements  and the company s future performance  operating results  financial position and liquidity  are subject to a variety of factors that could materially affect results  including litigation 
the company  like other manufacturers  is subject to a variety of lawsuits and potential lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business 
see item legal proceedings within this report and note k to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for further discussion of litigation 
competition 
the company operates in a highly competitive global environment and is subject to a variety of competitive factors such as pricing  the actions and strength of its competitors  and the company s ability to maintain its position as a recognized leader in welding technology 
the intensity of foreign competition is substantially affected by fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies 
the company s competitive position could also be adversely affected should new or emerging entrants particularly where foreign currencies have been significantly devalued become more active in the arc welding business 
international markets 
the company s long term strategy is to increase its share in growing international markets  particularly asia  latin america  central europe and other developing markets 
however  there can be no certainty that the company will be successful in its expansion efforts 
the company is subject to the currency risks of doing business abroad  and expansion poses challenging demands within the company s infrastructure 
further  many developing economies have deteriorated over the last months and are now experiencing significant degrees of political and economic instability  making international growth difficult 
cyclicality and maturity of the welding industry 
the united states arc welding industry is both mature and cyclical 
the growth of the domestic arc welding industry has been and continues to be constrained by numerous factors  including the substitution of plastics and other materials in place of fabricated metal parts in many products and structures 
increased offshore production of fabricated steel structures has also cut into the domestic demand for arc welding products 
operating factors 
the company is highly dependent on its skilled workforce and efficient production facilities  which could be adversely affected by its labor relations  business interruptions at its domestic facilities and short term or long term interruptions in the availability of supplies or raw materials or in transportation of finished goods 
research and development 
the company s continued success depends  in part  on its ability to continue to meet customer welding needs through the introduction of new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics 
there can be no assurances that new products or product improvements  once developed  will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to the operating results of the company  or that product development will continue at a pace to sustain future growth 
item a 
market risk the company s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
the company manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the principal transactions hedged were short term intercompany loans and intercompany purchases 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the income statement 
at december  the company had approximately million notional amount of foreign exchange contracts which hedged recorded balance sheet exposures or firm commitments 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on the company s open foreign exchange contracts at december  would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  the company uses various hedging arrangements to manage the company s exposure to price risk from commodity purchases 
the primary commodity hedged is copper 
these hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods at predetermined prices or ranges of prices the prices the company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices on the company s open commodity futures at december   would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value of the company s cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment portfolio and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
at december   the fair value of notes payable approximated carrying value due to its short term maturities 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the company s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december   and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
the company utilizes an interest rate swap as a hedge to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate of its fixed rate debt without actually changing the debt instrument 
the swap involves the exchange of the company s fixed rate debt for a floating rate based on a month libor basket swap plus a spread of basis points 
payments or receipts on the agreement are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
a increase in the month libor basket swap rate would increase the amount paid by approximately million
