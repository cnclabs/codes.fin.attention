business operations business strategy 
due to the deterioration of the commercial mortgage securitization market during the third and fourth quarters of  the company made significant changes in its business strategy and operations 
the company s business strategy was revised to focus on the origination of smaller balance loans that have higher margins  wider spreads and more profitability 
therefore  the company is concentrating its efforts on the origination of commercialexpress loans and de emphasizing the origination of conduitexpress loans until the commercial mortgage backed securitization market stabilizes 
commercialexpress loans are commercial mortgages with balances generally from  to million while conduitexpress loans are commercial mortgages with balances generally from million to million 
while this decision resulted in lower origination balances in the third and fourth quarters of  the company anticipates better results on the subsequent sale or securitization of its loans 
historically  the company s experience has been that commercialexpress loans have generally had better pricing in the execution of whole loan sales and structured transactions than prices received on conduitexpress loans 
a factor in the higher profitability on commercialexpress loans is the higher interest rate margins on these loans which generally range from basis points to basis points more than interest rate margins on conduitexpress loans 
therefore  in conjunction with the change in business strategy and the resulting decrease in originations during the third and fourth quarters of  the company reduced staff levels at iccc by during the fourth quarter of long term investment operations

liquidity and capital resources overview 
the company s business operations are primarily funded from monthly interest and principal payments from its commercial mortgages and cmbs portfolios  warehouse line and reverse repurchase agreements secured by commercial mortgages and cmbs  cmo financing  proceeds from the sale of commercial mortgages  short term unsecured borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
the acquisition of commercial mortgages and cmbs by the long term investment operations are primarily funded from monthly principal and interest payments  warehouse and reverse repurchase agreements  cmo financing  short term unsecured borrowings and proceeds from the sale of common stock 
the acquisition of commercial mortgages by the conduit operations are funded from reverse repurchase agreements and the sale of commercial mortgages 
the company s ability to meet its long term liquidity requirements is subject to the renewal of its credit and repurchase facilities and or obtaining other sources of financing  including additional debt or equity from time to time 
any decision by the company s lenders and or investors to make additional funds available to the company in the future will depend upon a number of factors  such as compliance with the terms of its existing credit arrangements  financial performance  industry and market trends in various businesses  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing and investments  lenders and or investors own resources and policies concerning loans and investments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the deterioration of the cmbs market created a lack of liquidity for the company as the company s lenders made margin calls on their warehouse and reverse repurchase lines 
margin calls result from the company s lenders evaluating the market value of underlying collateral securing the warehouse lines of credit and requiring additional equity or collateral on the warehouse lines 
these margin calls resulted in the company delaying its third quarter dividend and selling million of commercial mortgages in order to meet its margin calls and provide additional working capital 
the sale of the commercial mortgages increased the company s liquidity by million  at the time of sale  after paying down borrowings on warehouse and reverse repurchase lines 
with net proceeds from the sale of commercial mortgages  the company was able to use these funds to pay its third quarter dividend  which had been suspended  repurchase shares of its capital stock at a price significantly below book value  purchase the remaining ownership interest in its commercial office building from imh and have additional liquidity for general working capital needs 
by selling commercial mortgages  the company reduced its exposure to future margin calls on existing borrowings under its current warehouse lines and repurchase facilities by paying down outstanding borrowings on these facilities 
in addition  by concentrating on the origination of commercialexpress loans which have lower loan balances and higher interest margins  the company s liquidity improved during the fourth quarter of based upon past experience  the company has received better execution  both in terms of price and completion time  on both securitizations and whole loan sales on commercialexpress loans than on conduitexpress loans  which have larger loan balances and smaller interest margins 
also  by de emphasizing originations of conduitexpress loans  loan originations decreased in the third and fourth quarters of and reduced borrowing needs during these periods of market volatility 
the company expects that by originating primarily commercialexpress loans  the length of time specific loans are outstanding on the company s warehouse lines will be reduced 
in addition  the reduction in staff during the fourth quarter of provided additional liquidity from operating activities 
however  cash flows were negatively impacted by the deterioration of the cmbs market and the subsequent sale of commercial mortgages as the company did not benefit from the positive cash flows generated by these financial instruments 
in addition  any future margin calls or termination of warehouse lines or repurchase facilities by the company s lenders may adversely affect the company s future operations 
many former lenders to other companies in the same business as ich are no longer in the business of providing warehouse lines for the funding of commercial mortgages 
this may affect the company s ability to obtain new financing at comparable rates and terms or any new financing at all

the maturity of each class is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral 
equity in the cmos is established at the time the cmos are issued at levels sufficient to achieve desired credit ratings on the securities from rating agencies 
the amount of equity invested in cmos by the long term investment operations is also determined by the company based upon the anticipated return on equity as compared to the estimated proceeds from additional debt issuance

inflation the financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company s operations are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s operations performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
inflation affects the company s operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
during periods of increasing interest rates  demand for mortgage loans and a borrower s ability to qualify for mortgage financing in a purchase transaction may be adversely affected 
during periods of decreasing interest rates  borrowers may prepay their mortgages  which in turn may adversely affect the company s yield and consequently the value of its portfolio of mortgage assets 
year compliance project status the company s year project was approximately complete as of the end of december the company has contracted with an outside vendor to provide coordination  support  testing and implementation in regards to year compliance of hardware and software systems  both on an information technology it and non it level 
the company also has its own in house it department and is currently assisting the outside vendor with year compliance issues 
the company s primary it systems include loan servicing  which is contracted to an outside vendor  loan tracking  and accounting and reporting 
the company has received a year compliance plan from its loan servicing vendor and receives monthly status reports 
as of december  and according to its last status report  the loan servicing vendor is on track with its year compliance plan and expects to be in year compliance by the first half of the loan tracking system is a proprietary system that was written using microsoft access  which is year compliant 
the accounting and reporting systems have been upgraded to versions that are currently year compliant 
the company s non it systems include its file servers  network systems  workstations and communication systems 
testing on all other in house hardware is currently underway and is expected to be complete by the end of the second quarter of the year project is divided into two primary phases  as follows define scope of project and identify all it and non it systems  and testing of existing systems and implementation of new systems  if required 
the outside contractor on the year project submits monthly status reports to the company s it manager and communicates with the it department on a daily basis 
the company s executive committee  which includes the ceo and chairman  president  and chief financial officer  reviews the progress of the company s year project through monthly status reports from the company s it manager 
phase i define scope of project this phase primarily included the inventorying of year items  contacting outside vendors  including reviewing contractual terms and conditions  reviewing internal software for compliance and determining costs to complete the project 
phase i of the project also included the testing and implementation or upgrade of non it systems 
as of the end of october  phase i of the project had been completed 
phase ii testing of systems this phase of the year project can be divided into four separate processes  as follows compliance questionnaires  hardware certification information  software data testing  and hardware testing 
compliance questionnaires and hardware certification information 
as of the end of october  these portions of phase ii were complete 
software data testing 
as of the end of december  this portion of phase ii was approximately complete 
the remaining tasks within this process include analyzing list of software being used  testing all software programs  testing all data from incoming sources  testing all outgoing data processes and reporting 
the company expects that this process will be complete by march  hardware testing 
as of the end of december  this portion of phase ii had not been started 
this phase is contingent on the completion of software data testing 
tasks yet to be started include testing all workstation  servers and network systems 
the company expects to be compliant with all internal year issues by the end of the second quarter of costs the total cost associated with required modifications or installations to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial condition 
the estimated cost of the project is expected to be approximately  as of the end of december  the company had paid  to the outside vendor for completed work on the project 
the majority of the company s estimated cost for the year compliance has been or will be spent on software upgrades and writing new program code to existing proprietary software 
since most of the company s hardware has been purchased within the last two years  the cost of replacing hardware will be minimal 
risks the company does not anticipate any material disruption of its operations as a result of any failure by the company to be compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the need to address the year issue 
the company also relies  directly and indirectly  on other businesses such as third party service providers  creditors and financial organizations and governmental entities 
even if the company s computer systems are not materially adversely affected by the year issue  the company s business and operations could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the operations of the enterprises with which the company interacts 
contingency plans the company believes its year compliance process should enable it to be successful in modifying its computer systems to be year compliant 
as previously stated  acceptance testing and sign off has begun with respect to the company s in house systems 
in addition to year system modification plans  the company has also developed contingency plans for all other systems classified as critical and high risk 
these contingency plans provide timetables to pursue various alternatives based upon the failure of a system to be adequately modified and or sufficiently tested and validated to ensure year compliance 
however  there can be no assurance that either the compliance process or contingency plans will avoid partial or total system interruptions or the costs necessary to update hardware and software would not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general a significant portion of the company s revenues and earnings are derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what management believes to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit  operational and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk which could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities interest rate risk is the responsibility of the asset and liability committee alco  which reports to the board of director s of the company 
alco establishes policies that monitor and coordinate the company s sources  uses and pricing of its funds 
the company attempts to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds that amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates  theoretically  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest bearing liabilities reprice 
the company manages its interest rate risk by  retaining adjustable rate commercial mortgages to be held for long term investment  selling fixed rate commercial mortgages on a whole loan basis  and securitizing both adjustable and fixed rate commercial mortgages through the issuance of cmos 
the company retains adjustable rate commercial mortgages  which are generally indexed to six month libor and reprice every six months  to be held for investment or as cmo collateral 
the index on adjustable rate commercial mortgages provide a comparable match to the one month libor index that is used for the funding of commercial mortgages on the company s warehouse line agreements 
in addition  the company securitizes both variable fixed rate commercial mortgages as cmos to reduce its interest rate risk as cmos provide a net interest spread between the interest income on the commercial mortgages and the interest and other expenses associated with the cmo financing 
to a great extent  market risk arising from early prepayment of commercial mortgages is minimized as the company uses short term prepayment lock outs and prepayment penalties 
as a result of this strategy  the company s total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceed interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in one year by million  representing a positive gap 
therefore  the company s net interest income would be negatively affected by decreases in interest rates as interest earning assets would reprice to lower interest rates faster than would interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  in an increasing interest rate environment the company s net interest income would increase as more interest earning assets would reprice to higher rates faster than would interest bearing liabilities 
as a rule  the company attempts to keep the cumulative difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as low as possible over a one year cycle 
the company currently does not maintain a trading portfolio 
as a result  the company is not exposed to market risk as it relates to trading activities 
the company s investment securities portfolio are held for sale which requires the company to perform market valuations of the portfolio in order to properly record the portfolio at the lower of cost or market 
therefore  the company continually monitors the interest rates of its investment securities portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability

interest sensitive assets and liabilities are based upon contractual maturity and repricing date 
amounts are based on the unpaid principal balance of commercial mortgages at december  excludes bond discount 
in addition to measuring interest rate risk via a gap analysis  the company measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
the company estimates its interest income for the next twelve months assuming no changes in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  calculations are made for each of the defined changes in interest rates 
those results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income 
assuming immediate interest rate decreases of and basis points  the company estimates that the decrease in net interest income would be  or  and million  or  respectively 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided on commercial mortgage assets and borrowings on commercial mortgage assets  only  with respect to changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes attributable to changes in rate changes in volume multiplied by prior volume  changes in interest due to both rate and volume and the net change

long term investment operations to the extent consistent with ich s election to qualify as a reit  the company follows a hedging program intended to protect against interest rate changes and to enable the company to earn net interest income in periods of generally rising  as well as declining or static  interest rates 
specifically  the company s hedging program is formulated with the intent to offset the potential adverse effects resulting from interest rate adjustment limitations on its mortgage loans and mbss and the differences between the interest rate adjustment indices and interest rate adjustment periods of its adjustable rate mortgage loans secured by such loans and related borrowings 
as part of its hedging program  the company also monitors on an ongoing basis the prepayment risks that arise in fluctuating interest rate environments 
the company s hedging program encompasses a number of procedures 
the company will structure its borrowing agreements to have a range of different maturities 
as a result  the company may adjust the average maturity of its borrowings on an ongoing basis by changing the mix of maturities as borrowings come due and are renewed 
in this way  the company would minimize any differences between interest rate adjustment periods of mortgage loans and related borrowings that may occur due to prepayments of mortgage loans or other factors 
the company may occasionally purchase interest rate caps to limit or partially offset adverse changes in interest rates associated with its borrowings 
in a typical interest rate cap agreement  the cap purchaser makes an initial lump sum cash payment to the cap seller in exchange for the seller s promise to make cash payments to the purchaser on fixed dates during the contract term if prevailing interest rates exceed the rate specified in the contract 
in this way  the company generally hedges as much of the interest rate risk arising from lifetime rate caps on mortgage loans and from periodic rate and or payment caps as the company determines is in the best interests of the company  given the cost of such hedging transactions and the need to maintain ich s status as a reit 
such periodic caps on the company s mortgage loans may also be hedged by the purchase of mortgage derivative securities 
mortgage derivative securities can be effective hedging instruments in certain situations as the value and yields of some of these instruments tend to increase as interest rates rise and tend to decrease in value and yields as interest rates decline  while the experience for others is the converse 
the company intends to limit its purchases of mortgage derivative securities to investments that qualify as qualified reit assets or qualified hedges so that income from such investments will constitute qualifying income for purposes of the and gross income tests 
to a lesser extent  the company  through its conduit operations  may enter into interest rate swap agreements  buy and sell financial futures contracts and options on financial futures contracts and trade forward contracts as a hedge against future interest rate changes  however  the company will not invest in these instruments unless the company and the manager are exempt from the registration requirements of the commodity exchange act or otherwise comply with the provisions of that act 
the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of may restrict the company s ability to purchase certain instruments and may severely restrict the company s ability to employ other strategies 
in all its hedging transactions  the company deals only with counterparties that the company believes are sound credit risks 
as of december  and  the company had no outstanding interest rate cap or interest rate swap agreements or other derivative instruments 
conduit operations in conducting its conduit operations  iccc is subject to the risk of rising mortgage interest rates between the time it commits to originate or purchase commercial mortgages at a fixed price or rate and the time it sells or securitizes those commercial mortgages 
to mitigate this risk  iccc enters into transactions designed to hedge interest rate risks  which may include mandatory and optional forward selling of commercial mortgages and buying and selling of futures and options on futures and us treasury obligations 
the nature and quantity of these hedging transactions are determined by the management of iccc or the manager  based on various factors  including market conditions and the average duration of the mortgage loans and the expected subordination of the mortgage loans upon securitization 
futures contracts to remain competitive and control risk  iccc uses futures and options on futures 
the use of these instruments provides for increased liquidity  lower transaction costs and more effective short term coverage than cash and mortgage backed securities 
however  iccc is vulnerable to the basis risk that is inherent in cross hedging 
iccc uses the buying and selling of futures contracts on treasury bonds and treasury notes when the market is vulnerable to day to day corrections 
executing hedges with these instruments allows iccc to more effectively hedge the risks of corrections or reverses in the market without committing mandatory sales on mortgage backed securities or cash 
iccc utilizes these instruments on a short term basis to fine tune its overall hedge position at a lower cost 
the company sells future contracts against five and ten year treasury notes with major dealers in such securities 
at december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  in outstanding commitments to sell us treasury notes
