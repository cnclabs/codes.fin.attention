results of operations overview we develop  market and support network storage management software products for heterogeneous client server computing environments and large scale enterprises 
our networker family of software products  from which we derive a substantial majority of our revenue  support many storage management server platforms and can accommodate a variety of servers  clients  applications  databases and storage devices 
we license our products through resellers and directly to end users primarily located in north america  europe and asia pacific 
we also license our source code to original equipment manufacturers oems in exchange for initial licensing fees and receive ongoing royalties from the oems product sales 
substantially all of the oems are large computer system and software suppliers located in the united states  europe and asia pacific 
we acquired software moguls  inc in august primarily for its product offerings and research and development team 
we do not expect software moguls  inc to have a significant impact on our results of operations 
selected elements of our consolidated financial statements are shown below for the last three years as a percentage of total revenue and as a percentage change from year to year 
increase of total revenue years ended december  compared compared to to revenue product licenses service and support total revenue cost of revenue product licenses service and support gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles merger related expenses in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest income  net provision for income taxes net income revenue total revenue was million in  million in and million in total revenue increased percent from to and percent from to total revenue increased primarily as a result of the continued acceptance of our networker family of products  increased sales of service and support contracts  as well as increased royalty revenue 
product license revenue 
product license revenue was million in  million in and million in product license revenue increased percent from to and percent from to product license revenue increased primarily as a result of the continued market acceptance of our products 
product license revenue also increased as a result of product sales to large scale enterprises 
the increase in our number of sales and marketing personnel  as well as sales programs helped to increase the market acceptance of our products and product sales 
our sales and marketing personnel increased from employees in to employees in we recognize product revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of resulting receivables is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable  except for sales to domestic distributors  which are recognized upon sale by the domestic distributors to end users 
we recognize revenue from domestic distributors upon sale by the distributor to end users since these distributors have unlimited rights of return and we historically have not been able to make reasonable estimates of product returns from these distributors 
product license revenue also includes royalty payments received from product sales by oems  which were million in  million in and million in we recognize product revenue from royalty payments upon receipt of quarterly royalty reports from oems related to their product sales for the previous quarter 
prior growth rates of our product license revenue are not indicative of future product license revenue growth rates and may not be sustainable in the future 
service and support revenue 
service and support revenue was million in  million in and million in service and support revenue increased percent from to and percent from to service and support revenue increased primarily as a result of the growth in the number of registered customers electing to subscribe to support contracts and to renew software support contracts after the initial one year term 
our increase in internal staffing for software support helped to increase new sales and renewals of our software support contracts 
our increase in internal staffing for education and consulting services resulted in increased sales of the education and consulting services we offer 
our technical support personnel increased from employees in to employees in our consulting and education services personnel increased from employees in to employees in we collect fees for ongoing customer support and product updates in advance and recognize this support revenue ratably over the period of the contract 
for education and consulting services  we recognize revenue when such services are performed 
prior growth rates of our software service and support revenue are not indicative of future software service and support revenue growth rates and may not be sustainable in the future 
international product license revenue accounted for percent of total revenue in  percent in and percent in international license revenue increased primarily as a result of the continued market acceptance of our products overseas 
an increase in the number of international sales offices and international distributors and resellers marketing our products helped increase the market acceptance of our products overseas 
the majority of international sales during these periods were made in europe and canada 
we established sales offices in canada and the netherlands during  sales offices in japan and sweden during and sales offices in belgium  hong kong  italy  poland and switzerland during we believe that our continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of our international operations 
in order to successfully expand international sales in and subsequent periods  we must continue to establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
expansion and management of our international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and could seriously harm certain operating results if such efforts are not successful 
to the extent that we are unable to effect these additions in a timely manner  our growth  if any  in international revenue will be limited  and our business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
our international sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in those markets 
in some markets  localization of our products is essential to achieve market penetration 
we may incur substantial costs and experience delays in localizing our products  and we cannot guarantee that any localized product will ever generate significant revenue

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing percent of total revenue in  percent in and percent in research and development expenses increased percent from to and percent from to the increases in research and development expenses in absolute dollars primarily reflect increased staffing and associated support for engineers necessary to expand and enhance our product line 
the number of research and development personnel increased from employees in to employees in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased primarily as a result of research and development expenses increasing at a slower rate than the increase in total revenue

the increases in absolute dollars of general and administrative expenses from to were primarily attributable to increased staffing and related costs required to manage and support our expansion 
general and administrative personnel increased from employees in to employees in we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was million for each of  and we recorded the related intangibles following an acquisition in the first quarter of we amortize these intangibles on a straight line basis over five years 
merger related expenses 
in connection with the our acquisition of software moguls  inc during the third quarter of  we incurred merger related expenses of  consisting primarily of investment bankers  attorneys and accountants fees

if the losses of software moguls  inc  had been reflected in our financial statements in  the effective tax rate would have been percent 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the decrease in the effective tax rate from to was primarily a result of the reinstatement of the federal research and experimental tax credit 
we anticipate that the tax rate for may increase primarily as a result of the expected statutory expiration of the research and development credit and impact of non deductible merger expenses 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million at december  and represented percent of total assets 
cash and cash equivalents increased million during cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less 
investments consist mainly of short term and long term municipal securities 
at december   we had no long term debt and stockholders equity was million 
we have financed our operations to date primarily by cash from operations and sales of common stock

we believe our current cash balances and cash flow from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products include coding to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
our computer systems and or software will need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such problems 
we have conducted year compliance reviews for current versions of our products 
the reviews include 
assessment  
implementation  
validation testing  and 
contingency planning 
we respond to customer concerns about our products on a case by case basis 
although we have performed validation testing to ensure our products are year compliant and believe our software products are year compliant  our software products may not contain all the necessary software routines and programs for the accurate calculation  display  storage and manipulation of data involving dates 
failures of our software products to contain all the necessary software routines and programs for the accurate calculation  display  storage and manipulation of data involving dates would seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have tested software obtained from third parties that is incorporated into our products  and seek assurances from vendors that licensed software is year compliant 
despite such testing and assurances  products incorporated into our products may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
known or unknown errors or defects in our products may result in 
delay or loss of revenue  
diversion of development resources  
damage to our reputation  or 
increased service and warranty costs 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could seriously harm our business  operating results  or financial condition 
to the extent information is publicly available  we have assessed the year compliance status of our customers 
if our current or future customers fail to achieve year compliance or if they divert technology expenditures to address year compliance problems  our business  results of operations  or financial condition could be seriously harmed 
we believe the software and hardware we use internally comply with year requirements 
during  we replaced or upgraded much of our internal use hardware and software 
in addition  we are not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing our internal use software and hardware for the year however  serious  unanticipated negative consequences  including material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal systems may occur 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
we have funded our year compliance review from operating cash flows and have not separately accounted for these costs in the past 
we will incur additional amounts related to the year compliance review including 
administrative personnel to manage the review  and 
outside contractors to provide technical advice and technical support for our products  product engineering  and customer satisfaction 
we are developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of our efforts to identify and correct year problems 
depending on the systems affected  these plans include 
accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  
short to medium term use of backup equipment and software  
increased work hours for our personnel or use of contract personnel to correct on an accelerated schedule any year problems that arise or to provide manual workarounds for information systems  and 
other similar approaches if we are required to implement any of these contingency plans  it could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be seriously impacted by  among other things 
the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  
vendors ability to modify proprietary software  and 
unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review 
financial risk management as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could seriously harm our financial results 
all of our international sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and  therefore  reduce the demand for our products 
reduced demand for our products could seriously harm our financial results 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
our investment portfolio consists of both fixed and variable rate financial instruments 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of taxes 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could seriously harm the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
thereafter total municipal securities    average interest rate auction rate receipts   average interest rate recent pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the balance sheet  and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  currently  we do not hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee  or acsec  released statement of position  or sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires companies to capitalize certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  provided that those costs are not research and development 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the requirements of sop and the effects  if any  on our current policies on accounting for software costs 
in december  acsec released statement of position  or sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
sop amends sop to require that an entity recognize revenue for multiple element arrangements by means of the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair values of all the undelivered elements that are not accounted for by means of long term contract accounting  vsoe of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements  and all revenue recognition criteria of sop other than the requirement for vsoe of the fair value of each delivered element are satisfied 
the provisions of sop that extend the deferral of certain paragraphs of sop became effective december  these paragraphs of sop and sop will be effective for transactions that are entered into in fiscal years beginning after march  retroactive application is prohibited 
we are evaluating the requirements of sop and the effects  if any  on our current revenue recognition policies
