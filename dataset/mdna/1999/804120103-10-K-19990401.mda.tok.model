the liquidity of the company is contingent upon a number of factors  principally the company s future operating results 
management believes that the company s current cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and internally generated funds are adequate to meet its working capital requirements and to fund its capital investment needs and debt service payments 
inflation and currency risk the effect of inflation on the company s results of operations over the past three years has been minimal 
the impact of currency fluctuation on the purchase of inventory by the company from foreign suppliers has been minimal as the transactions were denominated in us dollars

the company has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to minimize the transaction currency risk 
year the company views its exposure to the year problem in three areas i internal computer systems used to manage the company s business  ii microprocessors and other electronic devices included as components of equipment used by the company embedded chips and iii computer systems used by suppliers and customers of the company 
the company s plan  under the coordination of the vice president management information systems  is to resolve its internal year problems in these areas following sequential phases of evaluation  updating and testing 
in the evaluation phase  the company reviews the applicable system to identify year problems and determines any necessary remediation 
the updating and testing phases involve the implementation and testing  respectively  of year remediation measures 
based on its current evaluation of its exposure to the year problem  the company has determined that it will have to modify or replace portions of its software  computer and other equipment systems 
the company incurred costs of approximately  in fiscal and expects to incur additional costs of between  to  in fiscal related to year modifications 
to date  the company has completed evaluation of substantially all of its internal computer systems and embedded chips and has completed the majority of necessary upgrades 
it is expected that full evaluation  updating and testing will be completed during the third quarter of the company has interviewed key suppliers to determine their capability to continue providing goods and services 
based on responses from over of those surveyed  the company believes that these suppliers are either year compliant or will be made year compliant on a timely basis 
nevertheless  the company continues to expand its understanding of the year problems to its significant business partners based on ongoing surveys and interviews and this process will continue throughout contingency plans for supply disruptions are in the process of being formulated and are expected to be completed by third quarter the company has also interviewed key customers and all those who utilize electronic data interface edi as the principal means of placing orders 
the responses received indicate that most customers are in the process of developing or executing remediation plans to address year problems 
the company believes that customers present a potential year business risk because of the company s limited ability to influence their actions or internal processes 
the foregoing discussion of the company s year readiness contains forward looking statements  and were derived using numerous assumptions 
despite the company s belief that its year program reduces the risk of an internal compliance failure and is taking an active approach to assess the readiness of its business partners  there can be no assurances that all parties will achieve timely year compliance or that such noncompliance will not have a material adverse impact to the company 
accounting pronouncements sfas in june  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas establishes the reporting standards for operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information on operating statements in interim financial statements 
sfas revised the disclosure requirements for segment reporting by defining the characteristics and quantitative thresholds for which segment information is required to be disclosed 
the company adopted sfas in and all prior period amounts have been restated 
sfas in june  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  which is effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years commencing after june   with early adoption permitted 
sfas defines the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities 
upon adoption of sfas  all derivatives must be recognized on the balance sheet at their then fair value and any deferred gains or losses remaining on the balance sheet under previous hedge accounting rules must be removed from the balance sheet 
in the period of adoption  the transition adjustments may effect current earnings and may effect other comprehensive income 
sfas requires companies to recognize adjustments to the fair value of derivatives that are not hedges currently in earnings when they occur 
for derivatives that qualify as hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives can be recognized currently in earnings  along with an offsetting adjustment against the basis of the underlying hedged item or be deferred in other comprehensive income 
the company is assessing the impact of the provisions of sfas on its hedging activities  which are currently limited to forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on current earnings or on the company s financial position  however  at this time  the effect of the adoption of sfas on the company s future earnings and financial position cannot be estimated 
sop in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires that all costs of start up activities  including organization costs  be expensed as incurred 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sop in the first quarter of fiscal  the initial application of which will not have a material effect on earnings or on the company s financial position 
certain other factors that may affect future results risks and uncertainties could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those reflected by forward looking statements or otherwise implied by management from time to time 
competition competition is intense in the markets in which the company sells its products 
the company competes against a large number of other companies  both domestic and foreign  with substantially greater resources than the company 
the principal competitors for the company s saucony products are nike  new balance and asics 
the principal competitors for the company s bicycle products are cannondale and trek 
the principal competitors for hind are nike  pearl izumi and tyr 
foreign currency exchange rates the company s financial results have  from time to time  been adversely affected by the fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to reduce currency exchange losses will be successful or that currency exchange rates will not have an adverse impact on the company s future operating results and financial condition 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the timing and shipment of individual orders  market acceptance of new products offered by the company  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  mix of products sold  changes in product pricing and general economic conditions 
it is possible that in some future quarter the company s revenue or operating results will be below expectations of stock investors 
if that were to occur  the market price of the common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on consumer preferences the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business based upon footwear fashion trends  particularly on its jazz original product offerings  and frequently changing consumer preferences and product demands 
the company believes that its success depends in substantial part on its ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner 
moreover  the company could be materially and adversely affected by conditions in the retail industry in general  including consolidation and the resulting decline in the number of retailers and other cyclical economic factors 
dependence on major customers one key customer accounted for more than of the company s consolidated revenue during other major accounts also provide significant portions of the company s overall revenues which could be adversely impacted by the loss of any key account 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
almost all borrowings of the company are based on floating rates which would increase interest expense in an environment of rising interest rates 
the company has a policy of selectively hedging foreign currency risks  but there are no assurances that this program will fully insulate against short term fluctuations in financial results
