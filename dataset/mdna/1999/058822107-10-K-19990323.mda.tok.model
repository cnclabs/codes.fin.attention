item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity historically have been and are expected to continue to be cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under short term lines of credit 
in  this was supplemented by a  five year term loan used to finance equipment purchases 
if the company continues to expand at a rate similar to  this is expected to require a higher level of capital expenditures than has been experienced in the past to support such growth 
the company may  accordingly  seek long term financing for significant capital expenditures in the future 
the company s financial position remains strong 
at december   the company had working capital of million compared to million at december  cash was provided and used in varying amounts during the two year period  principally as a result of changes in the elements of current assets and current liabilities and in the amount of cash provided by net income 
inventories increased in both years due to new products  particularly foam products in  and buildup for anticipated increases in sales 
cash used in investing activities for the three year period was due to increased investments in balsa plantations  replacement of old equipment  structural improvements of the shrimp ponds and purchase of new equipment required for the manufacture of the company s new products 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company had unused lines of credit of approximately million with a domestic bank  approximately million with ecuadorian banks and approximately million with european banks for working capital purposes 
the company expects that future operations and its unused lines of credit will provide sufficient resources to support its planned expansion and maintain its favorable liquid position 
result of operations for the years ended december   and total sales increased  and in  and  respectively 
the gains in all three years were due to increased core materials and shrimp sales 
core material sales were   and  in  and  respectively 
the continued robust economy has resulted in strong demand in all industries that use core materials  including the largest customer group  the boating industry 
many of the company s end user markets  including boating  are highly cyclical 
demand within those industries is dependent upon  among other factors  inflation  interest rates and consumer confidence 
fluctuating interest rates and other changes in economic conditions make it difficult to forecast short or long range trends 
increases in core material sales in are also attributable to sales of foam products that were introduced in the increase in core material sales in compared to was attributable to improved pricing and volume 
shrimp sales were   and  in  and  respectively 
the increases in all three years were the result of higher volume of shrimp shipped  the average selling price decreased slightly in compared to the gross margin increased in and in and  the margins for the company s core products improved  primarily due to improved pricing 
the gross margin from shrimp sales decreased in and the decrease in both years is attributable to a higher volume of shrimp purchased from outside suppliers  which have lower margins than shrimp grown at the company s own farms 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined in and the decline in both years was due primarily to a better absorption of fixed expenses  primarily general and administrative expenses  as a result of increased sales 
sales and expenses were affected in all three years by the different exchange rates applied in translating the books of accounts of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
interest expense increased all three years 
in  the company continued to borrow money for working capital purposes in ecuador in local currency sucre denominated loans as a natural hedge of the net investment in ecuador 
although these loans bear higher interest rates than us dollar loans  the company expects to partially offset these higher interest rates with gains resulting from the expected devaluation of the sucre 
this practice increased interest expense in as compared to but created a corresponding foreign exchange gain 
the company s interest rate on us loans was lower in and its average borrowings were slightly higher in as compared to the level of borrowing in all periods is related to the company s working capital needs and cash flows generated from operations 
the company had a foreign exchange gain of  in compared to losses of  and  in and  respectively 
in march and september of  the ecuadorian government weakened its currency s trading band against the dollar effectively devaluing the local currency 
translation gains and losses are mainly caused by the relationship of the us dollar to the foreign currencies in the countries where the company operates  and arise when translating foreign currency balance sheets into us dollars 
the company utilizes foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain inventory purchases and may also employ certain strategies whose objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
the company has not and does not intend to enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
management is unable to forecast the impact of translation gains or losses on future periods due to the unpredictability in the fluctuation of foreign exchange 
the effective income tax rate amounted to in  in and in reconciliation of the effective rate with the us statutory rate is detailed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
conversion to the euro currency on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency  the euro 
primarily through its european sales offices  the company conducts business in member countries 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro will be between january  and june  the company is addressing the issues involved with the introduction of the euro  including converting information technology systems  currency risk and processing tax and accounting issues 
based upon its review to date  the euro is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s business operations and therefore will not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any program software and hardware  as well as certain equipment and machinery  that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities for both the company and its customers who rely on its products 
the company has divided the year issue into two main areas internal information technology it and non it systems  including embedded technology such as microprocessors  and external agents including critical suppliers  customers and other third parties the company utilizes for various processing functions 
the company is in the process of installing a new  fully integrated enterprise resource planning erp system purchased from a third party vendor 
the erp software is year compliant 
implementation of mission critical systems is expected to be completed in the second quarter of  other non critical systems are scheduled to be completed during the first and second quarters of the decision to invest in a new erp system was driven by the need for a fully integrated management information system to support the planned growth of the company and not specifically to address year compliance issues 
to fully utilize the capabilities of the erp software and modernize its existing systems the company has invested approximately  in new computer hardware and networking hardware and software in an investment of this size in hardware is not expected on an annual basis hereafter  although additional investments will be required in the future to enhance the company s use of information technology and computer hardware 
efforts to implement the erp system and address certain year issues are being accomplished concurrently 
it is not practical therefore to distinguish and estimate certain year compliance costs  especially as they relate to the company s information technology 
total internal and external costs in to implement the erp system  purchase new computer hardware and upgrade its existing network was approximately  additional external costs to implement the mission critical and certain other modules are expected to be approximately  in hardware costs have been capitalized  internal costs and nearly all external costs have been expensed as incurred 
certain expenditures will be required in the future to maintain the technology base of the company  such expenditures in the future are not expected to be material 
the company may decide to utilize additional capabilities of its erp system and make use of other information technologies as they become available in the marketplace 
these expenditures will be largely discretionary in that they are not mission critical systems and will be evaluated using a methodology similar to that used by the company to evaluate other capital expenditures 
current plans call for the erp system to be implemented in the us only  not in the company s european or ecuadorian subsidiaries 
the company has identified all significant it and non it applications that will require modification at these locations 
completion of the modifications is expected by the end of march in ecuador and by june in europe 
the company is in the process of assessing its year exposure as it pertains to non it systems  including manufacturing process control and key third party relationships  such as vendors and customers 
this includes the process of identifying and prioritizing critical suppliers and customers and communicating with them about their plans and progress in addressing the year problem 
the company also utilizes third party vendors for processing data and payments  eg  payroll services  k plan administration  check processing  medical benefits processing  etc 
the company has initiated communications with these vendors to determine the status of their systems 
should these vendors not be compliant in a timely manner  the company may be required to process transactions manually or delay processing until such time as the vendors are year compliant 
the review of non it systems and key third party relationships is expected to be completed by the end of march although the company anticipates that minimal business disruption will occur as a result of year issues  there is no guarantee that possible worst case year issues of third party vendors and suppliers would not impact the company 
to date the company has not developed a formal contingency plan for non compliance and will develop such plans as necessary based on information obtained from third parties  as well as the evaluation of its it and non it systems 
the future costs of the company s year efforts are expected to be funded through existing cash resources and future operating cash flows 
the requirements for the correction of year issues and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s current best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that may cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and collect all relevant computer data and similar uncertainties 
forward looking statements cautionary factors the foregoing discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements regarding the company 
because such statements include risks and uncertainties  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  economic conditions in the united states  europe and ecuador that affect relative interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other costs and prices related to the company s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices  foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates 
to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases of materials created in the normal course of business  the company enters into a limited number of derivative hedging transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency firm commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
the deferred gains and losses on these instruments at december  were not material 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in addition  in order to hedge currency exposures related to the net investments in foreign subsidiaries  the company utilizes local currency and us dollar denominated financing entered into by the subsidiaries 
the company manages interest rate cost relating to these financings by using variable interest rates 
although the use of variable interest rate bearing debt instruments has the potential for market risk  the company s overall interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended december  would not be materially affected by a near term change in interest rates 
for quantitative disclosure regarding the company s derivative instruments see note to the consolidated financial statements
