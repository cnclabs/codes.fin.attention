year compliance the year issue involves computer programs and embedded microprocessors in computer systems and other equipment that utilize two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
these systems may be programmed to assume that all two digit dates are preceded by  causing to be interpreted as versus this could result in the possible failure of those programs and devices to properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize date sensitive information could generate erroneous data or a system failure 
the company s objective is to ensure an uninterrupted transition into year and has a plan currently in place 
the scope of the year plan includes information technology it such as software and hardware  non it systems or embedded technology such as microcontrollers contained in various manufacturing and lab equipment  environmental and safety systems  facilities and utilities and company products with date sensitivity  and readiness of key third parties  including suppliers  customers and key financial institutions 
the company has a formal year compliance project that addresses the company s information technology systems

phases through have been completed 
phase is currently in process and is scheduled for completion by july phases and are on schedule to be completed by the end of phase will continue into the year the company has requested written confirmation from what it believes to be all of its significant vendors as to their year compliance status  and has taken steps to determine the extent to which the company s systems are vulnerable to those third parties failures to remedy their own year issues 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies with which the company does business will be timely converted or that any such failure to upgrade or convert would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems and operations 
however responses to date have indicated no significant problems 
through year end january   the company has incurred less than  of year cost and expects to spend less than  during each of and all costs associated with year compliance are being funded with cash flow generated from operations and existing cash balances and are being expensed as incurred 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario arising from the year issue is a temporary interruption in the company s operations resulting from non compliant systems of third parties 
based on the status of its year compliance program  the company currently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company s internal computer systems 
however  the company does not have  nor plan to have  a formal contingency plan in the event its year compliance program is unsuccessful or not completed on a timely basis
