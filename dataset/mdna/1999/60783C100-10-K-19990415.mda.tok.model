item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general since its inception in  the company s principal business has been the design  manufacture  marketing and installation of modular relocatable classrooms 
the company s primary customers consist of individual school districts located in california and the state of california 
the need for new classrooms in california school districts is generally governed by the number of students per class  which is a function of the net migration of families into and out of school districts and the total number of new students entering the school system in any given year 
specific provisions of california legislation govern the amount of the state s budget that must be directed toward the public school system 
a portion of these funds may be allocated for the addition of new classrooms 
in addition  the state can raise funds to build or add new classrooms through the issuance of general obligation bonds 
see business legislation and funding 
in the early to mid s  california suffered through a recession that resulted in statewide budgetary constraints 
during this period  the amount of state funds available for the addition of new classrooms was severely limited 
as a result  the company experienced a decline in net sales in and  and net sales in and were essentially the same as those generated in in response  the company initiated a cost control program that included layoffs of approximately of its staff as compared to the june work force  and temporarily closed its plant in lathrop  california 
in addition  the chief executive officer of the company agreed to a salary reduction and each of the company s other top management personnel agreed to a salary reduction 
due in large measure to the amelioration of the state budget crises and the realization that the need for new classrooms in california far exceeded supply  beginning in the second half of and continuing into and  the state has increased the amount of funds targeted specifically for the addition of new classrooms 
in november  the state implemented the class size reduction program  the goal of which is to reduce public school class sizes in kindergarten through the third grade 
for the school year the state spent million under this program  including million specifically for facilities  which may be relocatable classrooms 
primarily as a result of the implementation of the class size reduction program  the company s net sales increased to million in as compared to million for the year ended december  and million in in addition  a billion school construction bond issue was approved in november billion of the bond issue is allocated for growth and new construction and billion for modernization and reconstruction through the year it additionally allocated million for class size reductions to fully implement the program from kindergarten through third grade 
see business legislation and funding 
in response to the increased demand for its modular relocatable classrooms  the company re opened the northern california lathrop plant in and expanded its southern california production capacity in perris in results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of net sales represented by certain items in the company s statements of operations 
percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income expense  net other income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million in the decrease in was due in part to the fact that the california legislature was more than two months late in passing the state budget 
additionally  there was a delay in allocating the funds from the billion school construction bond issue which was passed in november for the year ended december   gross profit was million  an increase of million  or approximately  over gross profit of million

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  an increase of million  or approximately  from million in the increase in was due principally to the amelioration of the state of california budget deficit and the implementation during the year of the class size reduction program for kindergarten through third grade classes in california s public elementary schools

liquidity and capital resources since the financing described below  the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures with cash generated internally by operations  supplemented by borrowings under various credit facilities 
during the years ended december   and  the company s operations provided used cash in the amounts of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had approximately million in cash 
the company s revolving loan facility  which was scheduled to expire in september  was paid off on december  the company had working capital of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
in  current assets increased by million  with an increase of million in cash  an increase of million in deferred tax assets and an increase of million in due from affiliates  offset by a decrease of million in contracts receivable and a decrease of million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
current liabilities decreased by million  with various accrued liabilities and current maturities of long term debt decreasing by million and million  respectively  offset by a million increase in accounts payable 
in  contracts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts increased by million and million  respectively  as the company s net sales increased significantly due to the implementation of the state s class size reduction program 
accrued liabilities increased by million in  also as a result of the increase in net sales 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  the majority of expenditures were as a result of the re opening of the company s lathrop  california manufacturing facility 
in and  the majority of expenditures were related to the construction of an additional production line at one of its perris  california facilities 
the company had a million industrial development bond issued by the industrial development authority of the county of san joaquin  california  the net proceeds of which were used to partially finance the million cost of construction of the company s lathrop  california facility 
the loan was paid in full during in may  the company raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of  shares of series a preferred stock to several private investors who are selling shareholders in this offering the financing 
in april  all of the series a preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock 
in december  warrants issued to the investors in connection with the financing were exercised  resulting in cash proceeds to the company of approximately million and the issuance of  additional shares of common stock 
management believes that the company s existing product lines and manufacturing capacity will enable the company to generate sufficient cash through operations  supplemented by periodic use of holding s bank line of credit  to finance the company s business over the next twelve months 
however  additional cash resources may be required if the company s rate of growth exceeds currently anticipated levels 
moreover  it may prove necessary for the company to construct or acquire additional manufacturing facilities in order for the company to compete effectively in new market areas or states which are beyond a mile radius from one of its production facilities 
the construction or acquisition of new facilities could require significant additional capital 
for these reasons  among others  the company may need additional debt or equity financing in the future 
there can be  however  no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such additional financing  or that any such financing will be available on terms acceptable to it 
new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  application of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
year the year issue concerns the potential exposures related to the automated generation of business and financial misinformation resulting from the application of computer programs which have been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year of business transactions 
when the year begins  programs with such date related logic will not be able to distinguish between the years and  potentially causing software and hardware to fail  generating erroneous calculations or presenting information in an unusable format 
the company is dependent on multiple computer servers and the third party computer programs running on them to provide data in support of its accounting and engineering functions 
in recognition of the potential year problem  in november  the company began a program to replace all of its existing engineering and accounting software with new software that is warranted by its vendors as being year compliant 
the software replacement program was completed in november at a total cost of approximately  spi s computer data is currently being transferred to the company s computer system 
the company estimates that this transfer will be completed by the end of the second quarter of at a cost of approximately  the company has relationships with various third parties on whom it relies to provide goods and services necessary for the manufacture and distribution of its products 
these include suppliers and vendors 
as part of its determination of year readiness  the company had identified material relationships with third party vendors and is in the process of assessing the status of their compliance through the use of questionnaires 
the company expects this process will be completed by the second quarter of at a cost of approximately the total cost of the company s year efforts  including hardware  software  related consulting costs  assessment of third party compliance  and transfer of spi data is estimated to be about  and is not material to the company s financial statements 
the company s construction materials are available through numerous independent sources 
due to the broad diversification of these sources  the risk associated with potential business interruptions as a result of year non compliance by one or more sources is not considered significant 
the company s primary customers are california school districts  each of which obtains its funds for paying the company s invoices through the computer system operated by the state of california 
if this system does not properly function after january   it could result in a temporary shutdown of portions of the state government  in which case  payment of the company s invoices would be delayed  and new purchase orders may not be processed 
if the shutdown lasted for more than days  the company would experience a severe cash shortage and a material decline in revenue during the period of the government shutdown 
the cash shortage can be alleviated to some degree by borrowings from holding s line of credit and by reductions in work force and possible temporary plant closures 
the company does not believe it can design or implement any other contingency plans that will mitigate the effects of such a government shutdown 
it is anticipated that the steps the company has taken and is continuing to take deal with the year problem will reduce the risk of significant business interruption  but there is no assurance that this outcome will be achieved 
failure to detect and correct all internal instances of non compliance or the inability of third parties to achieve timely compliance could result in the interruption of normal business operations which could  depending on its duration  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
seasonality historically  the company s quarterly revenues have been highest in the second and third quarters of each calendar year because a large number of orders for modular classrooms placed by school districts require that classrooms be constructed  delivered and installed in time for the upcoming new school year which generally commences in september 
the company has typically been able to add employees as needed to respond to the corresponding increases in manufacturing output required by such seasonality to meet currently foreseeable increases in this seasonal demand 
in addition  the company s operating margins may vary on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of revenues between standardized classrooms and higher margin customized classrooms and the timing of the completion of large  higher margin customized contracts 
inflation during the past three years  the company has not been adversely affected by inflation  because it has been generally able to pass along to its customers increases in the costs of labor and materials 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
