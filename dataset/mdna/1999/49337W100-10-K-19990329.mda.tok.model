item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marketspan corporation d b a keyspan energy the company is the successor to long island lighting company lilco as a result of a transaction with the long island power authority lipa the lipa transaction and following the acquisition the keyspan acquisition of keyspan energy corporation kse 
both transactions occurred on may  see note to the consolidated financial statements  sale of lilco assets  acquisition of keyspan energy corporation and transfer of assets and liabilities to the company for additional information 
the company is a predominately intrastate public utility holding company exempt from most of the provisions of the public utility holding company act of  as amended 
further  subsequent to these events  the company changed its fiscal year end from march to december current period consolidated results of operations  therefore  are reported for the nine month transition period april  to december  the transition period 
the transition period consists of the following i the period april  through may   which reflects the results of lilco prior to the lipa transaction and keyspan acquisition  and ii the period may  through december   which represents the results of the fully consolidated company  which includes all kse acquired companies  keyspan gas east corporation d b a brooklyn union of long island brooklyn union of long island  which provides gas distribution services on long island and other subsidiaries providing services to lipa under various services agreements with lipa 
as required under purchase accounting rules  the results for periods prior to may  reflect results of lilco only  and do not include results of kse 
as discussed in more detail below  the transition period being reported is not comparable either in time frame or composition of the company s operations to any prior historical period 
the analysis that follows is an explanation of consolidated results of operations during the transition period and an explanation of results of operations applicable to the operations of lilco for the twelve month periods ended march  and and december  further  the results of operations reported herein are not indicative of future results or operating trends 
earnings consolidated results for the transition period reflected a loss of million  or per share 
during the transition period  the company incurred substantial non recurring charges associated with the lipa transaction 
these non recurring charges principally reflected the following taxes associated with the sale of assets the transferred assets to the company by lipa  the write off of certain regulatory assets that were no longer recoverable under the various lipa agreements  and other transaction costs incurred to consummate the lipa transaction 
these charges were partially offset by tax benefits relating to the deferred federal income taxes necessary to account for the difference between the carryover basis of the transferred assets for financial reporting purposes and the new increased tax basis  and tax benefits recognized on the funding of certain postretirement benefits 
these non recurring charges associated with the lipa transaction were million after tax  or per share 
further  during the transition period  the company also incurred special charges amounting to million after tax  or per share 
these items were i a million after tax  or per share  charge for an early retirement program implemented in december in which approximately employees participated  and ii a million after tax  or per share  charge associated with the write off of a customer billing system that was in development 
also  in december  the company made a million donation million after tax  or per share to establish the keyspan foundation  a not for profit philanthropic foundation that will make donations to local charitable community organizations 
earnings also reflected an after tax non cash impairment charge recorded in december of million  or per share  which represents the company s share of the impairment charge recorded by its gas exploration and production subsidiary  the houston exploration company thec  to recognize the effect of low wellhead prices on its valuation of proved gas reserves 
consolidated income available for common stock  excluding the non recurring and special charges discussed above  by reporting segment  for the transition period and for the twelve months ended march  and and december  is set forth in the following summary in thousands of dollars for the transition period for the twelve months ended prior to the subsequent to acquisition the acquisition total income loss available for common stock gas distribution       electric services       gas exploration and production   energy related investments   energy related services   other   total consolidated       the gas distribution segment consists of the brooklyn union gas company brooklyn union and brooklyn union of long island  the company s two gas distribution subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries provide natural gas to customers in the new york city boroughs of brooklyn  queens and staten island and the long island counties of nassau and suffolk and the rockaway peninsula of queens county  respectively 
gas distribution segment earnings  excluding special charges for the transition period  reflected the fact that gas utility customers received the benefit of synergy savings related rate reductions  authorized by the public service commission of the state of new york nypsc  before synergy savings could begin to be achieved through cost reduction measures 
the company expects that the effect of these rate reductions will begin to be offset in fiscal as synergy savings are realized through cost reduction measures  principally the early retirement program implemented in december most importantly  earnings for the transition period do not include earnings from heating season operations months of january through march when the company realizes the major portion of its gas related earnings 
the electric services segment consists of subsidiaries that i own and operate oil and gas fired generating facilities located on long island and deliver the power generated by these facilities to lipa  ii manage and operate lipa s transmission and distribution t d system  and iii manage lipa s fuel and electric purchases and any off system sales 
earnings for the electric services segment for the period may  through december   excluding special charges  reflected service fees under various service contracts with lipa 
the company s operating margins under such arrangements are lower than those experienced prior to the lipa transaction  reflecting the change in the nature of the company s electric services business 
earnings for electric services for the period april  through may  were positively impacted by a change in the method of recording the monthly rate moderation component rmc amortization 
as a result of this change  for the period april  through may   the company recorded million more of non cash rmc credits to income  or million after tax  than it would have under the previous method 
for a further discussion  see operating expenses 
the gas exploration and production segment consists of the company s equity interest in thec  an independent natural gas and oil exploration company with properties located in the gulf of mexico  texas  the arkoma basin of oklahoma and arkansas  south louisiana and west virginia 
earnings associated with gas exploration and production  excluding special charges  were significantly affected by low gas prices during the transition period and increased operating expenses due primarily to increased production activity 
see revenues gas exploration and production for further discussion 
the energy related investments segment primarily consists of the company s investment in the iroquois gas transmission system lp  investments in the premier transco pipeline and phoenix natural gas in northern ireland and investments in certain midstream natural gas assets in western canada owned jointly with gulf canada resources limited 
the company recently has increased its investment in the premier transco pipeline  a gas pipeline extending from scotland to northern ireland  from a interest to a interest 
in addition  the company has a interest in phoenix natural gas  which is expanding and refurbishing the gas distribution system that serves the city of belfast in northern ireland 
results from these investments reflect the start up nature of their operations  while results relating to the company s investment in the iroquois gas transmission system lp are consistent with management s expectations 
the company completed its acquisition of a interest in certain midstream natural gas assets in western canada in december  and therefore  earnings from this investment will begin to be realized in see liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
results also reflected costs of approximately million after tax to settle certain contracts associated with the sale of the company s domestic cogeneration investments and fuel management operations  which took place in the company s energy related services segment primarily includes keyspan energy management inc kem  keyspan energy services inc 
kes and keyspan energy solutions  llc kesol 
kem provides a variety of technical and maintenance services to customers that operate commercial and industrial facilities located primarily within the new york city metropolitan area 
results from operations of kem were profitable during the transition period and reflected the continued integration of companies acquired during the past two years 
kes markets gas and electricity  and arranges transportation and related services  largely to retail customers  including those served by the company s two gas distribution subsidiaries 
kes incurred losses related to the start up nature of its operations during the transition period 
results from operations of kesol  which provides appliance repair service to residential customers primarily within the company s service territory  were also unprofitable during the transition period 
the company will continue to realign these non utility operations to maximize earnings potential  and where appropriate  possibly discontinue non profitable activities 
results reflected in the other segment  excluding special charges  include interest income earned on investments from the proceeds of the lipa transaction  offset  in part  by costs incurred by the corporate and administrative areas of the company that have not been allocated to the various business segments 
gas distribution results were affected by warmer than normal weather for the twelve months ended march  and gas distribution results for the year ended december  were positively affected by colder than normal weather  a rate increase which became effective december  and increased off system sales 
results from electric operations for the year ended march  were positively affected by the change in the method of amortizing the rmc to eliminate the effects of seasonality on monthly operating income see operating expenses for additional details on the rmc 
earnings for the twelve months ended march  and for the year ended december  were favorably affected by the benefits derived from increased investment in electric plants  continued efforts to reduce operations and maintenance expenses and the use of cash generated by operations to retire maturing debt 
revenues set forth below are the company s revenues for the transition period and for the twelve months ended march  and and december  in thousands of dollars for the transition period for the twelve months ended prior to the subsequent to acquisition the acquisition total operating revenues gas distribution       gas exploration and   production electric services   electric distribution      other   gas distribution gas distribution revenues for the transition period were impacted by rate reductions which were reflected at the time of the keyspan acquisition 
brooklyn union reduced rates to its core customers by million on an annual basis effective may  and brooklyn union of long island reduced its rates to core customers by million annually effective february  and by an additional million annually effective may  gas distribution revenues for the transition period do not include revenues from heating season operations january through march 
in addition  revenues of brooklyn union are not reflected for periods prior to the keyspan acquisition 
the effects of weather on gas distribution revenues are largely mitigated by the weather normalization adjustment included in the tariffs of both gas distribution utilities 
the weather normalization adjustment contained in brooklyn union s tariff provides for the company to retain or absorb of differences between actual margin revenues and margin revenues that would be produced under normal weather conditions 
the weather normalization adjustment contained in brooklyn union of long island s tariff requires the company to retain or absorb variations in margin revenues to the extent that actual heating degree days experienced during a billing cycle vary from normal heating degree days for that cycle by 
gas distribution revenues for the twelve months ended march  and and december  reflected the continued growth in the number of gas heating customers in all periods 
however  gas distribution revenues for the twelve months ended march  and were affected by warmer than normal weather during both periods 
revenues for the twelve months ended december  reflected the effects of colder than normal weather during that time period as well as the growth in the number of gas heating customers 
gas distribution revenues for the twelve months ended december  also reflected a gas rate increase that became effective on december  gas exploration and production gas exploration and production revenues reflected the continued development of natural gas properties acquired by thec during the past three years 
the benefits derived from increased production levels  however  were offset by decreases in average realized prices 
in  production was approximately billion cubic feet bcfe  or bcfe above the level of production for in  wellhead prices averaged approximately per mcf compared with per mcf in the effective price realized average wellhead price received for production including recognized hedging gains and losses was per mcf in compared with per mcf in electric services revenues for the transition period are derived from service agreements with lipa for the period may  through december  prior to the lipa transaction  lilco provided fully integrated electric service to its customers 
included within rates charged to customers was the return on the capital investment in the generation and t d assets  as well as recovery of the electric business costs to operate the system 
upon completion of the lipa transaction  the nature of the company s electric business has changed from that of owner of an electric generation and t d system  with significant capital investment  to a new role as owner of the non nuclear generation facilities and as manager of the t d system now owned by lipa 
in its new role  the company s capital investment is significantly reduced and accordingly  its revenues under the lipa contracts reflect that reduction 
revenues after may  reflect the impact of the lipa agreements which contribute marginally to earnings 
revenues realized under the management services agreement msa were million for the period may  through december  these revenues were derived from the performance of the day to day operation and maintenance of lipa s t d system  management of construction additions to the t d system  and the management of lipa s interest in the nine mile point nuclear power station  unit nmp 
revenues under the power supply agreement psa  including incentives earned  were million for the period may  through december  and were derived from the sale of capacity and energy to lipa from the company s generating facilities at rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission 
revenues under the energy management agreement ema  including incentives earned  were million for the period may  through december  and resulted from the management of fuel supplies for lipa to fuel the company s generating facilities and the management of energy purchases on a least cost basis to meet lipa s needs 
see electric services lipa agreements for a more detailed description of each of these agreements 
electric distribution electric revenues for the period april  through may  fluctuated mainly as a result of system growth  and variations in weather and fuel costs 
however  these variations had no impact on earnings due to the electric rate structure in effect at that time  which included a revenue reconciliation mechanism to eliminate the impact on earnings caused by sales volumes that were above or below adjudicated levels 
base electric rates were unchanged since december other revenues other revenues for the transition period primarily included revenues of the company s energy management subsidiary  kem  and the company s marketing subsidiary  kes 
kem provides a variety of services in all facets of energy management services to customers that operate commercial and industrial facilities  primarily within the new york city metropolitan area 
revenues have been enhanced through the continued integration of an engineering firm  and heating  ventilation and air conditioning companies purchased during the past two years 
kes markets gas and electricity  and arranges transportation and related services  largely to retail customers  and has been expanding its customer base 
operating expenses gas purchased variations in gas costs have little impact on operating results as the current gas rate structure of each of the company s two gas distribution utilities include a gas adjustment clause pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs and gas cost recoveries are deferred and subsequently refunded to  or collected from customers 
the cost of gas for the transition period was million  reflecting the inclusion of gas costs for kse subsequent to may   offset  in part  by warmer than normal weather and the fact that the transition period covers only nine months 
the cost of gas for the twelve months ended march  and was million and million  respectively  and reflected warmer than normal weather in both periods 
the cost of gas for the year ended december  was million and reflected colder than normal weather during that time period 
the average cost of gas has decreased in as compared to increases in and fuel and purchased power electric fuel expense for the period april  through may  was million 
in accordance with the ema  lipa is responsible for paying directly the costs of fuel and purchased power and  as a result  the company  since may   no longer incurs any electric fuel expense 
electric fuel expenses for the twelve months ended march  and and december  were million  million and million  respectively 
electric fuel expense in all periods reflected growing system sales quantities in each period and increased cost of fuel and purchased power each year 
variations in fuel and purchased power costs had little impact on operating results during these periods as lilco s electric rate structure included a mechanism that provided for the recovery or refund of actual fuel costs which varied from the level collected in rates 
operations and maintenance expense operations and maintenance expense for the transition period was million and included million of costs associated with the write off of a customer billing system that was in development 
additionally  in december the company completed an early retirement program in which approximately employees elected early retirement and a related expense of million was charged to operations 
moreover  for the transition period  operations and maintenance expense included the costs associated with the management of the t d assets acquired by lipa 
prior to the lipa transaction  all t d related capital costs were capitalized and charged to depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
since the lipa transaction  all t d related costs are expensed when incurred and recovered from lipa through monthly billings 
operation and maintenance expense for the twelve months ended march  and and december  was million  million and million  respectively 
reflected in all periods were the on going cost containment programs implemented by lilco which resulted in reductions to maintenance  distribution  and administrative and general expenses 
however  for the twelve months ended march   operation and maintenance expense also reflected the recognition of higher performance based employee incentives and certain other charges for employee benefits 
electric regulatory amortizations prior to the lipa transaction  the rmc included within electric regulatory amortizations represented the difference between lilco s revenue requirements under conventional ratemaking and the revenues provided by its electric rate structure 
the rmc was adjusted for the operation of the fuel moderation component fmc mechanism and the difference between lilco s share of actual operating costs at nmp and amounts provided for in electric rates 
in april  the nypsc authorized a revision  effective december   to lilco s method of recording its monthly rmc amortization from a straight line levelized basis over lilco s rate year  to a monthly amortization based upon each month s forecasted revenue requirement  which more closely aligned such amortization with lilco s cost of service 
as a result of this change  for the period april  through may   lilco recorded million more of non cash rmc credits to income representing accretion of the rmc balance  or million after tax  than it would have under the previous method 
in addition  for the year ended march   lilco recorded approximately million more of non cash rmc credits to income  or million after tax  than it would have under the previous method 
in connection with the lipa transaction  which included the sale of electric related regulatory assets  the rmc and all other electric regulatory amortizations were discontinued 
had the rmc amortization continued  the total rmc amortization for the rate year ended november   would have been equal to the amount that would have been provided for under the previous method 
other operating expenses depreciation and depletion expense reflected gas utility property and electric generation property additions for all periods and electric t d property additions for the periods prior to the lipa transaction 
in addition  for the period may  through december   depreciation and depletion expense reflected the gas production activities of the company s gas exploration and production subsidiary 
this subsidiary recorded an impairment charge of million in december to reduce the value of its proved gas reserves in accordance with the asset ceiling test limitations of the securities and exchange commission applicable to gas exploration and development operations accounted for under the full cost method 
offsetting these increases is the effect on depreciation expense from the sale of t d assets and nuclear generation assets to lipa 
operating taxes principally included state and local taxes on utility revenues and property 
the applicable property base and tax rates generally have increased in all periods 
however  significant property related assets were sold to lipa as part of the lipa transaction and  as a result  subsequent to may   property taxes on the sold assets are no longer incurred by the company 
for the twelve months ended march   operating taxes reflected the expiration of a temporary corporate surcharge on revenues previously imposed by new york state 
federal income tax expense in all years reflected changes in pre tax income 
pre tax income and the related federal income tax expense for the transition period were significantly affected by the write off of a customer billing system  charges related to the early retirement program  charges related to the lipa transaction  and the write down of proved gas reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  federal income tax 
other income and deductions other income and deductions for the transition period primarily reflected the non recurring charges associated with the lipa transaction of million after tax and a million after tax charge for the funding of the keyspan foundation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  costs related to the lipa transaction and special charges 
these charges were offset  in part  by earnings of million from the investment of the proceeds from the lipa transaction and earnings from the company s equity investment in the iroquois gas transmission system lp 
other income and deductions for the twelve months ended march  primarily included a charge of million with respect to certain benefits earned by former officers of lilco offset by carrying charges on certain of the company s electric regulatory assets resulting from electric ratemaking mechanisms 
other income and deductions for the year ended december  consisted primarily of non cash carrying charge income associated with regulatory assets 
interest expense as part of the lipa transaction  lipa has assumed substantially all of the outstanding debt of lilco 
the company  in connection with the lipa transaction  issued promissory notes to lipa for its continuing obligation to pay principal and interest on certain series of debt that has been assumed by lipa 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  long term debt  for additional information 
interest expense of million for the transition period reflected the significantly reduced level of outstanding debt resulting from the lipa transaction 
interest expense for the twelve months ended march  and was million and million  respectively 
interest expense in both periods reflected the lower outstanding debt level resulting from the retirement of million of indebtness in february for the twelve months ended december   interest expense was million reflecting increased letter of credit and commitment fees associated with a change in lilco s credit rating in liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   the company had cash and temporary cash investments of million 
effective january   the company has available unsecured bank lines of credit of million 
in addition  thec also has an available line of credit of million with a commercial bank

this line of credit applied jointly to kse and brooklyn union 
effective december   this line of credit terminated 
there were no outstanding borrowings on this line from may  through december  as a result of the lipa transaction  the company has a significant amount of cash which it has used and intends to continue to use for  among other things  the repurchase of shares of its common stock on the open market as discussed in greater detail below and the expansion of its operations through one or more of the following types of transactions mergers with or acquisitions of other utilities  investments in new gas pipelines and related assets such as storage fields and processing plants and gas exploration  or the purchase and or construction of additional electric power plants 
however  no assurance can be given that any of the foregoing types of transactions will occur or that such transactions  if completed  will be integrated with the company s operations or prove to be profitable 
in august  the company announced that the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to percent of the company s outstanding common stock  or approximately million shares  through open market purchases

adequate reserves for the payment of such taxes and interest were provided in prior fiscal years 
the negative cash flow from operating activities for the transition period is due primarily to the fact that significant positive cash flows that arise from revenues generated during a heating season have not been reflected in the transition period 
approximately of total annual gas revenues are realized during the heating season november to april as a result of the large proportion of heating sales  primarily residential  compared to total sales 
moreover  during the transition period  the company funded an additional million into voluntary employee s beneficiary association trusts see note to the consolidated financial statements  postretirement benefits 
annual cash flow from core utility operations has remained strong and should continue to provide the company with a substantial source of funds

in exchange for providing the services  the company will earn a million annual management fee and will be operating under an eight year contract which provides certain incentives and imposes certain penalties based upon its performance 
annual service incentives or penalties exist under the msa if certain targets are achieved or not achieved 
in addition  the company can earn certain incentives for cost reductions associated with the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of lipa s t d system 
these incentives provide for the company to i retain of cost reductions on the first million in reductions  and ii retain of additional cost reductions up to of the total cost budget  thereafter all savings will accrue to lipa 
with respect to cost overruns  the company will absorb the first million of overruns  with a sharing of overruns above million 
there are certain limitations on the amount of cost sharing of overruns 
to date  the company has performed its obligations under the msa within the agreed to budget guidelines and the company is committed to providing on going services to lipa within the established cost structure 
however  no assurances can be given as to future operating results under this agreement 
power supply agreement psa a company subsidiary sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy from the company s existing oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy are made with rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the rates may be modified in the future in accordance with the terms of the psa for i agreed upon labor and expense indices applied to the base year  ii a return of and on net capital additions required for the generating facilities  and iii reasonably incurred expenses that are outside the control of the company 
rates charged to lipa include a fixed and variable component 
the variable component is billed to lipa on a monthly basis and is dependent on the amount of megawatt hours dispatched 
lipa has no obligation to purchase energy from the company and is able to purchase energy on a least cost basis from all available sources consistent with existing interconnection limitations of the t d system 
the company must  therefore  operate its generating facilities in a manner such that the company can remain competitive with other producers of energy 
to date  the company has dispatched to lipa and lipa has accepted the level of energy generated at the agreed to price per megawatt hour 
however  no assurances can be given as to the level and price of energy to be dispatched to lipa in the future 
the psa provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for the maintenance of the output capability of the generating facilities 
the psa runs for a term of fifteen years 
in addition  three years after the lipa transaction is consummated  lipa will have the right for a one year period to acquire all of the company s generating assets included in the psa at the fair market value at the time of the exercise of the right  which value will be determined by independent appraisers 
energy management agreement ema the ema provides for a company subsidiary to procure and manage fuel supplies for lipa to fuel the generating facilities under contract to it and perform off system capacity and energy purchases on a least cost basis to meet lipa s needs 
in exchange for these services the company earns an annual fee of million 
in addition  the company will arrange for off system sales on behalf of lipa of excess output from the generating facilities and other power supplies either owned or under contract to lipa 
lipa is entitled to two thirds of the profit from any off system energy sales 
in addition  the ema provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for performance related to fuel purchases and off system power purchases 
the ema covers a period of fifteen years for the procurement of fuel supplies and covers a period of eight years for off system management services 
environmental the company will be required to complete the investigation and undertake an appropriate level of remediation at manufactured gas plant mgp sites formerly operated by brooklyn union or its predecessors and lilco or its predecessors 
with respect to the brooklyn union mgp sites  the company has recently completed a focused feasibility study ffs for the brooklyn borough works site in coney island in accordance with the terms of its administrative order on consent aco with the new york state department of environmental conservation dec 
the ffs identified remedial action alternatives consistent with potential future commercial re use of the property in the future  the company anticipates finalizing and implementing its choice of a remedial action alternative in the near future 
at the clifton site in staten island  the company is in the early stage of its investigation pursuant to its aco 
with respect to the citizens site  the company is waiting for a response from the city of new york regarding a cost sharing agreement for the investigation of that site  although there is no current legal obligation to address this site  the company anticipates that a site investigation will likely be undertaken in the future 
although the company has identified other former brooklyn union mgp sites to governmental authorities  based upon current information  the company does not believe that an obligation to investigate and or remediate these properties is likely 
with respect to six of the former lilco mgp sites  it is anticipated that two aco s with the new york dec will be finalized in the near future 
these aco s will establish an obligation to investigate and remediate these six properties 
after the execution of the aco for these six sites  the company anticipates that it will enter into further negotiations with the dec with respect to the preliminary investigation of other former lilco mgp sites not currently owned by the company 
although it is likely that such a preliminary investigation will be undertaken in the future  it is not currently known whether there will be an obligation to remediate any of these properties 
the company estimates the minimum cost of its mgp related environmental cleanup activities will be million and has recorded a related liability for such amount 
further  as of december   the company has expended million 
the company is awaiting final development of state and federal regulatory programs with respect to nox reduction requirements for its existing power plants 
the company s compliance strategy may be composed of fuel choice decisions  acquisition of pollution credits  and or installation of pollution control equipment 
although the company is currently considering its alternatives  final decisions cannot be made until the regulatory requirements are clarified 
expenditures to implement a final strategy are not expected to begin until additional capital expenditures associated with the renewal of the surface water discharge permits for the company s power plants may be required by the dec 
until the final permits are issued  the company cannot determine what the monitoring obligations will be  the results of any such monitoring  or the impact that any required equipment upgrades would have on company operations 
year issues the company has evaluated the extent to which modifications to its computer software  hardware and databases will be necessary to accommodate the year the company s computer applications are generally based on two digits and do require some additional programming to recognize the start of the new millennium 
system readiness a corporate wide program has been established to review company software  hardware  embedded systems and associated compliance plans 
the program includes both information technology it and non it systems 
non it systems are basically vendor supplied embedded systems that are critical to the daily operations of the company 
these systems are generally in the areas of electric production  distribution  transmission  gas distribution and communications 
the readiness of suppliers and vendor systems is also under review 
the project is under the direction of the year program office  chaired by the vice president  technology operations and corporate yk officer 
the critical areas of operations are being addressed through a business process review methodology 
each of the company s critical business processes is being reviewed to identify and inventory sub components  assess for year compliance  establish repair plans as necessary  and test in a year environment 
the inventory phase for both the it systems and non it systems is complete 
the total assessment phase is complete for the it systems  and as of december   over complete for non it systems 
hardware  software and embedded systems are being tested and certified to be year ready 
as of december   repair and testing was complete for the it systems and complete for the non it systems 
components needed to support the critical business processes and associated business contingency plans are expected to be year ready by july  vendors and business partners needed to support the critical business processes are also being reviewed for their year readiness 
at this time  none of these vendors have indicated to the company that they will be materially adversely affected by the year problem 
risk scenarios and contingency plans the company has analyzed each of the critical business processes to identify possible year risks 
each critical business process will be certified by the responsible corporate officer as being year ready 
however  the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios are also being identified 
business operating procedures are being reviewed to ensure that risks are minimized when entering the year and other high risk dates 
contingency plans are being developed to address possible failure points in each critical business process  and are scheduled to be completed by july while the company must plan for the following possible worst case scenarios  management believes that these events are improbable loss of gas pipeline delivery the company s gas utility subsidiaries receive gas delivery from multiple national and international pipelines and therefore the effects of a loss in any one pipeline can be mitigated through the use of other pipelines 
complete loss of all the supply lines is not considered a reasonable scenario 
nevertheless  the impact of the loss of any one pipeline is dependent on temperature and vaporization rate 
should gas supply be decreased due to the loss of a pipeline  each of the company s gas utility subsidiaries also has a local liquefied natural gas facility under its direct control that stores sufficient gas to offset the temporary loss of any one pipeline 
the partial loss of gas supply will not affect the company s ability to supply electricity since most of the plants have the ability to operate on oil 
loss of electric generation or electric transmission and distribution electric utilities are physically connected on a regional basis to manage electric load 
this is often referred to as the regional grid 
presently the company is working  on behalf of lipa  with other regional utilities to develop a coordinated operating plan 
should there be an instability in the grid  the company has the ability to remove lipa s facilities and operate independently 
certain electric system components such as individual generating units  t d control facilities  and the electric energy management system have the potential to be affected by the year problem 
the company has inventoried both its and lipa s electric system components and developed a plan to certify mission critical processes as year ready 
as manager of the t d facilities  the company is responsible for ensuring that these facilities operate properly and that related systems are year ready 
under the terms of the various lipa contracts  lipa will reimburse the company for certain year costs incurred by the company for these facilities 
contingency plans are being developed  where appropriate  for loss of critical system elements 
the company presently estimates that contingency plans regarding its electric facilities should be completed by july loss of telecommunications the company has a substantial dependency on many telecommunication systems and services for both internal and external communication providers 
external communications with the public and the ability of customers to contact the company in cases of emergency response is essential 
the company intends to coordinate its emergency response efforts with the offices of emergency management of the various local governments within its service territory 
internally  there are a number of critical processes in both the gas and electric operating areas that rely on external communication providers 
contingency plans will address methods for manually monitoring these functions and or utilizing alternative communication methods 
these contingency plans should be finalized by july in addition to the above  the company is also planning for the following scenarios short term reduction in system power generating capability  limitation to fuel oil operations  reduction in quality of power output  loss of automated meter reading  loss of ability to read customer meters  prepare bills and collect and process customer payments  and loss of the purchasing materials management system 
the company believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new hardware and software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed on time  and contingency plans fail  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company  the extent of which cannot currently be determined 
cost of remediation the company expects to spend a total of approximately million to address the year issue 
as of december   million had been expended on the project 
the largest percentage expended is attributable to the assessment  repair and testing of corporate it supported computer software and in house written applications  which total million 
in  the it year costs are expected to be of the it budget 
the year issue has not directly resulted in delaying any it projects 
presently  the company expects that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund the year project expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk the company and its subsidiaries are subject to various risk exposures and uncertainties associated with their operations 
the primary risk exposures are related to firm gas contracts  financial instruments  various regulatory initiatives of the nypsc and ferc  the increasingly competitive energy environment  and to a lesser extent foreign currency fluctuations 
set forth below is a description of these exposures and an explanation as to how the company and its subsidiaries have managed and  to the extent possible  sought to reduce these risks 
fixed charges under firm contracts the company s gas utility subsidiaries have entered into various long term contracts for gas delivery  storage and supply services in order to provide sufficient supply for their customers 
the contracts have remaining terms that cover from one to fourteen years 
certain of these contracts require payment of monthly charges demand charges in the aggregate amount of million per month in all events regardless of the level of service available 
at this time  the company s exposure is minimal since these charges are currently recovered as gas cost under the respective gas adjustment clauses contained in the tariffs of the company s gas utility subsidiaries 
the company does not expect rate regulation to change in the immediate future regarding recovery of demand charges  however  the company is unable to predict the evolution of rate regulation 
in addition  company subsidiaries have entered into agreements with enron corporation and coral energy resources  lp which provide for these companies to engage in overall gas supply management arrangements with and on behalf of the company 
derivative financial instruments the company s gas utility subsidiaries  marketing and gas exploration and production subsidiaries employ  from time to time  derivative financial instruments  such as natural gas and oil futures  options and swaps  for the purpose of hedging exposure to commodity price risk 
at december   the value at risk of the related positions as measured by the maximum adverse price movement in a single day was not material 
whenever hedge positions are in effect  the company s subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to derivative contracts  as well as nonperformance by the counter parties of the transactions against which they are hedged 
the company believes that the credit risk related to the futures  options and swap instruments is no greater than that associated with the primary commodity contracts which they hedge  as the instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions  and that reduction of the exposure to price risk lowers the company s overall business risk 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  financial instruments and contingencies 
regulatory issues and the competitive environment the energy industry continues to undergo fundamental changes as regulators  elected officials and customers seek lower energy prices 
these changes  which may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of utilities  are being driven by a number of factors including a regulatory environment in which traditional cost based regulation is seen as a barrier to lower energy prices 
over the past few years  the nypsc has been formulating a policy framework to guide the transition of new york state s gas distribution industry in the deregulated gas industry environment 
since  customers in the small volume market have been given the option to purchase their gas supplies from sources other than the company s two gas utility subsidiaries 
large volume customers have had this option for a number of years 
in addition to transporting gas that customers purchase from marketers  the company s utilities have been providing billing  meter reading and other services for aggregate rates that match the distribution charge reflected in otherwise applicable sales rates to supply these customers 
in november  the nypsc issued a policy statement setting forth its vision for furthering competition in the natural gas industry 
under this vision  regulated natural gas utilities or local distribution companies ldc s would plan to exit the business of purchasing gas for and selling gas to customers the merchant function over the next three to seven years 
ldc s would remain the operators of the gas system the distribution function and the provider of last resort of natural gas supplies during that period and until alternatives are developed 
the nypsc s goal is to encourage more competition at the local level by separating the merchant function from the distribution function 
the nypsc has acknowledged that each utility has operating circumstances unique to its service territory and therefore separation of the merchant and distributions functions should be done on a utility by utility basis 
with this in mind  the nypsc will institute individual proceedings for each regulated natural gas utility so that the parties can determine the most effective means of achieving the nypsc s goals 
in addition  the nypsc will also institute generic proceedings to examine reliability and other issues 
the company conceptually supports the vision articulated in the policy statement 
however  in the company s view  any transition to a new industry structure must adequately address a number of unresolved issues to ensure that separating the merchant and distribution functions is in the best interest of natural gas customers and is equitable to ldc s 
such issues include system reliability  recovery of prudently incurred costs  the obligation to provide service to all firm customers  tax disparity among suppliers  administrative overheads  customer acceptance and the obligation to be supplier of last resort 
further  the company will also pursue legislative changes where needed 
the company currently is not able to determine what effect these changes  if implemented  may have on its operations 
foreign currency fluctuations the company follows the principles of sfas no 
 foreign currency translation for recording its investments in foreign affiliates 
at december   the foreign currency translation adjustment was immaterial 
however  due to the company s recent purchase of certain canadian interests and its continued and possibly expanded activities internationally  foreign currency translation adjustments in the future could become material  the magnitude of which cannot be predicted at this time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies
