customer deposits for home and sunroom orders and cash from operations are the company s primary sources of cash 
traditionally  operations have been the primary source of funds for working capital as well as expansion and facilities acquisitions

interest paid on the tax exempt industrial revenue bonds is tax free to the bondholders and provides preferential interest rates to the company 
the principal of the taxable bonds matures in approximately equal amounts between and  with the principal of the tax exempt bonds maturing between and in   of taxable industrial revenue bonds matured 
bond principal taxable and tax exempt matures on an annual basis in amounts which  when combined with interest on the outstanding principal  results in approximately equal annual cash payments of principal and interest 
under the terms of the loan agreement between the company and the washington economic development finance authority  the company is required to maintain an irrevocable letter of credit 
to secure the letter of credit  the company pledged property  with an aggregate book value at december  of million  as collateral

the central puget sound regional transit authority  a governmental agency  has notified the company that the site occupied by the company s head office  display court and adjacent business park  in seattle  washington  has been identified as the preferred site for the location of a light rail maintenance base 
management is working with the central puget sound regional transit authority to more fully understand and mitigate the potential impact of this site selection on the company s operations 
currently  management can not adequately determine the extent of the potential impact 
however  it is expected that designation as the preferred site will have a negative impact on the company s ability to renew business park leases that expire in the central puget sound regional transit authority is expected to make its final site selection some time in in the event that the central puget sound regional transit authority chooses the company s property as its final site selection for the maintenance base  management believes that the company will receive fair market value for the property surrendered 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

this statement is effective for financial statements for years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
year the year problem is the result of computer programs and hardware being developed that utilizes two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the consequences of this issue may include failure of information technology systems and interruption of business processes 
the problem exists for many kinds of hardware and software 
any system  used by the company  its dealers or vendors  that have time sensitive software or hardware may recognize a date using as rather than the year the year issues affects the company s internal systems  including information technology it and non it systems such as its integrated manufacturing and accounting system  computer operating systems  voice and electronic communication systems  server and pc software and hardware  drafting systems  database systems and other software and hardware based systems 
the company is still in the process of completing an assessment of the readiness of its internal systems for handling the year however  the assessment of the company s integrated manufacturing system  its core business system  has been completed and the software has been upgraded to a year certified compliant version 
internal testing of the upgraded software is scheduled for the spring of the company s assessment of other  less vital internal systems in ongoing 
those remaining it and non it systems that are not year ready will either be upgraded to year compliant versions of the same software or hardware  or new year compliant software and or hardware will be acquired and implemented 
management currently believes that the internal assessment will be completed and remediation steps identified by the end of the first quarter of management expects that the remediation process will be completed by the end of the second quarter of and final testing will be completed in the fourth quarter of management believes all material internal systems will be compliant by the year and that the cost to address the issue will not be material 
nevertheless  the company will create contingency plans for certain internal systems  as year compliance can not be definitively determined 
all organizations must assess the effect the year issue will have on their third party supply chain 
the company has identified its key vendors and is surveying key third parties to understand their ability to continue providing services and products through the change to year the company will create contingency plans for these key vendors 
the company is continuing its assessment of other third party vendors and will develop contingency plans that include the identification of alternate suppliers 
management currently expects that the assessment of third party vendors will be completed in the third quarter of and that its contingency plans will be completed in the fourth quarter of the company is also working with its dealers to determine their ability to sell the company s products through the year the company will partner with them if necessary  to avoid any business interruptions in until the company completes its internal  vendor and dealer assessments  it can not determine its most likely  worst case  year scenario  nor adequately describe appropriate contingency plans 
any software or hardware costs involved with year remediation will either be charged to expense as incurred or capitalized  depending on the circumstances of each case 
internal staff costs involved in year issues will not be incremental  but rather represent the re deployment of existing resources 
such internal staff costs will be expensed as incurred 
unamortized capital costs of previously acquired software and hardware will be accelerated over the estimated period of utility and any remaining unamortized capital costs at the date the hardware or software is abandoned due to year issues will be written off 
management believes that the costs related to the year issue will not be material 
results of operations years ended december  and general overall  company operations improved considerably in while home sales revenues were down from levels  primarily due to market resistance of the price increases implemented in and  the company successfully implemented several new programs 
in january  the company introduced the new select product line  which was test marketed in while market response will take time to develop  management believes this new product will increase sales on a long term basis 
the company also implemented design and specification changes that will lower the final constructed cost of its existing line of homes  which management believes will also benefit sales volume on a long term basis 
management negotiated the sale of its surrey  british columbia sawmill in exchange for a conditional long term guaranteed cedar supply agreement 
management believes this will benefit the company by securing a supply of cedar at market prices  possibly more favorable than the cost of producing the cedar lumber internally 
management also established a new joint venture agreement for the planning  management of harvesting  and marketing of logs from its second timber sale 
management implemented programs to increase the timeliness and accuracy of its services and distribution systems 
management implemented an aggressive cost containment program that drove down manufacturing and operating costs from levels

the access home the base price of which is less than the traditional cedar frame product accounted for of home sales revenue and of home units shipped in compared to of home sales revenue and of home units shipped in management believes the decrease in home units shipped and home dollar sales volume is primarily due to the cumulative effect of prices increases implemented in and to partially offset the elevated material prices experienced in late  and early during  the company announced one price increase that became fully effective in the third quarter of all other revenue sources  primarily material sales  decreased million to million in from million in this is primarily due to decreased sales of green cedar lumber and chips which resulted from the closure in and the sale in of the company s sawmill 
the sawmill operated for approximately a three week period in compared to approximately months in since most of the sawmill output is sold on the open lumber market  there was less lumber and chips sold during than in material costs in general  the company continues to experience elevated costs for lumber and wood products  especially for cedar  the primary material used in the company s homes over historic levels

as a percent of revenue  material costs decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in material costs peaked in the fourth quarter of at of revenue 
the decrease in material costs as a percentage of revenue is due to softening of wood costs  decreased lumber sales and the cumulative effect of the price increases implemented in and overall  the elevated material costs have been partially offset by the price increases 
material costs decreased million to million in from million in on fewer home shipments and  due to the closure and sale of the sawmill  a decrease in the amount of cedar lumber sold 
since most of the sawmill output is sold on the open lumber market  there was less lumber sold during than in other costs of good sold non material costs included in the cost of goods sold decreased million to million in from million in this is largely due to the cost reductions related to closure of the sawmill and the classification of certain sawmill holding costs as operating expenses  which reduced non material cost of goods sold by million 
in addition  plant labor  plant supervision and related expenses decreased an additional  from levels primarily due to the reduced volume of sales and the company s cost containment program 
customer service costs decreased   while other changes in non material costs of goods sold totaled a net decrease of  from year ago levels 
the decrease in customer service costs reflects the improved efficiency in the company s operational performance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are commodity lumber prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company  from time to time  enters into futures contracts to hedge future purchases of specific types and grades of non cedar lumber with the objective of reducing risk due to market fluctuations 
the aggregate commitment underlying the company s futures contracts and deferred losses from hedged lumber were not material at december  such losses in fair value  if realized  would be reduced by lower costs of the lumber purchased at market value 
the company is subject to foreign currency exchange rate exposure  primarily related to canadian operations and the sale of homes to canadian customers 
historically  this exposure has had a minimal impact on the company 
home sales into countries other than canada are made in us dollars 
at the present time  the company does not hedge foreign currency risk  but may hedge known transaction exposure in the future 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates is minimal 
interest on short term investments of less than days is based on market interest rates 
at december   the company s investment in fixed rate instruments was not material 
all of the company s long term debt is fixed rate 
the company s line of credit is based on the prime rate 
at december   the company had no amounts owing on the line of credit
