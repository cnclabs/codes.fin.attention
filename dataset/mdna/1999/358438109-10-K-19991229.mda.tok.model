item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as used herein  the terms fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal refer to the company s fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for fiscal  the company changed its accounting policy relating to revenue recognition for diamond and gold bond product warranties 
the company concluded that revenue from the sale of diamond and gold bond product warranties should be deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated life of the contracts 
the financial statements for fiscal and fiscal have been restated and the discussion that follows reflects the effect of this change 
also  the company restated its financial statements for the fiscal years ended september  and to reflect this change 
in addition  the company has changed the presentation of its statement of income 
certain balances as of september  through september   have been reclassified to conform to the current year income statement presentation and also conform to retail industry financial reporting practices 
specifically  the company has reclassified finance charge income and insurance commissions  previously included in revenues  as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reclassified the provision for doubtful accounts to selling  general and administrative expenses  netting this expense against the finance charge and insurance commission income discussed above 
the company has also reclassified certain inventory related expenses from selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of goods sold 
these expenses include inventory shortages and related accruals  outbound freight and inventory capitalization costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain percentage relationships based on the company s consolidated income statements for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended september  net sales cost of goods sold including occupancy  distribution and buying selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization interest income expense income before extraordinary item and income taxes income tax expense net income selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal include a million charge related to reserves established for senior executive severance and store closing costs and a charge for the accelerated write off of specific accounts aggregating million associated with the company s change in its credit policy  effective september  excluding these charges  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended september   from million in the fiscal year ended september  of the million increase in net sales  million  or of the increase resulted from additional net sales contributions from net new stores and million  or of the increase came from increases in comparable store net sales in fiscal comparable store net merchandise sales increased in the fiscal year ended september  cost of goods sold  including occupancy  distribution and buying  increased to million  or  of net sales  for fiscal versus million  or  of net sales  in fiscal the fiscal increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher merchandise cost of goods offset slightly by lower store occupancy costs 
the increase in merchandise cost of goods was primarily due to a higher sales of advertised  promotional and clearance merchandise and a change in sales mix from gold to diamond products which traditionally result in lower gross margins 
in general  cost of goods as a percentage of net sales may continue to increase as a result of the company s merchandising and promotional activities  but management does not believe that such potential increases represent a material continuing trend 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal included a million charge related to reserves established for senior executive severance and store closing costs and a million charge related to a change in the company s credit policy to accelerate the write off of all accounts contractually past due if no payments have been received for days 
excluding these charges  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was primarily due to improved expense leverage in payroll  advertising and other direct expenses resulting from the increase in comparable store net merchandise sales and productivity gains from an increase in the number of stores in existing markets 
the company does not expect the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to constitute a continuing material trend 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to expenses associated with the implementation of new computer software placed into service july  in general  depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of net sales may continue to increase as a result of additional investments in systems and infrastructure 
interest income from a related party decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  interest income from a related party decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal management expects interest income from a related party to continue to decrease because of repayment of borrowings by crescent jewelers inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  crescent jewelers collectively  crescent 
crescent is affiliated with the company because of common ownership and management 
this decrease will likely be partially offset by crescent s payments to the company of fees related to the company s guaranty of crescent s obligations under crescent s credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  interest expense remained unchanged at of net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings on the company s line of credit 
see liquidity and capital resources 
income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net income increased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of increases in net sales  lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales and a lower effective income tax rate 
the positive effect of those items on net income was partially offset by increases in cost of goods sold  depreciation and amortization expense and net interest expense 
basic and diluted earnings per share increased to in fiscal from in fiscal basic weighted average common shares outstanding decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal diluted weighted average shares outstanding including common stock equivalents decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended september   from million in the fiscal year ended september  of the million increase in net sales  million  or of the increase resulted from additional net sales contributions from net new stores offset by a decrease of million  or 
from comparable store net sales in fiscal comparable store net merchandise sales decreased in the fiscal year ended september  cost of goods sold  including occupancy  distribution and buying  increased to million  or  of net sales  for fiscal versus million  or  of net sales  in fiscal the fiscal increase as a percentage of net sales was the result of higher store occupancy costs primarily due to the addition of a higher percentage of new mall stores in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal included a million charge related to reserves established for senior executive severance and store closing costs and a million charge related to a change in the company s credit policy to accelerate the write off of all accounts contractually past due if no payments have been received for days 
the severance was accrued when the executives terminated employment and the amount of severance to be paid to each executive was established 
the store closing costs were recognized when the company made the decision to close the stores 
the company actually closed the stores soon thereafter 
excluding these charges  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal in january  the company appointed a new president chief operating officer and a new vice chairman chief executive officer 
these executives resigned their positions with the company in june and september  respectively 
the direct and indirect expenses incurred with the employment and subsequent termination of these executives significantly impacted selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal was also due to reduced expense leverage associated with the reduction in comparable store sales and a general increase in most operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal net interest expense was million in fiscal compared to net interest income of million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  net interest expense was in fiscal compared to net interest income of in fiscal the fiscal increase in net interest expense was due primarily to higher outstanding borrowings on the company s line of credit due primarily to the increase in the net investment in inventory 
see liquidity and capital resources 
income tax expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate remained at in fiscal net income decreased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of increases in cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense 
the negative effect of those items on net income was partially offset by increased net sales volume 
basic earnings per share decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal on basic weighted average shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal on diluted weighted average shares including common stock equivalents of  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  net cash provided by the company s operating activities was million compared to net cash used in operating activities of million and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  cash provided by operations was favorably impacted by improved earnings and lower net inventory levels  including accounts payable  offset slightly by increases in customer accounts receivables 
for fiscal and  despite the company s ability to generate net income in both fiscal years  the company continued to use cash in its operations 
cash used in operations was the result of the growth in accounts receivable and inventories  both principally from the net addition of stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal cash used in operations was also affected by a decrease in accounts payable in fiscal compared to increases in accounts payable in fiscal and to the extent that the company continues to expand rapidly  it will continue to experience significant increases in credit sales and related increases in customer accounts as well as increases in inventories  which will likely result in a net use of cash from operations 
investing activities provided cash of million in fiscal  compared to a use of cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the company added net new stores in fiscal at a cost of approximately million 
additionally  at a cost of million  the company implemented a new enterprise wide computer system that was placed into service july  the company spent million in and million in fiscal for the net addition of and stores  respectively 
during fiscal  the company was repaid the million it had invested in crescent 
the company made this investment in august part of the investment was in the form of a million convertible senior subordinated secured loan the term loan and a million senior subordinated convertible note the notes issued by crescent pursuant to a previously entered into standby purchase commitment 
during fiscal  the company also issued loans  maturing in and amounting to million to certain directors  officers and employees of the company to purchase shares of the class a common stock of the company 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal compared to providing cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  the company repaid bank borrowings of million 
during fiscal and  the company had bank borrowings of million and million  respectively 
at september   the company had million available under its million senior secured revolving credit facility 
on september   the company entered into a three year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either the federal funds rate plus  the prime rate or  at the company s option  the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin ranging from to 
the applicable margin is determined based on a calculation of the combined leverage ratio of the company and crescent 
the facility contains certain financial covenants and is secured by certain of the company s assets 
the company used the proceeds from the credit facility together with the proceeds from the repayment of its million investment in crescent to repay in full all of its obligations under its then existing credit facilities 
at september   million was outstanding under the new facility  with interest accruing on such borrowings in a range from to 
although borrowings under the new facility bear interest at rates that are generally higher than the rates under the company s previous credit facility  which may increase interest expense  management does not believe that this will materially affect the company s results 
management believes that the company s credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s working capital requirements through fiscal in connection with the new credit facility  the company agreed to provide certain credit enhancements to and to guaranty the obligations of crescent under its million senior secured revolving credit facility 
in consideration for this guaranty  crescent will make quarterly payments to the company in an amount equal to per annum of the outstanding obligations of crescent under its credit facility during the preceding fiscal quarter 
in further consideration of this guaranty  crescent issued the company a warrant to purchase  shares of crescent s non voting class a common stock  or approximately of the capital stock of crescent on a fully diluted basis for an exercise price of  on may   the company acquired all the rights of aa friedman co  inc of augusta  georgia aafco to the friedman s jewelers tradename 
in connection with the tradename rights acquisition  the company issued aafco  shares in escrow of its class a common stock 
the company also agreed to pay aafco the amount by which the sales price of the stock at june   the escrow settlement date is less than 
prior to the sale of the shares  the company had agreed to make cash advance payments to aafco through an escrow arrangement  which would pre fund the minimum sale proceeds 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company had advanced million and million  respectively  to aafco under this agreement 
based on the market value of the  shares at the settlement date  june   no further amounts were due to aafco and the company retired the  shares held in escrow  finalizing the transaction 
the company s current plans are to have between and stores in operation for the christmas season 
to accomplish this goal  the company will have to open between and new stores 
the company currently anticipates that approximately of these new stores  or to stores  will be in power strip centers and or to stores  will be in regional malls 
the capital required to fund this expansion  principally to finance inventory  fixtures and leasehold improvements  is estimated to be million and is intended to be provided by cash flow from operations and the company s revolving credit facility 
seasonality the company has in the past experienced a well defined seasonality in its business with respect to both net sales and profitability 
generally  the company experiences substantially increased sales volume in the days preceding major holidays  including christmas  valentine s day and mother s day 
due to the impact of the christmas shopping season  the company experiences the strongest results of operations in the first quarter of its fiscal year 
the company does not expect the deferral of revenue under its changed accounting policy relating to the sales of diamond and gold bond product warranties to alter materially this trend 
if for any reason the company s sales were below those normally expected for the first quarter  the company s annual results could be materially adversely affected 
the seasonality of the company s business puts a significant demand on working capital resources to provide for an inventory buildup for the christmas season 
furthermore  the christmas season typically leads to a seasonal buildup of customer receivables that are paid down during subsequent months 
however  to the extent that the company s expansion program continues  it can be expected that increased levels of accounts receivable related to such expansion may affect the historical seasonal decline in customer receivables 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the prices of diamonds  gemstones and gold 
substantially all of the leases for the company s retail stores located in malls provide for contingent or volume related rental increases 
in prior years  the company has been able to adjust its selling prices to substantially recover increased costs 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
state of readiness the company currently operates under four principal information systems an accounting system that covers all financial information processes from the general ledger to the compilation of financial statements  a credit system operating primarily at the store level and supported by a centralized database  that provides the store with a method of analyzing  extending and collecting customer credit  a retail system that covers the company s inventory  merchandising and distribution management  and a point of sale system that operates primarily at the store level and facilitates product sales and gathers relevant sales information for transmittal to the company s accounting systems 
in  the company completed its assessment of each of these systems with the following results the accounting system required a software upgrade to the latest release of the current software package 
the upgrade and testing are complete and this system is compliant 
the credit system required modifications to the software programs that operate the system 
those modifications and testing are complete and this system is compliant 
the retail system required the installation of a new software package as well as a new hardware system to support it 
the software package has been installed and tested and has been determined to be compliant 
in addition  the company has completed the installation of additional hardware to support the new software package 
the point of sale system required a software upgrade as well as an upgrade of the personal computers in each store on which the software is operated 
the software and computer upgrades have been completed and the system is compliant 
costs to address year issues the company utilized both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software and hardware for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project was approximately million and has been funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  approximately million was attributable to the purchase of new software and hardware that was capitalized 
risks of year issues and contingency plans management believes that the company s primary risk from the year issues relates to third party vendor and business partner non compliance 
the company has identified all key third parties or business partners who are critical to the company s business and its operations 
the company has sent a year readiness exposure document to each of these vendors requesting that they confirm their year compliance 
of the vendors that did respond  all indicated that they would be in compliance by december  those who did not respond were contacted directly by the company and all confirmed their compliance 
based on the results of the analysis of the compliance efforts of the company s third party vendors and business partners  management believes that no significant risk of non compliance exists and  accordingly  has not created a contingency plan 
should the company s internal systems fail to function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter  the company believes that the decentralized nature of its store operations would allow it to continue to operate with limited interruption 
the primary effect of such a failure would be in the management of inventory levels in the stores  the extension of credit and the management of accounts receivable 
the company may not be able to track the sale of its products in the stores as quickly as it currently is able to  and  as a result  would not be able to replenish the inventory in a timely manner 
in addition  the stores credit systems may not operate properly  which could limit their ability to accurately assess the credit rating of potential customers and lead to lost sales as a result of credit denial or uncollectible accounts due to improper credit ratings 
also  any interruption in the company s credit systems could significantly and adversely affect the collection of accounts receivable 
following the completion of the steps outlined in state of readiness above  the company re assessed the risk that its internal operating systems will not be year compliant 
in management s opinion  no significant risk of non compliance exists with its internal operating systems 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information fas  which is effective for fiscal year fas establishes standards for the way that public companies report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those companies report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services and major customers 
the company has adopted the new requirements in fiscal the company operates in one segment  and  therefore  no additional disclosures are required 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
the company will be required to adopt the statement in its fiscal year ended september  the company does not employ any derivative instruments and  therefore  statement is presently not expected to have an effect on the company s financial statements 
factors affecting future performance dependence on ability to grow and manage growth the number of stores we operate has increased greatly during the past three years 
for example  we opened approximately net new stores from december to december in order to meet our business objectives  we will need to continue to expand our store base during fiscal the success of our expansion program will depend on the performance of our existing stores  our ability to find suitable store locations and our ability to hire and train qualified store personnel 
we anticipate that there will continue to be significant competition among specialty retailers for desirable store sites and qualified personnel 
furthermore  if our operations fail to generate sufficient cash flow  we may require additional capital to finance our planned expansion 
our growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on all aspects of our business  including our management information and distribution systems and personnel 
for these reasons  we may not be successful in continuing our growth or managing our growth 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fund our growth  manage costs  adapt our operating systems  respond to changing business conditions or otherwise achieve or accommodate growth

competition the retail jewelry business is mature and highly competitive 
our retail jewelry business competes with national and regional jewelry chains  as well as with local independently owned jewelry stores and chains 
we also compete with other types of retailers who sell jewelry and gift items  such as department stores  catalog showrooms  discounters  direct mail suppliers  television home shopping networks and jewelry retailers who make sales through internet sites 
our credit operations compete with credit card companies and other providers of consumer credit 
management believes that friedman s competes primarily on the basis of selection of merchandise offered  pricing  quality of sales personnel  advertising  ability to offer in house credit  store location and reputation 
many competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
we may not be able to compete successfully with such competitors 
competition could cause us to lose customers  increase expenditures or reduce pricing which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results 
see item business competition 
sensitivity to general economic conditions jewelry is a luxury item  not a necessity product 
as a result  sales of jewelry may be particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy  such as decreases in employment levels  wages and salaries 
historically  people spend less money on luxury items  such as jewelry  during a decline in general economic activity 
sales of our jewelry are also adversely affected by negative developments in local economic conditions  such as plant closings  industry slowdown and government employment cutbacks 
we also depend on customer traffic at the power strip centers and malls where our stores are located 
a reduction in consumer spending due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our results of operation or financial condition 
a majority of our customers use credit either from us or another consumer credit source to purchase jewelry from us 
when there are adverse trends in the general economy or increases in interest rates  fewer people use credit 
our credit operations are also affected by general economic trends 
any downturn in general or local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our ability to collect outstanding credit accounts receivable 
during fiscal  we wrote off of our accounts receivable as a percentage of credit revenues 
see item selected financial data and item business credit operations 
seasonality and fluctuation in quarterly results our first fiscal quarter which ends december has historically been the strongest quarter of the year in terms of net sales and operating income 
any substantial disruption of holiday season shopping or other events which affect our first quarter results could have a material adverse effect on our profitability for the whole year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the following the timing of new store openings  net sales contributed by new stores  actions of competitors  fluctuations in comparable store sales  timing of certain holidays  changes in our merchandise  and general economic  industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
dependence on key personnel our management and operations depend on the skills and experience of our senior management team  including our president and chief executive officer  bradley j 
stinn 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies depends on the continued employment of our senior management team 
the loss of mr 
stinn or a significant number of other senior officers could hurt us materially 
we do not have and do not contemplate entering into employment agreements with  or obtaining key man life insurance for  any senior officer 
potential effects of incentive compensation program on earnings in october  we made million in incentive loans to each of mr 
stinn and sterling b 
brinkley  our chairman of the board of directors 
the loans mature in we agreed to forgive principal and interest payments on these incentive loans if our class a common stock reached certain prices 
if we forgive principal and interest payments  we will incur compensation expense which reduces earnings 
during and  we incurred compensation expense of million with respect to the incentive loans 
if the price of the class a common stock increases above the remaining price targets  we will incur an additional million in compensation expense 
this compensation expense  if incurred  will negatively impact earnings 
fluctuations in comparable store sales results one widely used measure of the performance of a retail company like us is comparable store sales results 
variations in comparable store sales results could cause the price of the class a common stock to decrease or fluctuate substantially 
comparable store sales are affected by a variety of factors including local and general economic conditions  the retail sales environment  and our ability to execute our business strategy efficiently 
comparable store net merchandise sales increased in fiscal there can be no assurance that comparable store net merchandise sales will increase in any future period 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
availability and prices of merchandise we primarily sell jewelry made of gold and diamonds and  to a lesser extent  other precious and semi precious metals and stones 
the prices of these materials have been  and we expect for them to continue to be  subject to significant volatility 
further  the supply and price of diamonds are significantly influenced by a single entity  debeers consolidated mines ltd 
of south africa 
we do not maintain long term inventories or otherwise hedge against fluctuations in the cost of gold or diamonds 
a significant increase in the price of gold and diamonds could adversely affect our sales and gross margins 
see item business purchasing 
our supply of diamonds comes primarily from south africa  botswana  zaire  the former soviet republics and australia 
changes in the social  political or economic conditions in one or more of these countries could have an adverse effect on our supply of diamonds 
any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from these producing countries could adversely affect us and the retail jewelry industry as a whole

concentration of control of friedman s mr 
phillip e 
cohen controls all of our class b common stock through his ownership of ms jewelers  the general partner of the partnership which owns the class b common stock 
the holders of class b common stock elect of our directors and control the outcome of all other issues decided by our stockholders  including major corporate transactions 
mr 
cohen can transfer the class b common stock and its voting rights to a third party  subject to certain limitations 
if mr 
cohen were to convert the class b common stock into class a common stock  he would control approximately of the class a common stock 
limited voting rights of class a common stock holders of class a common stock have the right to elect a minimum of of our directors 
as long as there are shares of class b common stock outstanding  holders of class a common stock have no other voting rights  except as required by law 
mr 
cohen  through the partnership  controls the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders 
some potential investors may not like this concentration of control and the price of class a common stock may be adversely affected 
mr 
cohen s control of friedman s may also discourage offers by third parties to buy us or to merge with us 
further  the interests of mr 
cohen could conflict with the interests of the holders of class a common stock 
government regulation federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations limit the manner in which we may offer and extend credit and insurance 
any adverse change in the regulation of credit could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
for example  new laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees we could charge on consumer loan accounts  or restrict our ability to collect on account balances 
compliance with  or any violation of  existing and future laws or regulations could require us to make material expenditures or otherwise adversely effect our business or financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates as it pertains to the company s borrowings under its credit facility 
the company pays interest on borrowings at either the federal funds rate plus  the prime rate or  at the company s option  the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin ranging from to 
if the interest rates on the company s borrowings average basis points more in fiscal than they did in fiscal  the company s interest expense would increase and income before income taxes would decrease by  this amount is determined solely by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in the interest rate on the company s borrowing cost without consideration for other factors such as actions management might take to mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes
