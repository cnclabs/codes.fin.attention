customer financing management believes that customer financing terms and leasing have become an increasingly important competitive factor for the bally gaming and systems and wall machine and amusement games business units  respectively 
competitive conditions sometimes require bally gaming and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment  especially for sales in emerging markets 
while these financings are normally collateralized by such equipment  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the amount financed 
accordingly  the company has greater exposure to the financial condition of its customers in emerging markets than had historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city 
bally wulff provides customer financing for approximately of its sales and also provides lease financing to its customers 
lease terms are generally for six months  but are also available for terms up to months 
year the year readiness issue  which is common to most businesses  arises from the inability of information systems  and other time and date sensitive products and systems  to properly recognize and process date sensitive information on and beyond january  the result could create errors in information or system failures 
assessments of the potential cost and effects of year issues vary significantly among businesses  and it is extremely difficult to predict the actual impact 
recognizing this uncertainty  management has and is continuing to actively analyze  assess and plan for various year issues across its businesses 
the year issue has an impact on both information technology it systems and non it systems  such as its manufacturing systems and physical facilities including  but not limited to  security systems and utilities 
although management believes that a majority of the company s it systems are year ready  certain systems still have to be tested for year readiness 
the company plans to replace or upgrade those systems that are identified as non year ready during the remainder of calendar certain it systems previously identified as non year compliant are being upgraded or replaced  and this process should be complete by october  non it system issues are more difficult to identify and resolve 
the company is actively identifying non it year issues concerning its products and services  as well as its physical facility locations 
all non it areas identified are included in the company s formal action plans to ensure minimal disruption to its business processes 
management engaged outside consultants to assist and advise management in its assessment process and has implemented their recommendations 
a centralized project management organization has been established to lead the company through its year efforts 
this organization includes dedicated outside resources and internal business representatives 
although management believes that its efforts will be successful and the costs will be immaterial currently estimated between  to  of which approximately  has been spent as of june  to its consolidated financial position and results of operations  it also recognizes that any failure or delay could cause a disruption in its business and have a significant financial impact 
to minimize this potential impact  the company is actively planning and designing a contingency plan to support critical business processes which should be complete be october the company has also initiated efforts to ensure the year readiness of its products and services

the gamblers bonus system used in the company s nevada route operations has been tested and found to be year compliant 
management continues to formulate new plans and update existing plans as it progresses in its research and investigation 
the year readiness of its customers varies  and the company is encouraging its customers to evaluate and prepare their own systems 
these efforts by customers to address year issues may affect the demand for certain products and services  however  the impact on revenue or any change in revenue patterns is highly uncertain 
the company has completed efforts to assess the year readiness of its key suppliers and business partners 
the company s direction in this effort was to ensure the adequacy of resources and supplies to minimize any potential business interruptions 
as part of the company s contingency plans  management has begun to identify and solidify relationships with and access to alternative suppliers and resources to ensure the support and continuation of its critical business operations 
the year issue presents a number of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the company  such as public utility failures  potential claims against it for damages arising from products and services that are not year compliant  and the responsibility of certain government and gaming commissions of the various jurisdictions where the company conducts business 
while the company continues to believe the year issues described above will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of operations  it remains uncertain as to what extent  if any  the company may be impacted

the company s products can be brought into euro compliance by moving a switch inside the wall machine 
the cost of the new front glass showing euro denominations will be borne by the customers 
the company currently has borrowings outstanding on its line of credit facility  a portion of which has a floating rate of interest tied to the euro deutschmark rate 
upon the full implementation of the euro  as of january   the interest rate will be tied to this new index 
the impact of the change in this index  if any  is not known and can not be quantified at this time

research and development costs for the year ended june  were approximately million  an increase of compared to costs of million in the prior year 
this increase is due to an increase in costs at the bally gaming and systems business unit to develop and support a greater number of products  partially offset by a decrease in costs at the wall machines and amusement games business unit 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended june  was million  an increase of compared to depreciation and amortization of million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due primarily to an increase in amortization of deferred financing costs and an increase in depreciation related to the growth in the number of gaming machines deployed for the route operations  partially offset by a decrease at the wall machines and amusement games business unit 
as a result of the refinancing transaction  the company recorded an extraordinary loss of million  which included million for the premium on the senior notes  million in transaction fees and expenses  and million for the write off of deferred financing costs 
the company also recorded a million charge for the cost of the rainbow royalty buyout 
additionally  the company recorded a million charge to equity and a corresponding increase in the net loss applicable to common shares for the difference between the carrying value and the liquidation value of the series b special stock  all of which was redeemed on september  at the liquidation price of per share  plus accrued dividends 
interest income and expense and income taxes net interest expense in the year ended june   increased to million  an increase of compared to the net interest expense of million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to a higher level of debt resulting from the company s new senior subordinated notes due and the term loan facilities and revolving credit facility which replaced the company s senior secured notes and the series b special stock as part of the refinancing of the company s capital structure completed in september  resulting in substantially lower overall fixed charges 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million in the year ended june   compared to a provision of million in the prior year 
the current year provision is due primarily to income taxes for the wall machines and amusement games business unit and domestic state income taxes 
at june   the company has net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which are available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  expiring in the years through at june  the company has foreign tax credit carry forwards of approximately million and alternative minimum tax credit amt carry forwards of approximately million

risk factors cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the information contained in this form k and the company s other filings with the securities exchange commission may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended  and is subject to the safe harbor created thereby 
such information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect results in the future and  accordingly  such results may differ from those expressed in any forward looking statements herein 
future operating results may be adversely affected as a result of a number of factors 
set forth below are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such looking forward statements 
high leverage  ability to service debt  liquidity after the completion of the refinancing  the company has a substantially increased amount of indebtedness 
as of june  the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the company s long term indebtedness including current maturities was million 
the company also has available to it up to million in unborrowed capacity under the revolving credit facility 
the company had a net capital deficiency at june  of million 
the company s credit facility and indenture contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company and certain of its subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain acquisitions  repurchase equity interests as defined or subordinated indebtedness  issue or sell equity interests of the company s subsidiaries as defined  engage in mergers or consolidations  or engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates and otherwise restrict corporate activities 
there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect the company s ability to finance its future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the interest of the company 
in addition  the bank credit facility also requires the company to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
the ability of the company to comply with such ratios may be affected by events beyond the company s control 
a breach of any of these covenants or the inability of the company to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the bank credit facility 
in the event of any such default  the lenders under the new credit facility could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facility  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  to require the company to apply all of its available cash to repay such borrowings or to prevent the company from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes  any of which would be an event of default under the senior subordinated notes 
if the company were unable to repay any such borrowings when due  the lenders could proceed against their collateral 
if the indebtedness under the bank credit facility or the notes were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that the assets of the company would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
due to the low amount of consolidated ebitda as defined earned by the company in the december quarter  the company did not meet the financial covenants in the bank credit facility 
the company and the banks amended the current and future financial maintenance covenants in the bank credit facility effective december  the company is in compliance with such amended covenants  but no assurance can be given that the company will continue to meet the amended covenants in the future 
the company s obligations to make principal and interest payments on outstanding indebtedness  and to comply with the covenants in the indenture and the agreements governing borrowings under the bank credit facility  will have several important effects on its future operations including the following i the portion of the company s cash flow from operations which will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness will not be available for other purposes  ii certain of the company s borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates  iii the company may be more vulnerable to downturns in its business or in the general economy and may be restricted from making acquisitions  introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities  and iv the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired 
additionally  the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to general economic and regulatory conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to generate the cash flow necessary to permit the company to meet its fixed charges and repayment obligations 
any inability of the company to service its fixed charges and repayment obligations would have a significant adverse effect on the company 
operating history recent losses the company incurred net losses of million including million of costs related to the refinancing for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the year ended june  there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable  and that it will not incur unusual or non recurring charges  in the future 
competition bally gaming and systems 
the market for gaming machines is extremely competitive  and there are a number of established  well financed and well known companies producing machines that compete with each of bally gaming and systems product lines in each of bally gaming and systems markets 
the domestic market for gaming machines is dominated by a single competitor  international game technology igt  with a number of smaller competitors in the field 
in addition  certain technology oriented companies have recently entered or may enter the gaming machine market 
management believes that some of these competitors have greater capital resources than the company 
competition among gaming machine manufacturers  particularly with respect to sales of gaming machines into new and emerging markets  is based on competitive customer pricing and financing terms  appeal to the player and quality of the product  and having an extensive distribution and sales network 
sales to established casinos in nevada normally require completion of a successful trial period for the machines in the casino 
the competition for the computerized monitoring systems currently consists of igt  casino data systems and  to a lesser extent  acres gaming  inc  gaming systems international  inc  mikohn gaming corporation and logical solutions international 
competition is keen in this market due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and the jurisdictions in which they operate 
pricing  product feature and function  accuracy  and reliability are all main factors in determining a provider s success in selling its system 
bally gaming and systems believes the future success of its operations will be determined by its ability to bring new and innovative products to the marketplace while at the same time maintaining the base of loyal existing customers 
wall machines and amusements games 
germany s wall machine manufacturing industry is dominated by bally wulff and two of its competitors 
management believes these three entities collectively account for more than of the entire market for wall machines which exists almost exclusively in germany 
bally wulff s two major competitors have greater resources than the company and own and operate a significant number of arcades  which gives them a competitive advantage arising from a built in market for their games and the ability to test market new games in their own arcades 
in addition  wall machines compete for floor space in arcades with non payout entertainment machines  which have gathered an increasing amount of the space in arcades 
these machines are not subject to the strict german licensing requirements governing wall machines 
bally wulff has not fully participated in the non payout entertainment machine market 
the wall machine industry is subject to a number of regulations which are currently being reviewed by the german legislature 
the outcome of this review and whether it will be favorable or unfavorable to bally wulff cannot be predicted at this time 
the potential for changes in these regulations is currently having a negative demand on the market 
route operations 
the competition for obtaining and renewing route contracts in nevada is high and continues to intensify 
such competition has  over time  reduced the company s gross profit margins for such operations 
in addition  such competition has required the company to provide financial incentives to retain or obtain certain route locations 
such incentives include long term lease commitments  guarantees of leases in favor of owners of local establishments  substantial promotional allowances and advance deposits  payments of lease rentals in advance and loans for buildings and tenant improvement costs 
notwithstanding the company s business strategy of emphasizing profitability rather than market share  the future success of the company s route operations will continue to be dependent to some extent on its ability and willingness to provide such financial inducements 
although the company has historically generated sufficient new route contracts to offset the loss of old route contracts  due to increased competition  the increased sophistication and bargaining power of customers and possibly other factors not yet known  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain new route contracts or renew or extend its route contracts upon their expiration or termination  or that  if renewed or extended  the terms will be as favorable to the company 
in louisiana  the company s route operations at the racetrack and otbs compete with various truck stops and locations with liquor licenses throughout the new orleans area  as well as riverboat gaming and one land based casino which is scheduled to re open in new orleans in october casino operations 
the operation of casinos is also a highly competitive business 
the principal competitive factors in the industry include the quality and location of the facility  the nature and quality of the amenities and customer services offered and the implementation and success of marketing programs 
in sparks  nevada  the principal competition for the company s operations comes from larger casinos focusing on the local market 
the company s rainbow casino in vicksburg  mississippi faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities serving this market 
competition from casinos in nearby locations may also be reducing the market from which vicksburg casinos draw most of their patrons 
moreover  additional potential gaming sites remain in and around vicksburg and sparks  some of these sites may be closer to larger population centers and  if developed  might enjoy a competitive advantage over the company s casinos 
lady luck gaming corporation owns a site in vicksburg and may develop a project that would include a dockside casino  hotel and related amenities 
previously  horseshoe gaming  llc had announced a casino hotel and auto racing complex on the big black river which is between vicksburg and jackson  mississippi 
the legality of that site for gaming is currently in litigation 
at this time management does not know which  if any  of these sites will be developed 
both of these projects will be contingent on several factors including regulatory approval and financing 
product development the future success of the company depends to a large extent upon its ability to design  manufacture and market technologically sophisticated and entertaining products that achieve high levels of player acceptance 
the development of a successful new product or product design by a competitor could adversely affect sales of the company s products and force it to attempt to respond quickly with its own competing products 
response speed is lower in jurisdictions requiring product approvals prior to commercialization 
the company s plans with respect to the introduction of more sophisticated technology into the electronic gaming machine market are designed to lead to an increase in market share and profitability for the company 
however  there is no assurance that any such products will be developed  or that if developed they will receive necessary regulatory approvals or be commercially successful 
although the company is developing a number of new products  there can be no guarantee of commercial acceptance of any of its products 
the gaming industry is employing new technology in many new areas  and the company and its competitors continue to file for patents protecting such technologies 
although the company is not aware of any patent violations  there can be no assurances that patents currently pending may be determined to have infringed upon an existing patent held by a third party 
bally gaming and systems has recently deployed new products that are placed in casinos and earn recurring revenues and cash flows 
the amount of revenues earned is dependent upon the earning power of the game 
the games will likely have a shorter life than more traditional games and the company will have to continue to design and deploy successful games to maintain this stream of revenues 
there can be no assurance that the games recently deployed will be successful or that the company will be able to design and deploy new recurring revenue games 
sales to non traditional gaming markets the continued growth of the non traditional markets outside of nevada and atlantic city for electronic gaming machines is contingent upon the public s acceptance of these markets and an ongoing regulatory approval process by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
the company cannot predict which new jurisdictions or markets  if any  will approve the operation of electronic gaming machines  the timing of any such approval or the level of the company s participation in any such markets or that jurisdictions currently permitting gaming will continue to do so in the future 
management believes that customer financing terms and leasing have become an increasingly important competitive factor for the bally gaming and systems and wall machine and amusement games business units  respectively 
competitive conditions sometimes require bally gaming and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment  especially for sales in emerging markets 
while these financings are normally collateralized by such equipment  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the amount financed 
accordingly  the company has greater exposure to the financial condition of its customers in emerging markets than had historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city 
bally wulff provides customer financing for approximately of its sales and also provides lease financing to its customers 
lease terms are generally for six months  but are also available for terms up to months 
foreign operations the company s business in foreign markets is subject to the risks customarily associated with such activities 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  expropriation  nationalization and other economic  tax and regulatory policies of local governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 
bally gaming and systems has million of receivables from countries outside of the united states most of which are denominated in us dollars 
the company does not generally enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company will be dependent  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of such executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect upon the company s operations 
strict regulation by gaming authorities the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines and the conduct of gaming operations is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulation by various gaming authorities each  a gaming authority 
although the laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which the company operates vary in their technical requirements and are subject to amendment from time to time  virtually all these jurisdictions require licenses  permits  documentation of the qualification  including evidence of integrity and financial stability  and other forms of approval for companies engaged in gaming operations and the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines as well as for the officers  directors  major stockholders and key personnel of such companies 
the company and its key personnel have obtained  or applied for  all government licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits and approvals necessary for the manufacture and distribution  and operation where permitted  of its gaming machines in the jurisdictions in which it currently does business 
however  there can be no assurance that such licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits or approvals will be given or renewed in the future or that the company will obtain the licenses necessary to operate in emerging markets 
during the past twelve months  the regulations governing the conduct of gaming for route locations in nevada have been modified 
while the company believes such regulations will not significantly impact its operations or financial results  no assurance can be given that future changes in regulations will not be enacted that would negatively impact operations or financial results 
the company s business is dependent on regulatory requirements 
for example  recurring demand exists for bally wulff s products because german regulations limit the permissible use of wall machines to a period of four years 
a change in applicable regulations could adversely affect the market for the company s products and services 
the company currently has an agreement with fair grounds corporation  jefferson downs corporation and finish line management corporation to be the exclusive operator of video poker machines at the only racetrack and ten associated otbs in the greater new orleans area 
on november  voters in louisiana approved a proposition to eliminate video poker in one of the seven parishes in which the company operates gaming machines in otbs in the greater new orleans area 
these operations also depend on the financial viability of the racetrack and the otbs  which is beyond the control of the company 
see business gaming regulations and licensing 
additionally  there can be no assurance that any regulatory agency will not enact new rules or change regulations that would negatively impact the company s ability to operate or its financial results 
gaming taxes and value added taxes gaming operators are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to corporate and state income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
any material increase in these taxes or fees  which could occur prospectively or retroactively  would adversely affect the company 
sales of bally wulff s products in germany are generally subject to value added taxes vat 
during fiscal  bally wulff increased the amount of tax reserves by million to a total reserve of million as a result of developments in ongoing quadrennial audits of wulff s tax returns for the years through the german tax authorities have proposed preliminary adjustments of million  which has been accrued 
the german tax authorities have not yet issued the final assessment from their quadrennial audits 
the government in the german state of north rhine westphalia modified its regulations to permit local municipalities to independently impose additional taxes on gaming machine operators beginning january  in the past  the imposition of tax rate increases has adversely affected bally wulff s sales 
there can be no assurance that municipalities will not impose new taxes or raise existing taxes in the future 
the company pays and expects to continue to pay substantial taxes and fees in nevada  louisiana and mississippi and expects to pay substantial taxes and fees in any other jurisdiction in which it conducts gaming operations 
there can be no assurance as to future increases in taxation on gaming operations 
change of control upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined  each holder of the senior subordinated notes may require the company to repurchase the senior subordinated notes held by such holder at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
the bank credit facility prohibits the company from purchasing any senior subordinated notes  and provides that the occurrence of certain change of control events with respect to the company would constitute a default thereunder 
in the event of a change of control  the company must offer to repay all borrowings under the bank credit facility or obtain the consent of its lenders under the credit agreement to the purchase of senior subordinated notes 
if the company does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings  the company will remain prohibited from purchasing senior subordinated notes 
in such case  the company s failure to repurchase tendered senior subordinated notes would constitute a default under the indenture  which  in turn  would constitute a default under the new credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial ability to purchase the senior subordinated notes upon the occurrence of a change of control 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to comply with all of its obligations under the new credit facility  the indenture  and its other indebtedness upon the occurrence of a change of control 
currency rate fluctuations the company derives revenues from its non us subsidiaries  all of which revenues are denominated in their local currencies  and their results are affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies and the non us dollar 
most of the currencies in countries in which the company has foreign operations weakened versus the us dollar in and  which resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars 
the average currency rate changes for the year ended june  resulted in an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues of approximately million or and on operating income of million or 
however  the average currency rate changes for the year ended june  resulted in a favorable impact on consolidated revenues of approximately million and on operating income of million 
the company does not currently utilize hedging instruments 
market risks during the normal course of business the company is routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest and currency rate movements  collectibility of accounts and notes receivable  and recoverability of residual values on leased assets 
the company constantly assesses these risks and has established policies and practices designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although the company does not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurances can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 
the company has performed a sensitivity analysis of its financial instruments which consist of the company s cash and cash equivalents and debt 
the company has no derivative financial instruments 
in performing the sensitivity analysis  the company defines risk of loss as the hypothetical impact on earnings  resulting from changes in the market interest rates or currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis at june   are as follows interest rate risk the company had total debt as of june  of million  of which million of borrowings under the term loan facilities and million of borrowings on the revolving credit facility are at a floating rate based on libor and million of german borrowings on revolving credit facilities are at a floating rate based on the eurodeutschmark borrowing rate 
if the libor and eurodeutschmark rates were each to increase or decrease by basis points  with all other factors remaining constant  earnings would decrease or increase by approximately million on a pre tax basis  all other factors remaining constant 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company has subsidiaries with the following functional currencies german deutschemark  australian dollar and south african rand  although the only subsidiaries currently with material amounts of assets  liabilities and revenues are in germany 
if the german deutschemark declined against the us dollar  there would be a corresponding decrease in earnings reported in the consolidated group  when compared to the equivalent level of german deutschemark earnings  of approximately million 
such a change in the german deutschemark would result in an immaterial transaction loss  but would result in a charge to accumulated other comprhensive loss  which is a component of stockholder s equity  of approximately million  all other factors remaining constant 
estimates the company s financial statements are prepared using estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates either favorably or unfavorably  which may impact future results
