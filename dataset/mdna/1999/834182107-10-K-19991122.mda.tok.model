results of operations the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price competition 
these and other factors affecting the electronics industry  or any of solectron s major customers in particular  could materially harm solectron s results of operations 
see trends and uncertainties for factors relating to possible fluctuation of operating results and our competitors 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
years ended august  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development acquisition costs operating income net interest income expense income before income taxes income taxes net income net sales solectron s net sales have increased significantly in each of the past several years  reflecting the growing trend toward outsourcing within the electronics industry 
for the year ended august   net sales grew to billion  an increase of over fiscal net sales 
fiscal net sales of billion were greater than fiscal the sales growth in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to significant sales volume increases from our worldwide customers and from our acquisitions 
the sales growth in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to significant increases in sales volume from both existing and new customers worldwide  including the completion of the transfer of production from certain ericsson plants to various solectron locations around the world 
net sales at solectron s international sites  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  have grown over the last three fiscal years 
international locations contributed of consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal americas within the americas  the sales growth in fiscal was primarily due to demand increases and acquisitions of assets from ericsson  ncr  ibm ecat and mitsubishi during fiscal and sales from the acquisition of ibm ecat in austin  texas  were recognized beginning in march because the texas site consistently reports its results one month in arrears 
in addition  the mexico site was among the largest contributors due to the strong demand growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal the milpitas  california  site also experienced sales growth despite the planned transfer of personal computer pcb programs and computer peripherals systems assembly programs to mexico and networking business to penang 
the sales growth from fiscal to fiscal was attributable to start up and major new programs at the texas and massachusetts sites and the addition of new sites in mexico and brazil in fiscal additionally  the acquired sites from ncr and ibm ecat in charlotte contributed incremental net sales to fiscal as compared to fiscal solectron s operations in milpitas  california  contributed a substantial portion of solectron s net sales and operating income during fiscal  and in recent years  management has undertaken deliberate actions to achieve improved global load balancing by transferring certain projects from the milpitas site to other sites worldwide 
however  the performance of the milpitas operation is expected to continue to be a significant factor in the overall financial performance of solectron 
any adverse material change to the customer base  product mix  efficiency or other attributes of this site could materially harm solectron s consolidated results of operations 
europe net sales at all of solectron s european sites increased in fiscal over fiscal the increase was principally due to overall business growth and increased demand from our telecommunications customers 
net sales from our european operations in fiscal increased over fiscal primarily due to core business growth and new accounts 
sales growth at the scotland site was particularly strong due to the ramp up of major customers pcb assembly activities 
the new locations in sweden also contributed to the sales increase in fiscal compared to fiscal asia all asian sites contributed to the sales increase in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to core business growth 
in particular  sales growth at the penang  malaysia  site was attributable to increased demand from personal computer customers and networking business transferred from milpitas  california 
the johor  malaysia  site also experienced higher product demand 
net sales from the asian manufacturing locations increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily as a result of certain projects transferred from the milpitas  california  site to meet demand growth 
solectron does not currently anticipate any future decline in sales  but continues to seek diversification of our customer base among many countries  market segments and product lines within market segments 
as a result of solectron s international sales and facilities  solectron s operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
while  to date  these dynamics have not materially harmed solectron s results of operations  we cannot assure that there will not be such an impact in the future 
see trends and uncertainties for factors pertaining to our international sales and fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency for further discussion of potential adverse effects in operating results associated with the risks of doing business abroad 
net sales to major customers several major customers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  and the following table lists these customers and the percentage of net sales attributed to them 
years ended august  cisco systems  inc cisco hewlett packard company hp sun microsystems  inc sun nortel networks  inc formerly bay networks  inc net sales less than no other customers accounted for more than of net sales during any of the years presented 
solectron s top ten customers accounted for of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal we are dependent upon continued revenues from cisco  hp  ibm  sun and our other top ten customers 
we cannot guarantee that these or any other customers will not increase or decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales either individually or as a group 
consequently  any material decrease in sales to these or other customers could materially harm solectron s results of operations 
solectron believes that its ability to continue achieving growth will depend upon growth in sales to existing customers for their current and future product generations  successful marketing to new customers  and future geographic expansion 
customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of delayed  canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be assured 
in addition  we cannot assure that any of solectron s current customers will continue to utilize solectron s services 
because of these factors  we cannot assure that solectron s historical revenue growth rate will continue 
see trends and uncertainties for a discussion of certain factors affecting the management of growth  geographic expansion  and potential fluctuations in sales and results of operations 
gross profit the gross margin percentages were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the reduction in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects increased sales derived from systems build projects that generally yield lower margins than pcb assembly  high volume pcb projects and green field start up operations 
solectron s net sales from systems build projects contributed of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal in addition  the amortization of intellectual property resulting from certain acquisitions reduced gross margins 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a shift toward higher volume projects and systems build projects that typically have lower margins and start up costs associated with our operations in china and mexico 
for the foreseeable future  solectron s gross margin is expected to depend primarily on product mix  production efficiencies  utilization of manufacturing capacity  start up and integration costs of new and acquired businesses  the percentage of sales derived from systems build projects  pricing within the electronics industry  and the cost structure at individual sites 
over time  gross margins at the individual sites and for solectron as a whole may continue to fluctuate 
we anticipate that a larger percentage of our sales may be derived from systems build projects in future periods 
increases in the systems build business  additional costs associated with new projects  and price erosion within the electronics industry could harm our gross margin 
also  while the availability of raw materials fluctuates from time to time and generally meets our revenue projections for the foreseeable future  component availability is still subject to lead time and other constraints that could possibly limit our revenue growth 
because of these factors and others discussed under trends and uncertainties below  we cannot assure that solectron s gross margin will not fluctuate or decrease in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal the dollar increase in fiscal primarily reflects expenses associated with sales growth including increased human resources costs necessary to support business infrastructure and further development costs of information systems  as well as increased costs of acquisition related activities 
the addition of newly acquired sites in fiscal from mitsubishi and ibm ecat in austin  texas  also contributed to the increase in sg a expenses 
the fiscal increase was due to investment in infrastructure such as personnel and related departmental expenses at all manufacturing locations as well as investment in information systems to support the increased size and complexity of our business 
additionally  the sites added in fiscal  including brazil  ncr and ibm ecat in charlotte  north carolina  contributed to the increase in sg a expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the primary reason for the fiscal and decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales is the significant increase in the sales base  partially offset by the costs associated with investments in our business infrastructure  information systems and start up costs for new sites 
we anticipate sg a expenses will continue to increase in terms of absolute dollars in the future and may possibly increase as a percentage of net sales as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to support our current and prospective business 
research and development expenses with the exception of our force computers operation  solectron s research and development r d activities have been focused primarily on the development of prototype and engineering design capabilities  fine pitch interconnecting technologies which include ball grid array  tape automated bonding  multichip modules  chip on flex  chip on board and flip chip  high reliability environmental stress test technology and the implementation of environmentally friendly assembly processes such as voc free and no clean 
force s r d efforts are concentrated on new product development and improvement of product designs through improvements in functionality and the use of microprocessors in embedded applications 
in absolute dollars  r d expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses were in fiscal  and the increases in r d expenses were primarily due to force s focused effort on development and improvement of its products 
we expect that r d expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future and may increase as a percentage of net sales while force and the newly acquired ibm sites continue to invest in their r d efforts 
in addition  certain new r d projects will be undertaken at some of solectron s asian sites  particularly at the sites in malaysia because of the tax holiday 
see income taxes 
acquisition costs a one time charge for acquisition costs of approximately million was incurred in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of force computers in november net interest income expense net interest expense was million in fiscal and zero in fiscal net interest income was million in fiscal the net increase in interest expense in fiscal over fiscal was attributable to the issuance of yield zero coupon convertible senior notes in january  partially offset by lesser interest expense from the convertible subordinated notes which were converted to common stock in march the interest expense in fiscal principally related to the zero coupon convertible senior notes  convertible subordinated notes and senior notes 
additionally  the fiscal interest expense was partially offset by interest income earned on undeployed cash and short term investments 
in fiscal  we capitalized approximately million of interest expense related to the costs of computer software developed for internal use and the facility construction projects at the brazil  china  mexico and romania sites 
in fiscal  the net zero interest expense was primarily due to the interest expense related to the senior notes and convertible subordinated notes entirely offset by interest income earned on undeployed cash and short term investments 
we expect to use more of our undeployed cash during future periods in order to fund anticipated future growth 
see trends and uncertainties for factors relating to management growth and potential fluctuations in operating results 
income taxes income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily due to increased income before income taxes 
solectron s effective income tax rate decreased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal in general  the effective income tax rate is largely a function of the balance between income from domestic and international operations 
solectron s international operations  taken as a whole  have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states  primarily due to the tax holiday granted to solectron s sites in malaysia 
the malaysian tax holiday is effective through january   subject to some conditions  including certain levels of research and development expenditures 
solectron has also been granted various tax holidays in china  which are effective for various terms and are subject to some conditions 
recent accounting pronouncements effective in the first quarter of fiscal  solectron adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which requires us to report and display certain information related to comprehensive income 
comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income is classified separately into foreign currency items  minimum pension liability adjustments  and unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on solectron s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
effective in the first quarter of fiscal  solectron adopted the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and for determining when specific costs should be capitalized and when they should be expensed 
the impact of adopting sop was not significant to solectron s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the aicpa issued sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop requires that all start up costs related to new operations must be expensed as incurred 
in addition  all start up costs that were capitalized in the past must be written off when sop is adopted 
solectron expects that the adoption of sop will not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we will be required to implement sop in our first quarter of fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
solectron anticipates that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
implementation of this standard has recently been delayed by the fasb for a month period 
we will now adopt sfas no 
in our first quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources working capital was billion at august   compared to billion at august  a major component of working capital at august   primarily consisted of undeployed cash from the proceeds of the zero coupon convertible senior notes in january and the common stock offering in august during fiscal  we used approximately million of cash and short term investments to fund our asset acquisitions including mitsubishi in braselton  georgia  ibm s ecat in austin  texas  and trimble in sunnyvale  california 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we used additional funds for our acquisitions 
as we continue to grow  it is expected that we will require greater amounts of working capital to support our operations 
we believe that our current level of working capital  together with cash generated from operations and our available credit facilities  will provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to finance our rapid expansion  including establishing new locations or financing additional acquisitions 
we cannot assure that such funds  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
inventory levels fluctuate directly with the volume of solectron s manufacturing 
changes or significant fluctuations in product market demands can cause fluctuations in inventory levels that may result in changes of inventory turns and liquidity 
historically  we have been able to manage our inventory levels with regard to these fluctuations 
however  should material fluctuations occur in product demand  we could experience slower turns and reduced liquidity 
the increase in inventory levels at year end from year end is substantially a result of overall growth and the greater number of manufacturing locations at august   compared to august   as each location must maintain a level of inventory adequate to allow the location to respond to customer manufacturing requirements 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decreases in fiscal and were primarily due to increased levels of accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by increases in net income  depreciation and amortization  and current liabilities 
during fiscal  solectron invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
a large portion of these expenditures related to the purchase of new equipment  primarily surface mount assembly and test equipment  to meet current and expected production levels  as well as to replace or upgrade older equipment that was retired or sold 
significant expenditures were also made for the acquisition of land and buildings for our new manufacturing sites  principally in brazil  mexico and romania 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
in addition to working capital as of august   which included cash and cash equivalents of billion and short term investments of million  solectron has available a million unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility that is subject to financial covenants and expires in april we also have approximately million in available uncommitted foreign credit facilities 
year issues solectron has developed a comprehensive program to address the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as computer systems  manufacturing equipment and industrial control systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such dates could generate erroneous information or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for us from unforeseen problems in our systems and from third parties with whom we deal on business transactions worldwide 
failures of solectron s and or third parties computer systems  manufacturing equipment and industrial control systems could materially harm our ability to conduct business 
we have formed a worldwide task force and have implemented a comprehensive program to analyze our internal systems as well as all external systems including  without limitation  vendor  customer and banking systems upon which we are dependent  to identify and evaluate any potential year issues 
this task force meets regularly and tracks progress against the program  modifying it as needed to help ensure timely completion 
we are committed to achieving year compliance  however  because a significant portion of the potential problem is external to us and therefore outside of our direct control  we cannot assure that we will be fully year compliant 
in addition  as full testing of year functionality must occur in a simulated environment  we will not be able to test full system year interfaces and capabilities prior to the year as of august   we had completed an inventory  assessment  remediation and testing of internal systems  hardware  software  manufacturing equipment and embedded chips in industrial control instruments 
while we believe that our testing and evaluation have been entirely comprehensive  we cannot assure that all systems critical to year compliance have been identified  or that the corrective actions identified will be completely successful 
as of august   we had inventoried every key supplier of goods and services to us and considered the potential impact on us and our customers of year compliance by these suppliers 
also  we have evaluated the key suppliers responses to our mailing surveys and have been auditing these suppliers 
we will continue to disqualify potentially noncompliant sources  look for alternative sources and requalify new suppliers to help mediate potential business disruptions 
we are also involved with various geographic year consortiums worldwide  with the intent to leverage contacts and information for commonly used suppliers and services such as utility companies 
we are a founding member of the high tech consortium htc year beyond  which through collaborative efforts has the goal of ensuring that member companies address year readiness on a coordinated basis 
the htc has been addressing the risk associated with the interconnected supply chain 
detailed supplier audits by the htc s independent consultants started in late march 
in addition  we have nearly completed the review of edi linkages and data transmission for our customers and suppliers 
while we believe that we will be able to qualify alternative suppliers  we cannot fully evaluate the extent of potential problems and the costs associated with corrective actions 
we now estimate the cost to complete the current compliance program to be in the range of million to million 
of this amount  approximately million is for the replacement of capital equipment  of which approximately half comprises noncompliant systems that would not otherwise have been replaced at this time 
the variability in these estimates depends on the extent to which supplier requalification is needed and contingency plan implementation costs 
we cannot assure that actual costs will not be materially higher than currently anticipated 
a significant portion of these costs is not incremental to us  but rather represents the redeployment of existing information technology resources 
certain other information technology projects have been delayed due to the focus on year issues 
the potential costs of the redeployment of personnel and delays in implementing other projects is not known but could be substantial 
the total amount spent on the compliance program this fiscal year through august   was million  of which million principally pertained to payroll costs for personnel involved in the program and costs of outside consultants and million principally pertained to the replacement of capital equipment 
prior to fiscal  costs of software and hardware applications incurred for year compliance were not material and related payroll costs for the information systems group were not tracked separately 
we have developed contingency plans for the replacement and requalification of suppliers  the possible stockpiling of key supplies  the relocation of production using our disaster recovery plans  and the purchase of emergency generators in the event of power outages at any of our worldwide locations 
we are unable to determine the extent of the potential effect on us  our suppliers or our customers due to the failure of any systems caused by the year issues 
any significant failures could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition 
trends and uncertainties a majority of our net sales comes from a small number of customers  if we lose any of these customers  our net sales could decline significantly 
a majority of our annual net sales comes from a small number of our customers 
our ten largest customers accounted for of net sales in fiscal since we are dependent upon continued net sales from our ten largest customers  any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from these or other major customers could cause our net sales to decline significantly 
some of these customers individually account for more than ten percent of our annual net sales 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain any of our ten largest customers or any other accounts 
in addition  our customers may materially reduce the level of services ordered from us at any time 
this could cause a significant decline in our net sales and we may not be able to reduce the accompanying expenses at the same time 
our long term contracts do not include minimum purchase requirements 
although we have long term contracts with a few of our top ten customers  including ericsson telecom ab  ncr corporation and ibm corporation  under which these customers are obligated to obtain services from us  they are not obligated to purchase any minimum amount of services 
as a result  we cannot guarantee that we will receive any net sales from these contracts 
in addition  these customers with whom we have long term contracts may materially reduce the level of services ordered at any time 
this could cause a significant decline in our net sales and we may not be able to reduce our accompanying expenses at the same time 
possible fluctuation of operating results from quarter to quarter could affect the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly earnings may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors including the following differences in the profitability of the types of manufacturing services we provide 
for example  systems assembly services have lower gross margins than pcb assembly services  our ability to maximize the hours of use of our equipment and facilities is dependent on the duration of the production run time for each job and customer  the amount of automation that we can use in the manufacturing process for cost reduction varies depending upon the complexity of the product being made  our ability to optimize the ordering of inventory as to timing and amount to avoid holding inventory in excess of immediate production  and fluctuations in demand for our services or the products being manufactured 
therefore  our operating results in the future could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock could be harmed 
we are dependent upon the electronics industry which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles  our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis would harm our business 
a majority of our net sales is to companies in the electronics industry  which is subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
if our customers are unable to create products that keep pace with the changing technological environment  our customers products could become obsolete and the demand for our services could decline significantly 
if we are unable to offer technologically advanced  cost effective  quick response manufacturing services to customers  demand for our services will also decline 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales is derived from our ability to offer complete service solutions for our customers 
for example  if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services  our net sales would significantly decline 
we potentially bear the risk of price increases associated with potential shortages in the availability of electronics components 
at various times  there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry 
one of the services that we perform for many customers is purchasing electronics components used in the manufacturing of the customers products 
as a result of this service  we potentially bear the risk of price increases for these components because we are unable to purchase components at the same time as we agree with our customers on the pricing for the components 
our net sales could decline if our competitors provide comparable manufacturing services at a lower cost 
we compete with different contract manufacturers  depending on the type of service we provide or the geographic locale of our operations 
these competitors may have greater manufacturing  financial  r d and or marketing resources than we have 
in addition  we may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors because those competitors may have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide 
our inability to provide comparable or better manufacturing services at a lower cost than our competitors could cause our net sales to decline 
if we are unable to manage our rapid growth and assimilate new operations in a cost effective manner  our profitability could decline 
we have experienced rapid growth over the last five fiscal years 
our historical growth may not continue 
in recent years  we have established operations in different places throughout the world 
for example  in fiscal  we opened offices in taipei  taiwan  tel aviv  israel  and norrkoping and stockholm  sweden  and commenced manufacturing operations in guadalajara  mexico  and timisoara  romania 
also in fiscal  we acquired foreign facilities in sao paulo  brazil  and dublin  ireland 
furthermore  through acquisitions in fiscal and  we acquired facilities in duluth  georgia  columbia  south carolina  and memphis  tennessee  and enhanced our capabilities in charlotte  north carolina  austin  texas  and milpitas  california 
also during that period  we announced a joint venture with ingram micro inc in september  we announced the acquisition of smart modular technologies  inc during october and november of  we completed the asset acquisition of ibm s netfinity server operations in greenock  scotland  and acquired ibm s nulogix technical services  inc in vaughan  canada  in its entirety 
also in october  we signed a definitive agreement with acer  inc acer  a core unit of the acer group  the world s third largest pc manufacturer  to form a strategic alliance to provide global design  manufacturing and service solutions for oem branded personal computers  servers and workstations 
also in november  we announced the signing of memoranda of understanding for solectron to acquire the complex systems manufacturing assets of ericsson s telecommunications infrastructure equipment operations in longuenesse  france  and ostersund  sweden 
as we manage and continue to expand new operations  we may incur substantial infrastructure and working capital costs 
if we do not achieve sufficient growth to offset increased expenses associated with rapid expansion  our profitability will decline 
we need to manage integration of our acquisitions to maintain profitability 
in fiscal and  we completed acquisitions of manufacturing assets and facilities from ericsson  ncr  ibm  mitsubishi and trimble navigation limited and acquired all of the capital stock of sequel  inc we also continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may pursue additional acquisitions over time 
these acquisitions involve risks  including integration and management of the operations  retention of key personnel  integration of purchasing operations and information systems  management of an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business  and diversion of management s attention from other ongoing business concerns 
our profitability will suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage recent acquisitions  as well as any future acquisitions that we might pursue  or if we do not achieve sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses associated with these acquisitions 
our international sales are a significant and growing portion of our net sales  we are increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales came from outside of the united states 
as a result of our foreign sales and facilities  our operations are subject to a variety of risks that are unique to international operations  including the following adverse movement of foreign currencies against the us dollar in which our results are reported  import and export duties  and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes that could erode our profit margins or restrict exports  potential restrictions on the transfer of funds  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  and the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws 
in addition  we have operations in several locations that have inflationary economies or potentially volatile currencies  including guadalajara  mexico  sao paulo  brazil  suzhou  china  and timisoara  romania 
in the future  these factors may harm our results of operations 
markets in southeast asia  latin america and eastern europe have recently experienced and are experiencing currency  economic and political instability 
as of august   we recorded million in cumulative foreign exchange translation losses on our balance sheet which were primarily the result of the devaluation of the brazilian real 
while  to date  these factors have not had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  we cannot assure that there will not be such an impact 
furthermore  while we may adopt measures to reduce the impact of losses resulting from volatile currencies and other risks of doing business abroad  we cannot assure that such measures will be adequate 
the malaysian government adopted currency exchange controls  including controls on its currency  the ringgit  held outside malaysia  and established a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit against the us dollar 
the fixed exchange rate provides a stable rate environment when applied to local expenses denominated in ringgit 
the long term impact of such controls is not predictable due to dynamic economic conditions that also affect or are affected by other regional or global economies 
we have been granted a tax holiday which is effective through january   subject to some conditions  for our malaysian sites 
we have also been granted various tax holidays in china 
these tax holidays are effective for various terms and are subject to some conditions 
it is possible that the current tax holidays will be terminated or modified or that future tax holidays that solectron may seek will not be granted 
if the current tax holidays are terminated or modified  or if additional tax holidays are not granted in the future  solectron s effective income tax rate would likely increase 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
presently  we use foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
as of august   all of the foreign currency hedging contracts were scheduled to mature in three months or less and there were no material deferred gains or losses 
in addition  our international operations in some instances act as a natural hedge because both operating expenses and a portion of sales are denominated in local currency 
in these instances  including our current experience involving the devaluation of the brazilian real  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower sales when translated to us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
however  because less than of net sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we do not believe our total exposure to be significant 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of countries other than the us in which we conduct business could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  and if we price our products and services in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products and services in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 
we have a task force which evaluates the effect of the euro conversion on us from many perspectives 
we continue to evaluate our tax positions and all outstanding contracts in currencies of the participating countries to determine the effects  if any  of the euro conversion 
it is possible that the euro conversion could significantly harm our results of operations and financial position due to competitive and other factors relating to the conversion that we cannot predict 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time  maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
as of august   approximately of our total portfolio was scheduled to mature in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than two years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of august  total fair value dollars in millions cash equivalents and short term investments    average interest rates we have entered into an interest rate swap transaction under which we pay a fixed rate of interest hedging against the variable interest rates charged by the lessor for the facility lease at milpitas  california 
the interest rate swap expires in the year  which coincides with the maturity date of the lease term 
as we intend to hold the interest rate swap until the maturity date  we are not subject to market risk 
in fact  such interest rate swap has fixed the interest rate for the facility lease  thus reducing interest rate risk 
solectron s debt instruments are subject to fixed interest rates 
in addition  the amount of principal to be repaid at maturity is also fixed 
in the case of the convertible notes  such notes are based on fixed conversion ratios into common stock 
therefore  we are not subject to market risk from our debt instruments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  and we could become involved in intellectual property disputes 
our ability to effectively compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we hold a number of patents and other license rights 
these patent and license rights may not provide meaningful protection for our manufacturing processes and equipment innovations 
on june   solectron was served  along with other companies including smart modular technologies  inc  as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by the lemelson medical  education research foundation 
the lawsuit alleges that solectron has infringed certain of the plaintiff s patents relating to machine vision and bar code technology 
solectron believes it has meritorious defenses to these allegations and does not expect that this litigation will result in a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in the future  third parties may assert infringement claims against solectron or its customers 
in the event of an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop a non infringing alternative or to obtain licenses 
we may not be successful in developing such an alternative or obtaining a license on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  any such litigation could be lengthy and costly and could harm our financial condition 
failure to comply with environmental regulations could harm our business 
as a company in the electronics manufacturing services industry  we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
although we have never sustained any significant loss as a result of noncompliance with such regulations  any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant costs to comply with regulations 
our stock price may be volatile due to factors outside of our control 
our stock price could fluctuate due to the following factors  among others announcements of operating results and business conditions by our customers  announcements by our competitors relating to new customers or technological innovation or new services  economic developments in the electronics industry as a whole  political and economic developments in countries in which we have operations  and general market conditions 
failure to retain key personnel and skilled associates could hurt our operations 
our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical associates 
losing the services of key personnel could harm us 
our business also depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain senior managers and skilled associates 
failure to do so could harm our operations 
year problems may have an adverse effect on our operations and ability to offer products and services without interruption 
the year issue is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have this date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  order materials or otherwise engage in normal business activities 
a key to our ability to successfully manage our operations is the responsiveness of the supply chain for electronics components 
this supply chain is often controlled by computer systems  which could fail 
while solectron controls some of these systems  our vendors  our customers  transportation companies and other service providers that are outside of solectron s control operate some of these computer systems  as well 
if any of these computer systems fail  it could delay our receipt of previously ordered electronics components  thereby causing us to delay  cancel or modify orders from our customers  which could harm our business 
we have developed a contingency plan to address the year problem 
this contingency plan may still not be successful in preventing a disruption of our operations 
although we have extensively tested our equipment and interfaces with other companies  we cannot be sure that this testing will fully replicate the actual situation when the year arrives 
our anti takeover defense provisions may deter potential acquirors and may depress our stock price 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of solectron 
these provisions allow us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock and impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for our stockholders to effect certain corporate actions
