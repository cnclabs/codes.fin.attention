as crescendo s funds are utilized under the development agreement and to pay the technology fee  lower cash balances will be available for investment and  therefore  interest and investment income is expected to continue to decrease 
prior to alza s introduction of ditropan xl  crescendo did not anticipate revenues other than from interest and investment income 
under the terms of the license agreement between crescendo and alza for oros oxybutynin  crescendo will receive payments from alza based on worldwide net sales of the product 
for the first three years the rates will be   and of net sales  respectively  thereafter the rate is expected to be between and  based on the development costs of the product to date and anticipated development costs to be paid by crescendo 
however  there can be no assurance that revenue relating to commercialized crescendo products will be sufficient in the future to support crescendo s operations once the available funds are exhausted  or that crescendo products under development will receive regulatory clearance or will be successfully commercialized 
crescendo s research and development expenses increased to approximately million in  compared to approximately million for the period from inception june  through december  the substantial increase in reflects the first full year of operation 
for the period from inception june  through december   crescendo incurred research and development expenses of approximately million

income taxes payable for the year ended december  resulted from capitalization of research expenses for income taxes purposes only 
in its early years  the results of operations of crescendo are expected to reflect primarily interest and investment income on the funds contributed by alza  and research and development expenses related to development of crescendo products and the technology fee 
crescendo s net loss for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share from inception june  through december  the substantial increase reflects crescendo s first full year of operations 
crescendo is expected to continue to incur significant net losses in the next two years  as product development expenses under its agreements with alza are expected to continue to exceed investment income and royalty payments 
year readiness crescendo is reliant upon the quickbooks pro version software application to record its business activities 
this accounting software has been represented by the manufacturer to be year compliant 
in addition to its internal system  crescendo is also reliant upon the capabilities of the computer systems of its vendors  contractors including alza for administrative functions under the services agreement and for contractual research and development  us government agencies  and its investment managers 
in order to determine the level of year compliance of vendors  contractors and investment managers  crescendo has initiated communications with third parties  including alza  with whom it has material direct business relationships 
if any of these third parties experience failures in their computer systems due to year non compliance  it could materially affect crescendo s investment portfolio  ability to engage in normal business activities and  in particular  the status of certain product development activities being conducted by alza 
although these risks are outside of crescendo s control  crescendo will continue to assess the responses it receives from third parties in an effort to address any potential non compliance issues 
alza has advised crescendo that its operations are largely year compliant  and that it expects to be fully compliant by the end of crescendo has not incurred any material costs in connection with its year assessment and no conversion of its internal system is required 
due to the general uncertainty surrounding the year readiness of third parties upon whom crescendo relies  crescendo is unable to determine at this time whether or to what extent year failures will have a material impact on its operations 
liquidity and capital resources on september   alza contributed million in cash to crescendo in exchange for the crescendo shares 
on september   alza distributed the crescendo shares to holders of alza common stock and alza s outstanding convertible subordinated debentures  and crescendo commenced operations 
the funds contributed by alza  plus investment income earned thereon  are being used primarily to fund the development of crescendo products and to conduct related activities 
funds not immediately required for development activities are invested in low risk securities 
at december   crescendo had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
as crescendo s funds continue to be utilized under the development agreement and to pay the technology fee to alza  increasingly lower cash balances will be available for investment 
based on anticipated spending levels for the continued development of all crescendo products currently under development  it is expected that crescendo s funds for product development will be exhausted within the next two years 
at that time  product development funding by crescendo will cease 
however  several factors could impact the level and timing of crescendo funding  including the addition of any new crescendo products  the discontinuation of the development of any crescendo products  any commercial arrangements between alza and other companies which would cause alza to exercise its license option with respect to any crescendo product  any change in the number of projects advancing to or continuing in later stages of development or any adjustments in the rate of spending on products currently in development 
when crescendo s available funds are exhausted  certain critical timetables will be triggered 
first  alza s purchase option will terminate on the th day after crescendo provides alza with a statement that  as of the end of any calendar month  there are less than million of available funds remaining  accompanied by a report of crescendo s independent auditors 
in addition  alza has the right  for days after expiration of the purchase option  to license any or all crescendo products which have not yet been licensed  on a product by product and country by country basis 
alza is under no obligation to exercise the purchase option  or the license option with respect to any or all crescendo products  and will do so only if alza determines that it is in the best interests of alza and its stockholders at the time the decision is made 
in the event that alza does not exercise the purchase option  or the license option for all crescendo products  after available funds are exhausted  crescendo will not have funds to continue or complete development of any remaining crescendo products 
it is not likely that crescendo would be able to raise any additional funds during the period when alza s purchase option is outstanding  because of the existence of such option 
after the expiration of the purchase option  if it is not exercised  crescendo s ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to the perception of those investors with funds available  or the public markets  of the value of crescendo s portfolio
