item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations some of the matters discussed in this annual report contain forward looking statements regarding the company s future business which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including competitive pressures  adverse economic conditions and government regulations 
these issues  and other factors  which may be identified from time to time in the company s reports filed with the sec  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
results of operations summary of results of operations the company s net earnings for the year ended december  were million  compared to net earnings of million in and million in years ended december dollars in millions  except per share data earnings before income taxes and extraordinary gain income tax expense extraordinary gain on debt redemption net of tax net earnings net earnings per common share basic 


net earnings per common share diluted 


the decline in the company s earnings before income taxes and extraordinary gain is primarily due to several material charges incurred in these charges include million associated with write offs of computer equipment and development costs  million for deletion of excess or slow moving inventory and million in severance and related costs 
in addition  costs associated with the implementation of the company s strategic initiatives continue to unfavorably impact short term profits see operating  selling  general and administrative expenses 
management strategies since  the company has been committed to several key strategies that it believes  over the long term  will provide further differentiation from competitors and allow eleven to maintain its position as the premier convenience retailer 
these strategies include upgrading and expanding the store base  a customer driven approach to product selection  an everyday fair pricing policy on all items  daily delivery of fresh perishable items  introduction of high quality  ready to eat fresh foods  and the implementation of a state of the art retail information system 
prior to  the company focused on upgrading its store base  through remodeling existing stores and closing underachieving stores 
in late  the company completed the most extensive remodeling program in its history 
current upgrade programs will focus on retail information systems  food service and other merchandising programs 
beginning in late  the company began to focus its efforts on growing its store base 
the company recorded the first increase in its total store base in years in store openings or acquisitions over the last three years totaled  and in  and  respectively 
store growth in was aided by acquisitions of christy s market convenience stores and red d mart stores 
also  an additional stores were under construction at december  in  new store openings are once again expected to outpace closings  with the expansion occurring in existing markets to enhance the economies of scale associated with the company s fresh food and combined distribution initiatives 
in recent years  the company has pruned its store base  closing or disposing of those stores that either could not support its strategies  were not expected to achieve an acceptable level of profitability in the future or had leases which expired 
as a result  store closings during the past three years totaled  and in  and  respectively 
the company expects to close slightly fewer stores in than it did in the store additions and closings discussed above include relocations  rebuilds and seasonal activity 
the customer driven approach to merchandising focuses on providing the customer a selection of quality products at a good value 
this is being accomplished by emphasizing the importance of ordering at the store level  removing slow moving items and aggressively introducing new  high potential products in the early stages of their life cycle 
this process represents an ongoing effort to satisfy customers ever changing preferences 
the company s everyday fair pricing strategy is designed to provide consistent reasonable prices on all items 
when the everyday fair pricing strategy was introduced  some product prices were lowered  while others were increased to achieve more consistency 
going forward  as the company achieves lower product costs  it plans to migrate toward lower retail prices 
daily delivery of high quality  ready to eat foods  along with other time sensitive or perishable items  is another key management strategy 
implementation of this strategy includes third party development and operation of combined distribution centers cdc  fresh food commissaries and bakery facilities in many of the company s markets around the country 
the commissary and bakery ready to eat items  like fresh sandwiches and pastries  along with goods from multiple vendors such as dairy products  bread  produce and other perishable goods  are combined at a distribution center and delivered daily to each store 
in addition to providing fresher products  improved in stock conditions and quicker response time on new items  the combined distribution is also intended to provide lower product costs  in part from vendors savings  through this approach 
at the end of  approximately  stores were serviced by daily distribution facilities 
expansion of these programs to another stores is anticipated in the development of a retail information system ris began in the initial phase  completed in early  involved installing in store processors isp in each store to automate accounting and other store level tasks 
the current phase involves the installation of point of sale registers with scanning capabilities  as well as tools on the isp to assist with ordering and product assortment  and a hand held unit for ordering product from the sales floor 
at the end of  point of sale registers had been installed in nearly  stores in either a live or training mode 
after completion  the system will provide each store  along with the company s suppliers and distributors  on line information to make better decisions in anticipating customer needs 
management believes that the effective utilization of daily sales data gathered by the system will improve sales through reducing out of stock incidents and will enhance each individual store s product mix to better match customers needs 
in addition  the system will assist with monitoring inventories to better control shortage and product write offs 
while implementation costs during the rollout phase are expected to exceed the short term benefits  the anticipated long term benefits of this system  coupled with further cost reductions resulting from automation  are expected to help the company reach its goal of sustained profitable growth over the long term 
this phase of the system is currently expected to be fully operational for all stores by the fall of except where noted  all per store numbers refer to an average of all stores rather than only stores open more than one year 
sales the company recorded net sales of billion for the year ended december   compared to sales of billion in and billion in the increase in net sales over the last two years was a result of same store merchandise sales growth  combined with an increase in stores 
the following table illustrates the growth in merchandise sales merchandise sales growth data per store years ended december increase decrease from prior year us same store sales growth us same store real sales growth  excluding inflation eleven inflation the fourth quarter of was the sixth consecutive quarter of favorable us same store real sales growth  the longest stretch this decade 
same store merchandise sales growth was over the last six months  which is also the largest such increase this decade 
the company believes that this trend is  in part  a result of changes made to the merchandising organization and its processes in the second quarter of while average per store merchandise sales growth has been fairly consistent among the various geographical areas  category results have been mixed categories with significant merchandise sales increases were cigarettes  cafe cooler  fresh foods bakery  coffee  prepaid phone cards and slurpee 
cigarette sales increased primarily due to retail price increases associated with manufacturer cost increases  which have had an unfavorable impact on margin 
cafe cooler  a frozen non carbonated drink introduced in the spring  provided incremental growth in per store sales 
slurpee and non carbonated drink sales are up substantially  partially due to the introduction of new products  flavors and packaging 
the company has plans to revitalize certain mature categories like soft drinks fountain and candy  which have had declining sales over the last couple of years 
other categories which had slight declines in include newspapers publications and packaged bakery bread 
categories driving the merchandise sales increase were coffee  slurpee  non carbonated beverages  tobacco  services  fresh bakery and roller grill products 
categories that were flat or had slight declines included fountain drinks  bread  candy and soft drinks 
during  the company s retail price of gasoline dropped cents per gallon  or 
as a result  gasoline sales dollars per store decreased in  compared to  after a decline of in versus gas gallon sales per store increased when compared to  primarily due to new store volumes  which are higher than existing stores 
contributing to the decrease was a 
decline in average per store gallon volume with retail gasoline prices being virtually flat compared to other income other income of million for was million higher than and million higher than the improvement over the last two years is a combination of increased royalty income from licensed operations  combined with fees generated from higher levels of franchising activity 
in  nearly million of the royalties were from area license agreements with sej 
one year following repayment of the company s yen denominated loan  currently projected for  royalty payments from sej will be reduced by approximately two thirds in accordance with terms of the license agreement 
gross profits merchandise gross profit data years ended december merchandise gross profit dollars in millions    gross margin profit percent increase decrease from prior year all stores average per store gross profit dollar change margin percentage point change 


average per store merchandise sales the improvement in total merchandise gross profit dollars  compared to  was due to a combination of higher per store sales and more stores  as the margin percentage decreased basis points 
total merchandise gross profit dollars increased in from both higher average per store sales and a higher margin 
merchandise margin declined in primarily due to product cost increases and continuing refinement of the company s everyday fair pricing strategy 
merchandise margin was also impacted by introductory costs associated with new product offerings  combined with the further rollout of the company s fresh food initiatives into four new markets 
more aggressive retail pricing continues to present a challenge in today s increasingly more competitive environment 
although overall merchandise margin declined  several categories impacted margin favorably  including cafe cooler  commissions services and coffee 
management is actively working to improve merchandise margin while providing fair and consistent prices 
the increase in merchandise margin in was primarily due to improved sales in some higher margin categories like slurpee  coffee  non carbonated beverages and services 
these increases were partially offset by higher write offs  as the company focused on expanding its fresh food program  both geographically and with new products 
cigarettes currently contribute nearly of the company s total merchandise sales and more than of merchandise gross profit 
with the recent and pending legal settlements between cigarette manufacturers and several state governments  as well as potential additional taxes and litigation threatened by the federal government  the company anticipates that the cost of cigarettes could continue to rise 
additionally  there are numerous examples of pending state and federal legislation aimed at reducing minors consumption of tobacco products  which include significant increases in cigarette taxes 
although the company expects merchandise margin percent to be negatively impacted by these price increases  it is impossible to predict the impact potential cost increases could have on the company s gross profit dollars  due to uncertainties regarding competitors reactions and consumers buying habits 
gasoline gross profit data years ended december gasoline gross profit dollars in millions gross profit margin in cents per gallon increase decrease from prior year average per store gross profit dollar change margin point change in cents per gallon 


average per store gas gallonage 

gasoline gross profits improved million in over this improvement was due to more gas stores  higher average per store gas gallonage and a favorable change in cents per gallon gross profit 
in general  market conditions created a situation where the wholesale cost of gasoline was significantly lower than in either or these conditions helped ease the competitive pressures that had been narrowing margins over the previous two years 
in  gasoline gross profits declined million from the levels achieved in excluding the stores on the west coast  the company s gasoline gross profits increased million in compared to this increase was comprised of a slight improvement in average per store gallons and an increase in the number of gas stores 
the stores on the west coast of the company s total gas stores were impacted by industry product supply problems and intense competitive conditions  creating a situation where  in some cases  the company s cost exceeded other operators retail price of gasoline 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses osg a years ended december dollars in millions total operating  selling  general and administrative expenses    ratio of osg a to sales increase decrease in osg a compared to prior year the ratio of osg a expenses to sales increased percentage points in  compared to this increase is primarily due to a decline of cents per gallon in s retail price of gasoline 
adjusting for comparable gasoline prices  the ratio of osg a to sales was flat  when compared to the increase in osg a expense over levels was partially due to charges of million associated with write offs of computer equipment and development costs and million in severance and related costs 
other factors impacting osg a were increased store labor costs  a higher amount of gross profits shared with the franchisees due to higher gross profits earned by franchisees  costs associated with operating additional stores and more environmental expenses 
in addition  osg a expenses increased due to the company s implementation of its retail information system and other strategic initiatives 
expenses associated with the company s retail information system were approximately million higher in than in while the ratio of osg a expenses to sales will vary on a quarterly basis  management believes this ratio will not improve significantly during the rollout phase of the retail information system 
the increase in osg a expenses  and the ratio to sales  in compared to  was primarily the result of the following factors incremental costs related to the retail information system initiatives  higher store labor costs due to a tight labor market and increases in the minimum wage rate  more depreciation expense due to the extensive remodeling program completed in late  completion of new stores and other initiatives  more environmental remediation  and higher store insurance due to the comparison with favorable claims experience reflected in the company continues to review the functions necessary to enable its stores to respond faster and more cost efficiently to rapidly changing customer needs and preferences 
in conjunction with this review  management continues to realign and reduce personnel in order to eliminate non essential costs  while devoting resources to the implementation of its retail information system and other strategic initiatives see management strategies 
during  accruals of million were made representing severance benefits for close to management and administrative employees whose positions have been  or will be terminated 
the benefit from these reductions on an annualized basis approximates the charge  with the majority of the benefit carrying forward to future years 
the company is a defendant in two legal actions  which are referred to as the eleven offf and valente cases  filed by franchisees in and  respectively  asserting various claims against the company 
a nationwide settlement was negotiated and  in connection with the settlement  these two cases have been combined on behalf of a class of all persons who operated eleven convenience stores in the united states at any time between january  and july   under franchise agreements with the company 
class members have overwhelmingly approved the settlement  and the court presiding over the settlement process gave its final approval of the settlement on april  the settlement provides that former franchisees will share in a settlement fund and that certain changes will be made to the franchise agreements with current franchisees 
notices of appeal of the order approving the settlement were filed on behalf of three of the attorneys who represented the class  six former franchisees and two current franchisees 
one of these current franchisees has dismissed his appeal 
the settlement agreement will not become effective until the appeals are resolved 
however  the settlement agreement provides that while the appeals are pending the company will pay certain maintenance and supply expenses relating to the cash registers and retail information system equipment of current franchisees that are members of the settlement class 
if the settlement is overturned on appeal  the company has the right to require franchisees to repay the amounts that the company paid for these expenses while the appeals were pending 
the company s payment of these expenses had no material impact on earnings and should have no material impact on future earnings 
the company s accruals are sufficient to cover the total settlement costs  including the payment due to former franchisees when the settlement becomes effective 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased million in  compared to this increase is primarily due to a higher average debt balance in  combined with the redemption of a portion of the company s public debt securities see extraordinary gain which were accounted for under sfas no 
see discussion below  partially offset by the write off of deferred costs associated with the company s refinancing of its credit agreement in february approximately of the company s debt contains floating rates that will be unfavorably impacted by rising interest rates 
nearly of the company s floating rate debt exposure to rising interest rates has been eliminated as a result of an interest rate swap agreement see interest rate swap agreement 
the weighted average interest rate for such debt  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  was for versus for both and the company expects net interest expense in to increase approximately over based on anticipated levels of debt and interest rate projections 
factors increasing interest expense include higher borrowings to finance new store development and other initiatives  combined with the redemption of million of the company s public debt securities in and early  which were accounted for under sfas no 
see extraordinary gain 
in accordance with sfas no 
 no interest expense is recognized on the company s public debt securities 
these securities were recorded at an amount equal to the future undiscounted cash payments  both principal and interest  and accordingly  the cash interest payments are charged against the recorded amount of such securities and are not treated as interest expense 
accordingly  interest expense on debt used to redeem public debt securities would increase the company s reported interest expense 
net interest expense decreased slightly in compared to due to lower average borrowing throughout the year  partially offset by lower interest income 
the lower interest income was primarily the result of a new money order agreement in that eliminated interest income from the funding arrangement  however  it provided lower cost of goods and operating costs  which more than offset the impact of the lost interest 
interest rate swap agreement in june  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed the interest rate on million notional principal amount of existing floating rate debt at through june a major financial institution  as counterparty to the agreement  agreed to pay the company a floating interest rate based on three month libor during the term of the agreement in exchange for the company paying a fixed interest rate 
the impact on net interest expense for the fourth quarter and for was nominally favorable as a result of this agreement 
the swap agreement granted the counterparty the option  upon expiration of the initial swap term  of extending the agreement for an additional five years at a fixed interest rate of 
this option component of the agreement was recognized at fair value and was marked to market 
due to declining interest rates  the company recognized osg a expense related to the option component of million in the fourth quarter and million for in february  the company amended the terms of the interest rate swap agreement 
the fixed rate was increased to and the term of the swap was extended to february  the remaining terms of the swap agreement were unchanged 
in exchange for the increase in the fixed rate  the five year extension option held by the counterparty was terminated 
income taxes the company recorded tax expense in from earnings before extraordinary gain of million  compared to expense of million in and million in the decrease in income tax expense  compared to  resulted from lower earnings before tax  in large part due to charges discussed in the summary of results of operations section 
the extraordinary gain was net of million of tax expense 
higher income tax expense in  when compared to  was due to a settlement of an irs tax examination  resulting in a million tax benefit in extraordinary gain during  the company redeemed million of its public debt securities resulting in a million after tax gain 
the gain resulted from the retirement of future undiscounted interest payments as recorded under sfas no 
 combined with repurchasing a portion of the debentures below their face amount 
as a result of the redemptions  the face amount of the debentures has been reduced by the following of the second priority senior subordinated debentures  of the first priority senior subordinated debentures  of the second priority senior subordinated debentures series a and of the second priority senior subordinated debentures series b 
the company s cash outlay  including fees  was million  which was financed through the issuance of million of convertible quarterly income debt securities quids due the quids were issued to ito yokado co  ltd 
and seven eleven japan co  ltd  the joint owners of iyg holding company  the company s majority shareholder 
in the first quarter of  the company redeemed an additional million of its public debt securities resulting in a million after tax gain 
liquidity and capital resources the majority of the company s working capital is provided from three sources i cash flows generated from its operating activities  ii a million commercial paper facility guaranteed by ito yokado co  ltd  and iii short term seasonal borrowings of up to million reduced by outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility 
the company believes that operating activities  coupled with available short term working capital facilities  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund current commitments for operating and capital expenditure programs  as well as to service debt requirements 
actual capital expenditure funding will be dependent on the level of cash flow generated from operating activities and the funds available from financings 
in january  the company expanded the existing commercial paper facility from million to million 
the commercial paper is unsecured but is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ito yokado co  ltd 
in april  the company entered into a financing agreement for billion yen  or million  monetizing a portion of its future yen royalty stream 
the financing  which bears interest at  is secured by a pledge secondary to the yen denominated loan of the future royalty payments from seven eleven japan associated with the company s japanese eleven trademarks 
payment of principal and interest on the debt is non recourse to the company and will commence when the yen denominated loan is paid in full  which is currently estimated to be in it is anticipated that this loan will be fully repaid in in february  the company issued million of quids  which is subordinated to all existing debt except the convertible quarterly income debt securities due  which have the same priority ranking 
the debt has a year life  no amortization and an interest rate of 
the instrument gives the company the right to defer interest payments thereon for up to consecutive quarters 
the debt mandatorily converts into  shares of the company s common stock if the price of the company s common stock achieves certain levels after the third anniversary of issuance 
a portion of the proceeds from the quids was used to redeem a portion of the company s public debt securities 
southland s credit agreement  established in february  includes a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility  which has a sublimit of million for letters of credit credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and operating covenants requiring  among other things  the maintenance of certain financial ratios  including interest and rent coverage  fixed charge coverage and senior indebtedness to net earnings before extraordinary items and interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the covenant levels established by the credit agreement generally require continuing improvement in the company s financial condition 
in march  the financial covenant levels required by these instruments were amended prospectively in order to allow the company flexibility to continue its store growth strategy 
in connection with this amendment  the interest rate on borrowings was changed to a reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus 
instead of the previous increment of 
for the period ended december   the company was in compliance with all of the covenants required under the credit agreement  including compliance with the principal financial and operating covenants under the credit agreement calculated over the latest month period as follows requirements covenants actuals minimum maximum interest and rent coverage to to fixed charge coverage to to senior indebtedness to ebitda to to capital expenditure limit tested annually million million includes effects of the sfas no

in  the company repaid million of debt of which million related to the redemption of the company s subordinated debentures see extraordinary gain and million was for debt assumed in the christy s acquisition see capital expenditures acquisitions 
the remaining principal reduction of million included million for quarterly installments due on the term loan  million for principal payments on the company s yen denominated loan secured by the royalty income stream from sej  million for sfas no 
interest and million on capital leases 
outstanding balances at december   for commercial paper  term loan and revolver  were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the credit agreement totaled million 
cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million in and million in contributing to the decline in cash provided by operating activities in  when compared to  was an increase in inventories  caused by a december cigarette buy in and generally higher per store inventory levels 
capital expenditures in  net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of payments of million for property and equipment and million for acquisitions see capital expenditures acquisitions 
the majority of the property and equipment capital was used for new store development  continued implementation of the company s retail information system  remodeling stores  new equipment to support merchandising initiatives  upgrading retail gasoline facilities  replacing equipment and complying with environmental regulations 
the company expects capital expenditures  excluding lease commitments  to exceed million 
capital expenditures are being used to develop or acquire new stores  upgrade store facilities  further implement the retail information system  replace equipment  upgrade gasoline facilities and comply with environmental regulations 
the amount of expenditures during the year will be materially impacted by the proportion of new store development funded through capital expenditures versus leases and the speed at which new sites acquisitions can be located  negotiated  permitted and constructed 
capital expenditures acquisitions in may  the company purchased all of the capital stock of christy s market  inc  of brockton  mass  thereby acquiring christy s market convenience stores  located in the new england area 
also in may  the company purchased the assets of red d mart convenience stores in the south bend  indiana  area from mdk corporation of goshen  indiana 
capital expenditures gasoline equipment the company incurs ongoing costs to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations primarily relating to underground storage tank ust systems 
the company does not anticipate any capital improvements required to comply with environmental regulations relating to usts as well as above ground vapor recovery equipment at store locations  but will spend approximately million on such capital improvements from through environmental in december  the company closed its chemical manufacturing facility in new jersey 
the company is required to conduct environmental remediation at the facility  including groundwater monitoring and treatment for a projected year period 
this remediation program will commence in with the performance of certain engineering and design work 
the company has recorded undiscounted liabilities representing its best estimates of the clean up costs of million at december  in  the company and the former owner of the facility entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the former owner agreed to pay a substantial portion of the clean up costs 
based on the terms of the settlement agreement and the financial resources of the former owner  the company has a receivable recorded of million at december  additionally  the company accrues for the anticipated future costs and the related probable state reimbursement amounts for remediation activities at its existing and previously operated gasoline sites where releases of regulated substances have been detected 
at december   the company s estimated undiscounted liability for these sites was million 
this estimate is based on the company s prior experience with gasoline sites and its consideration of such factors as the age of the tanks  location of tank sites and experience with contractors who perform environmental assessment and remediation work 
the company anticipates that substantially all of the future remediation costs for detected releases at these sites as of december   will be incurred within the next four to five years 
under state reimbursement programs  the company is eligible to receive reimbursement for a portion of future remediation costs  as well as a portion of remediation costs previously paid 
accordingly  at december   the company has recorded a net receivable of million for the estimated probable state reimbursements 
in assessing the probability of state reimbursements  the company takes into consideration each state s fund balance  revenue sources  existing claim backlog  status of clean up activity and claim ranking systems 
as a result of these assessments  the recorded receivable amount is net of an allowance of million 
while there is no assurance of the timing of the receipt of state reimbursement funds  based on its experience  the company expects to receive the majority of state reimbursement funds  except from california  within one to three years after payment of eligible remediation expenses  assuming that the state administrative procedures for processing such reimbursements have been fully developed 
the company estimates that it may take one to six years to receive reimbursement funds from california 
therefore  the portion of the recorded receivable amount that relates to sites where remediation activities have been conducted has been discounted at to reflect their present value 
thus  the recorded receivable amount is also net of a discount of million 
the estimated future assessment and remediation expenditures and related state reimbursement amounts could change within the near future as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be implemented or revised 
environmental acquisitions both the red d mart and christy s market acquisitions include retail gasoline outlets that are subject to certain environmental regulations 
under the terms of the acquisition agreements  the sellers are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable environmental regulations existing as of the closing date 
in addition  the acquisition agreements provide that the sellers will remain responsible for the expense of any future environmental cleanup  which is required under applicable legal requirements and which results from conditions existing at the sites see capital expenditures acquisitions 
year the year issue yk is the result of computer software programs being coded to use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
some of the company s older computer programs that have date sensitive coding may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations  causing disruptions of operations 
the company has approached the yk issue in phases 
a year project office manager  together with a strong support organization  has designed a yk work plan that is currently being implemented 
the yk work plan includes identifying and inventorying all year tasks and items  assigning priorities to all tasks and items  remediation of information systems is applications code  testing and reintegration to production  as well as testing all replaced systems software and non remediated applications  contacting third party vendors to verify their compliance and perform selected interface tests with major vendors  determining the company s yk responsibilities to its franchisees  subsidiaries and affiliates  establishing contingency alternatives assuming worst case scenarios 
the company continues to progress favorably in its completion of the various tasks and target dates identified in the yk work plan 
the company believes it has identified and prioritized all major yk related items 
in addition  numerous non is  merchandise  equipment  financial institution  insurance and public utility vendors have been contacted  inquiring as to their readiness and the readiness of their respective vendors 
at this time the company is performing follow up efforts with the above vendors as required 
testing compliance with major vendors is now being planned and is scheduled to begin june  the following reflects management s assessment of the company s year state of readiness state of readiness as of december  estimated estimated phase percent complete completion date internal is and non is systems and equipment awareness dec 
assessment changes required march remediation or replacement june testing sept 
contingency planning june suppliers  customers and third party providers awareness identify companies april assessment questionnaire completed by major suppliers may assessment review with third party providers may review contractual commitments june risk assessment may contingency planning june testing as applicable sept 
indicates work should be significantly finished at the estimated completion date  but the company will continue to reevaluate awareness  send follow up questionnaires and update contingency plans as needed 
the company estimates that the cost of the year project will be approximately million  of which about million will be capital costs 
the costs incurred to date are million  with the remaining cost for outside consultants  software and hardware applications to be funded through operating cash flow 
this estimate includes costs related to the upgrade and or replacement of computer software and hardware  costs of remediated code testing and test result verification  and the reintegration to production of all remediated applications 
in addition  the costs include the testing of applications and software currently certified as year compliant 
the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the yk project  which are primarily the related payroll costs for the is and various user personnel participating in the project 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year process  primarily due to issues surrounding the yk readiness of third party suppliers and vendors  a reasonable worst case scenario is difficult to determine at this time 
the company does not anticipate more than temporary isolated disruptions attributed to year issues to affect either the company or its primary vendors 
the company is concentrating on four critical business areas in order to identify  evaluate and determine the scenarios requiring the development of contingency plans merchandise ordering and receipt  petroleum products ordering and receipt  human resource systems and disbursement systems 
to the extent vendors are unable to deliver products due to their own year issues  the company believes it will generally have alternative sources for comparable products and does not expect to experience any material business disruptions 
although considered unlikely  the failure of public utility companies to provide telephone and electrical service could have material consequences 
contingency planning efforts will escalate as the company continues to receive and evaluate responses from all of its primary merchandise vendors and service providers 
these contingency plans are scheduled to be complete by june the costs of the yk project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that these forward looking estimates will be achieved and the actual costs and vendor compliance could differ materially from the company s current expectations  resulting in a material financial risk 
in addition  while the company is making significant efforts in addressing all anticipated year risks within its control  this event is unprecedented and consequently there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
market sensitive instruments and risk management the following discussion summarizes the financial and derivative instruments held by the company at december   which are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the primary market exposures associated with underlying liabilities and anticipated transactions 
the company uses these instruments to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
in addition  the two yen denominated loans serve to effectively hedge the company s exposure to yen dollar currency fluctuations 
the instruments held by the company are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
there are no material quantitative changes in market risk exposure at december   when compared to december  in the normal course of business  the company also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not represented in this discussion 
interest rate risk management the table below presents descriptions of the floating rate financial instruments and interest rate derivative instruments held by the company at december  the company entered into an interest rate swap to achieve the appropriate level of variable and fixed rate debt as approved by senior management 
under the interest rate swap  the company agreed with other parties to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts on a quarterly basis 
for the debt  the table below presents principal cash flows that exist by maturity date and the related average interest rate 
for the swap  the table presents the notional amounts outstanding and expected interest rates that exist by contractual dates 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
the variable rates are estimated based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
additionally  the interest rate on the bank debt reflects a libor margin of basis points as prescribed in the credit agreement 
dollars in millions there after total fair value floating rate financial instruments bank debt commercial paper average interest rate interest rate derivatives notional amount average pay rate average receive rate the million fair value of the interest rate swap represents an estimate of the payment amount if the company chose to terminate the swap 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information on both floating and fixed rate liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for fair value and derivative discussions  including the mark to market adjustment relating to the unwinding of the swap s option component in february foreign exchange risk management the company recorded over million in royalty income in that was impacted by fluctuating exchange rates 
approximately of such royalties were from area license agreements with sej 
sej royalty income will not fluctuate with exchange rate movements since the company has effectively hedged this exposure by using the royalty income to make principal and interest payments on its yen denominated loans see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is exposed to fluctuating exchange rates on the non sej portion of its royalties earned in foreign currency  but based on current estimates  future risk is not material 
the company has several wholly or partially owned foreign subsidiaries and is susceptible to exchange rate risk on earnings from these subsidiaries 
based on current estimates  the company does not consider future foreign exchange risk associated with these subsidiaries to be material 
equity price risk management the company has equity securities  which are classified as available for sale and are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized as other comprehensive earnings  net of tax  as a separate component of shareholders equity 
at december   the company held the following available for sale marketable equity securities dollars in millions impact of change cost fair value in market price  shares of acs common stock  shares of precept common stock the affiliated computer services  inc stock acs was obtained in as partial consideration for southland to enter into a mainframe data processing contract with acs 
at the time  acs was a privately held start up company and accordingly the stock was valued with no cost 
subsequently acs became a public company and precept business services  inc precept was spun off from acs and also became a public company
