the company expects to continue to incur additional losses and will use its working capital as it incurs substantial expenses related to the targis system market development in the united states  clinical trials and research and development activities 
in addition  the company has commenced a program to rent targis system control units on a per procedure basis to customers 
depending on the success of this program  the company may use substantial capital to finance the units rented by customers 
although the company believes that existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next months  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing in the future or that any additional financing will be available to the company on satisfactory terms  if at all 
interest rate risk the fair value of the company s investment portfolio at june  approximated carrying value 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment portfolio and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
year issue many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept  store or report only two digit year entries in date code fields 
beginning in the year yk  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
the yk issue is a result of these programs being written with two digits instead of four 
as a result  computer systems and software used by companies  including urologix and its vendors and customers  will need to comply with the yk requirements 
the company is aware of the yk issue and has been proactive in addressing the issue internally and externally 
the company s primary software system is currently yk compliant 
the company does not depend on in house custom systems and generally purchases off the shelf software from reputable vendors who have tested their software for yk compliance 
the yk issue is being considered for all future software purchases 
although the company believes the yk issue will not pose material operational problems for its computer systems  there can be no assurance that problems arising from the yk issue will be completely eliminated 
the company is evaluating significant suppliers and large customers systems to determine the extent to which the company s interface with these systems is vulnerable to the yk issue 
this process is in progress and should be completed prior to urologix products are yk compliant and are able to operate in the year and beyond 
the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve yk issues in a timely manner 
the company also has contingency plans for certain critical applications and is working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing inventories and adjusting staffing strategies 
in the event that the company does not completely resolve all of the yk issues  the company s business operations could be adversely affected  although the resulting costs and loss of business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time
