year the inability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a two digit year is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
as the year approaches and thereafter  such systems may be unable to accurately process certain date based information 
this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in a variety of business activities 
the company has implemented a five step process to evaluate the impact of the year compliance issue 
these steps involve an inventory of company systems  an evaluation and analysis of systems regarding the year compliance impact  implementation of modifications to specified systems  unit testing  and finally systems or integration testing to validate compliance 
the company relies upon third party vendors which supply goods and services to the company and  although the company has consulted with various vendors in order to minimize the risk of the year compliance issue  such third parties may be affected by the year compliance issue 
while the company believes its actions shall have the effect of ameliorating year risk  there can be no assurance that the company s internal systems or equipment or those of third parties on which the company relies will be year compliant in a timely manner or that the company s or third parties contingency plans will mitigate the effects of noncompliance 
the failure of the systems or equipment of the company or third parties could result in the reduction or suspension of the company s operations and could have a material adverse affect on the company
