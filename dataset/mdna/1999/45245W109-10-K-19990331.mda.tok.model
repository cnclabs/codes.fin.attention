item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis by our management is provided to identify certain significant factors which affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
overview and risk factors we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the research and development of therapeutic products for the treatment of selected cancers and cancer related disorders 
our products under development include i cancer therapeutics  ii cancer vaccines and iii inhibitors of angiogenesis 
since our inception in april  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and through collaborations with corporate partners and academic research and clinical institutions 
we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from our inception to december  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over each of the next several years 
the major sources of our working capital have been o the proceeds from the public and private sale of equity securities 
o the sale of the ida bonds by the nyida the proceeds of which have been used for the acquisition  construction and installation of our research and development facility in new york city 
o license fees 
o contract research and development fees 
o royalties from collaborative partners 
o interest earned on these funds 
substantially all of our products are in various stages of development  clinical studies or research 
substantially all our revenues were generated from license and research arrangements with collaborative partners 
our revenues under research and license agreements with corporate sponsors have fluctuated and are expected to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
similarly  our results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these variations have been  and are expected to be  based primarily on o the status of development of our various products 
o the time at which we enter into research and license agreements with corporate partners that provide for payments to us  and the timing of payments to us under these agreements 
o whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones 
o timely payment by our corporate partners of amounts payable to us 
o the addition or termination of research programs or funding support 
o the timing of sales by abbott  our partner in diagnostics  of products that use our technology  and the amount for which such products are sold 
o variations in the level of expenses related to our proprietary products during any given period 
our products are only in the development stage 
before we can commercialize our products and begin to sell them to generate revenues  they will need substantial additional development and clinical testing  which will cost a lot of money 
generally  to make a profit we will need to successfully develop  test  introduce and market our products 
it is not certain that any of our products will be successfully developed or that required regulatory approvals to commercialize them can be obtained 
further  even if we successfully develop a product  there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manufacture or market that product or that customers will buy it 
our products will require substantial additional development and clinical testing and investment prior to commercialization 
to achieve profitable operations  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop  introduce and market our products 
no assurance can be given that any of our product development efforts will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals can be obtained or that any products  if developed  will be successfully manufactured or marketed or achieve customer acceptance 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted of i  in research support from our partnership with american home in infectious disease vaccines  ii  in milestone revenue and  in research and support payments from our agreement with merck for bec  iii  in royalty revenue from our strategic alliance with abbott in diagnostics and iv  from a phase i small business innovation research grant from the national cancer institute for a program in cancer related angiogenesis 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted of i  in research support from our partnership with american home in infectious disease vaccines  ii  in milestone revenue and  in research and support payments from our agreement with merck for bec and iii  in milestone revenue and  in royalty revenue from our strategic alliance with abbott in diagnostics 
the decrease in revenues for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a decrease in milestone revenue which can vary widely from period to period depending upon the timing of the achievement of various research and development milestones for products under development 
operating  research and development expenses 
total operating expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
such amounts for both years ended december  and represented of total operating expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was partially attributable to i the costs associated with an agreement in principle for the supplemental further development and manufacture of clinical grade c to support ongoing and future human clinical trials  ii expenditures associated with additional staffing in the area of discovery research  iii the initiation of new supported research programs with academic institutions  iv the establishment of corporate in licensing arrangements and v expenditures in the functional areas of product development  manufacturing  clinical and regulatory affairs associated with c this increase was partially offset by the one time  non cash compensation expense recorded for the year ended december  in connection with the extension of the term of an officer s warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include administrative personnel costs  costs incurred in connection with pursuing arrangements with corporate partners and technology licensors  and expenses associated with applying for patent protection for our technology and products 
such expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflected i additional support staffing for the expanding research  development  clinical and manufacturing efforts of the company  particularly with respect to c and ii expenses associated with the pursuit of strategic corporate alliances and other corporate development expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods to support our planned increases in research  development  clinical and manufacturing efforts 
interest and other income and interest expense 
interest and other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the increased interest income earned from higher cash balances in our investment portfolio resulting from the private placement of series a preferred stock completed in december interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
interest expense for both periods primarily included i interest on an outstanding industrial development revenue bond issued in the ida bond with a principal amount of  ii interest recorded on capital lease obligations and iii interest recorded on a liability to pharmacia and upjohn inc pharmacia  for the reacquisition of the worldwide rights to a recombinant mutein form of interleukin il m as well as clinical material manufactured and supplied to us by pharmacia 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the i december repayment of an ida bond issued in the ida bond with a principal amount of  and ii february repayment of the remaining liability to pharmacia 
net losses 
we had net losses to common stockholders of  or per share for the year ended december  compared with  or per share for the year ended december  the increase in the net losses and per share net loss to common stockholders was due primarily to the factors noted above and the accrued dividends and incremental yield on the series a preferred shares 
years ended december  and december  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  revenue for the year ended december  consisted of i  in research support from our partnership with american home in infectious disease vaccines  ii  in milestone revenue and  in research and support payments from our agreement with merck for bec  and iii  in milestone payments and  in royalty revenue from our strategic alliance with abbott in diagnostics 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted of i  in research support from our partnership with american home in infectious disease vaccines  ii  in royalty revenue from our strategic alliance with abbott in diagnostics  and iii  in license fees from our cross licensing agreement with immunex for novel hematopoietic growth factors 
the increase in revenues for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to i our having achieved development milestones under our agreement with merck for bec  and ii our strategic alliance with abbott 
milestone revenue can vary widely from period to period depending upon the timing of the achievement of various research and development milestones for products under development 
operating  research and development expenses 
total operating expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
such amounts for the years ended december  and december  represented and  respectively  of total operating expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was partly attributable to i a one time  non cash compensation expense recorded in connection with the extension of the term of an officer s warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock  and ii costs associated with additional staffing  contract manufacturing and testing  and expenditures in the functional areas of product development  manufacturing and clinical and regulatory affairs associated with c  and iii growth in the area of discovery research for future product candidates 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include administrative personnel costs  costs incurred in connection with pursuing arrangements with corporate partners and technology licensors  and expenses associated with applying for patent protection for our technology and products 
such expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects i  non cash compensation expense recorded in connection with an option grant to one of our officers  and ii additional support staffing for our expanding research  development  clinical and manufacturing efforts  particularly with respect to c we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods to support planned increases in research and development 
interest and other income and interest expense 
interest and other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the increased interest income earned from higher cash balances in our investment portfolio resulting from the proceeds received from a public offering of our common stock completed in march and a private placement of series a preferred stock completed in december interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
interest expense for both periods primarily included i interest on two then outstanding ida bonds with an aggregate principal amount of   of which was repaid in december  and ii interest recorded on the liability to pharmacia  for the reacquisition of the worldwide rights to il m as well as clinical material manufactured and supplied to us by pharmacia 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the may exchange of debt for our common stock with the oracle group and one of our directors 
net losses 
we had net losses to common stockholders of  or per share for the year ended december   compared with  or per share for the year ended december  the year ended december  included a  or per share extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
this extraordinary loss resulted from the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash repayment of a  loan due the oracle group and a  long term note owed to one of our directors 
the decrease in the per share net loss to common stockholders is due primarily to the increased number of shares of our common stock outstanding as a result of the march public offering of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and short term securities available for sale of approximately  we have financed our operations since inception primarily through o the proceeds from the public and private sales of our equity securities 
o the sale of three issues of ida bonds through the nyida 
o license fees 
o contract research and development fees 
o royalties received under agreements with collaborative partners 
o interest earned on these funds 
since inception o public and private sales of equity securities in financing transactions have raised approximately  in net proceeds 
o the sale of the ida bonds in each of  and raised an aggregate of  the proceeds of which have been used for the acquisition  construction and installation of our research and development facility in new york city  and of which  is currently outstanding 
o we have earned approximately  from license fees  contract research and development fees and royalties from collaborative partners  including approximately  earned during the year ended december o we have earned approximately  in interest income  including approximately  earned during the year ended december  in april  we entered into an agreement in principle with a pharmaceutical manufacturer for the supplemental further development  production scale up and manufacture of our lead therapeutic product candidate  c  for use in human clinical trials 
services pursuant to this agreement commenced in april and are anticipated to conclude in october the total project cost is dm  or currently approximately  as of december   we had incurred a liability of approximately  for services provided under this agreement 
in october  we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with combichem to discover and develop novel small molecules against selected targets for the treatment of cancer 
at the same time as we entered into this agreement  we entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we purchased  shares of common stock of combichem  as adjusted  for a total purchase price of  the investment has been classified as a long term asset 
during the year ended december  we recorded an unrealized loss of  on this investment due to a reduction in the market value of the stock 
we deem this reduction in market value to be temporary and therefore  the unrealized loss was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we have obligations under various capital leases for certain laboratory  office and computer equipment and also certain building improvements primarily under a december financing agreement the financing agreement and an april financing agreement the financing agreement with finova technology finance  inc finova 
the financing agreement allowed us to finance the lease of equipment and make certain building and leasehold improvements to existing facilities involving amounts totalling approximately  each lease has a fair market value purchase option at the expiration of a month term 
pursuant to the financing agreement  we issued to finova a warrant expiring december  to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we recorded a non cash debt discount of approximately  in connection with this financing  which discount is being amortized over the month term of the first lease 
the financing agreement with finova expired in december and we utilized only  of the full  under the agreement 
in april  we entered into the financing agreement with finova totalling approximately  the terms of the financing agreement are substantially similar to the now expired financing agreement except that each lease has a month term 
as of december   we had entered into ten individual leases under both the financing agreement and the financing agreement aggregating a total cost of  and had  available under the financing agreement 
the financing agreement terminates on march  and we are in discussions regarding its extension for an additional day period 
we have spent and will continue to spend in the future substantial funds to continue the research and development of our products  conduct pre clinical and clinical trials  establish clinical scale and commercial scale manufacturing in our own facilities or in the facilities of others  and market our products 
we have entered into preliminary discussions with several major pharmaceutical companies regarding various alternatives concerning the funding of research and development for certain of our products 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in consummating any such alternatives 
such strategic alliances could include up front license fees plus milestone fees and revenue sharing 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving such alliances  nor can we predict the amount of funds which might be available to us if we entered into such alliances or the time at which such funds would be made available or the other terms of any such alliances 
in january  we completed the construction and commissioning of a new  square foot process development center at our somerville  new jersey facility at a cost of approximately  under our agreement with merck for c  we are taking the lead in developing  in consultation with merck  a production concept for a new manufacturing facility 
merck is providing us  subject to certain terms  with a million secured line of credit or guaranty for the build out of this facility 
we are reviewing whether to erect this facility adjacent to our current manufacturing facility in new jersey or at another location 
we rent our new york city facility under a lease which was scheduled to expire in march we renewed the entire lease for a term commencing as of january  through december and plan to retrofit the facility to better suit our needs at a cost of approximately  the ida bond in the outstanding principal amount of  becomes due in we will incur annual interest on the ida bond aggregating approximately  we have granted the nyida a security interest in substantially all facility equipment located in the new york facility to secure our obligations to the nyida under the ida bond 
the holders of the  shares of series a preferred shares are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at an annual rate of per share 
dividends accrue as of the issuance date of the series a preferred shares and are payable on the outstanding series a preferred shares in cash on december of each year beginning december  or at the time of conversion or redemption of the series a preferred shares on which the dividend is to be paid  whichever is sooner 
accrued dividends were  at december  total capital expenditures made during the year ended december  were  of such expenditures   have been reimbursed in accordance with the terms of the financing agreement with finova 
of the total capital expenditures made during year ended december    related to improving and equipping our manufacturing facility in new jersey 
the balance of capital additions was for leasehold improvements  equipment and computer related purchases for the corporate office and research laboratories in new york 
we expect that our existing capital resources should enable us to maintain our current and planned operations through march certain of our research and support payments from corporate partners have defined expiration dates during under these existing corporate partnerships  we expect to receive final research and support payments of approximately  which will be recognized through the third quarter of additionally  certain milestone payments are subject to attaining research and development milestones  many of which have not yet been achieved 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve these milestones 
our future working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to o progress of our research and development programs  pre clinical testing and clinical trials 
o our corporate partners fulfilling their obligations to us 
o timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals 
o timing and cost of manufacturing scale up and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
o level of resources that we devote to the development of marketing and sales capabilities 
o costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims 
o technological advances 
o status of competitors 
o our ability to maintain existing and establish new collaborative arrangements with other companies to provide funding to us to support these activities 
o costs of establishing both clinical scale and commercial scale manufacturing capacity in our facility and those of others 
in order to fund our capital needs after march  we will require significant levels of additional capital and we intend to raise the capital through additional arrangements with corporate partners  equity or debt financings or from other sources including the proceeds of product sales  if any 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly curtail our planned operations 
uncertainties associated with the length and expense of pre clinical and clinical testing of any of our product candidates could greatly increase the cost of development of such products and affect the timing of any anticipated revenues from product sales 
our failure to obtain regulatory approval for any product will preclude its commercialization 
in addition  our failure to obtain patent protection for our products may make certain of our products commercially unattractive 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which expire at various dates from through at december  we had research credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various dates between years and pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the annual utilization of a company s net operating loss and research credit carryforwards may be limited if the company experiences a change in ownership of more than percentage points within a three year period 
since  we experienced two ownership changes 
accordingly  our net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future federal taxable income arising before such ownership changes are limited to  annually 
similarly  we are restricted in using our research credit carryforwards arising before such ownership changes to offset future federal income tax expense 
year the year problem involves mainly the inability of certain computer programs and microprocessing devices to differentiate between the year and the year because two digit rather than four digit fields were used to identify the year 
there are a variety of related date problems  including the use by older programs and devices of algorithms that will fail to correctly identify the year and certain other years in the twenty first century as leap years 
a year problem could cause a computer system or microprocessor that is date sensitive to malfunction  resulting in system failures 
such failures could cause disruptions of our operations  including  without limitation  the systems in place at our branchburg clinical scale manufacturing facility  computers  communication devices and laboratory instrumentation and systems which use dated information in our research and development and scientific testing or  possibly  in our pre clinical or clinical trials 
to deal with the year problem we have developed a year program that has three main phases i review of information technology it and non it systems for the purposes of assessing the potential impact of year on our business and identifying non year compliant systems  ii remediation and development of contingency plans  and iii testing 
these phases are not necessarily sequential 
we have a year team to coordinate and carry out the various phases and reporting responsible persons in each critical area  including computer hardware  software  other hardware  laboratory equipment  collaborators and process clinical development 
while we believe that our program is and will be adequate to address year problems  there can be no assurance that our operations will not be adversely affected 
while we have devoted significant resources to dealing with the year problem  our efforts to date have not caused the deferral of any other significant it projects 
we have completed phase one with regard to our own systems 
we reviewed the potential impact of the yk bug on our research and development  product development  manufacturing  financial  communication and administrative operations 
we determined which systems are critical to our business 
we also determined which systems were non year compliant 
as for the second phase  we are in the process of remediating through corrective programming modifications or system replacement all mission critical systems that we identified as non compliant 
we estimate that this process is complete and that it will be finished by june  in addition  for systems that we have identified as non mission critical  we also intend to either correct them through programming changes or replace them with compliant software and any necessary hardware or  possibly  simply discontinue using the system 
we have already developed testing protocols and have begun testing for all mission critical systems and have completed approximately of the testing we currently anticipate 
we expect to have completed testing of all mission critical systems no later than june  we are also in the process of testing other systems  and expect to have completed that process no later than june  the company estimates the cost of its year program to be approximately  of which approximately  has been spent through december  this includes the purchase of third party software and required hardware to run such software as well as the cost of modifying software 
this estimate is management s good faith estimate based on a variety of contingency assessments and is subject to change 
such expenditures will be funded from the company s internal resources 
in addition to the review of internal systems  we have identified and begun to make inquiries of our critical suppliers  corporate partners  manufacturers  clinical study sites  service suppliers  communications providers  lessor utilities  and banks whose system failures or non compliant products could have an adverse impact on our operations 
we expect to complete the identification and assessment process for such entities prior to june  while we are not currently aware of any material year problems involving such entities that are likely to adversely affect us  there can be no assurance that there will not be such problems or that  if discovered  they will be timely remediated 
we are in the process of developing contingency plans to deal with possible disruptions of important operations such as discovery research  product development  manufacturing and ongoing clinical trials 
such disruptions could affect the development and ultimate marketing of potential products as well as put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have corrected such problems 
these contingency plans may need to be refined as more information becomes available 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of us corporate debt  foreign corporate debt  us government debt  foreign government agency guaranteed debt and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum or highly liquid investments 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio thereafter total fair value fixed rate     average interest rate variable rate       average interest rate these holdings are highly liquid and we consider the potential for loss of principal to be minimal
