as a result of the factors discussed above  net earnings  excluding the restructuring charge in and the nonrecurring gains in  decreased to million in from million in some of the factors that may impact future profitability include the following the company s ability to effectively manage inventory levels in response to changes in its major suppliers price protection and return programs  the company s ability to effectively manage the utilization of service personnel  the company s ability to respond to increased competition from its suppliers direct selling initiatives  the company s ability to reduce operating expenses at a pace equal to the decline in margin percentages  demand for product  competition  manufacturer product availability  effective utilization of vendor programs  and the company s ability to implement its recently announced virtual office strategy 
compared to product revenue declined to billion in from billion in although the company shipped more desktop  laptop and server units in compared to  the units were sold at a lower average sales price primarily due to manufacturer price reductions  which contributed to the overall decrease in product revenue 
in addition  the company believes the product revenue decline was attributable to an increase in direct marketers market share and the company s effort during much of to improve product margins by reducing its low margin product business 
product gross margin as a percentage of product net revenue increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to the company s effort to reduce its low margin product business  and an increase in the amount of manufacturer sponsored incentives in compared to service revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in service revenue reflected the company s continued focus on growing the service business 
also contributing to the revenue growth in service was the increase in the number of units sold during as compared to  which increased demand for services such as configuration and installation 
service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenue increased to in from in  primarily due to an increase in billing per engineer of the company s service personnel and growth in the company s higher end service offerings  such as systems engineering and consulting  which typically have higher margins than some of the company s other services 
as a percentage of net revenue  operating expenses for increased to compared to in on an absolute dollar basis  operating expenses for increased approximately million compared to these increases were attributed to increases in service operating expenses  general and administrative expenses and depreciation expense

these increases were mainly due to the continued investment in the company s information system resources required to broaden the company s electronic commerce capabilities and improve efficiency within the company s customer center 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue for compared to these increases primarily reflected depreciation of enhancements to the company s information systems  facility improvements associated with the company s new headquarters and operations campus and furniture and fixtures required to support business activity 
financing expenses remained relatively flat in dollars when is compared to  but increased slightly as a percentage of revenue due to the decrease in revenues 
the company s borrowing levels were slightly higher in as compared to  however  these higher levels were offset by a lower effective interest rate for due to changes the company made in its financing arrangements 
the company s effective interest rate for was as compared to for during the third quarter of  the company recognized a previously deferred nonrecurring after tax gain of million 
recognition of the gain was due to the prepayment of a secured note related to the sale of the company s former subsidiary  pc parts express  inc now known as pc service source  inc

liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  this net decrease was primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in inventory  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the company s accounts payable balance fluctuates relative to the timing of product receipts and the mix of vendors 
the decrease in inventory is primarily due to the company s effort to reduce its risk associated with changes in its suppliers price protection and return programs through increasing its inventory turns 
the company increased its inventory turns from in to in the increase in accounts receivable is mainly attributable to the acquisitions completed in which resulted in higher revenues in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter the company s liquidity has been negatively impacted by the increase in the dollar volume of vendor rebate programs 
under these programs  the company is required to pay a higher initial price for product and claim a rebate to reduce the price 
the collection of these rebates can take several months 
due to the increased volume of product sold under these programs  the company s initial price for the product is often higher than the sales price the company can obtain from its customers 
as of december   these programs are a material factor in the company s financing needs 
the company s capital asset requirements are generally funded through financing arrangements and internally generated funds 
during  the company increased the size of its credit facilities in order to finance the acquisitions completed during as of december   the company s financing arrangements consist of a million securitization facility  a million working capital facility and a million real estate loan collectively  the credit agreements 
the term of the working capital facility is five years 
as of december   the securitization facility was fully utilized and the company had approximately million of availability under the working capital facility 
the million real estate loan is payable as follows the first quarterly payment of  is due on april   quarterly payments increase to  on january   and then increase to  on january   with a final payment of  due on november  the company expects to complete a sale leaseback on its headquarters building during the first half of the proceeds from the sale leaseback would be used to payoff the real estate loan and pay down a portion of the working capital facility 
the securitization facility terminates on april  the company is currently negotiating a replacement securitization facility and expects to have this agreement executed prior to april  for the month of february  the company was out of compliance with one covenant ratio of its existing securitization facility 
the company does not expect this violation to negatively impact negotiations relative to the replacement securitization facility or to negatively impact its liquidity 
on december   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under the credit agreements 
however  the company has received an amendment related to such covenants from its lenders for periods up to and including april  the company is also currently negotiating a replacement working capital facility and expects to have this agreement executed prior to april  although the new facility is expected to contain provisions that could result in lower interest rates as the company s financial performance improves  the initial interest rates are expected to be higher than the company s current effective interest rate 
if the company is not successful in implementing the replacement credit agreements  management believes there are a number of viable alternatives to ensure continued financing 
the company s business is not capital asset intensive  and capital expenditures in any year normally would not be significant in relation to the overall financial position of the company 
capital expenditures were approximately million in as compared to million in the majority of the expenditures were related to the upgrading of company hardware and software at both headquarters and branch locations 
the majority of the expenditures were related to facility improvements required to prepare the company s new headquarters and operations campus for occupancy  as well as information systems enhancements 
the company does not expect its capital expenditure requirements in to be materially different from its expenditures 
year readiness disclosure the year issue results from the fact many computer programs were previously written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
programs written in this way may recognize a date ending in as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing business delays and disruptions of operations 
the company has developed a step by step plan which details the tasks  deliverables  resources  and target dates necessary to monitor the company s information systems at the turn of the century and beyond 
assessment of the company s systems has been divided into five areas core information systems and components core is  distributed desktop systems  non is systems  new is purchases by the company  and mergers and acquisitions 
the company s core is include purchasing  order management  warehouse management  distribution  service dispatch  service parts  engineer billing  human resources and financial information systems 
distributed desktop systems include all desktop computers and related components used by the company s associates  wherever they are located 
initial assessment of these systems has included the identification of each hardware  software  tool  and package comprising these systems to determine whether or not they support year date codes 
testing  remediation  and validation of the company s core is and distributed desktop systems is planned to be completed by june remediation includes the enhancement  upgrading  migration  or replacement of non compliant hardware  software  tools and or systems 
validation entails testing of all systems including a quality control environment in which the date is artificially set forward to the year to simulate the turn of the century and beyond 
the company has also purchased a year compliance software package that will generate audit reports on a regular basis to report back any noncompliant distributed desktop systems 
the company began using this software package in january and will produce and review the reports on a regular basis through non is systems include all microcontroller systems and back up processes of core is 
microcontroller systems comprise all electronic systems such as telephones  security systems  alarms  etc 
initial assessment and remediation of the company s non is systems is currently expected to be completed during the first quarter of the company reviews each of its new potential hardware and software purchases to ensure they are year compliant 
the company completed three acquisitions during  however  these acquisitions have been integrated into the company and the major processes of the acquired systems have been replaced with the company s core is 
as part of its year assessment  the company must also consider the compliance of third parties with which the company has a material relationship  namely its vendors  suppliers  and customers 
the company relies on vendors and suppliers for hardware  software  and tools used within its own business environment 
the company has developed a year questionnaire which has been sent to its vendors and suppliers in order to ascertain whether vendors and suppliers warrant their hardware  software  and tools to be year compliant and whether vendors and suppliers have adequately addressed the year issue 
the company has documented compliance via the questionnaire for approximately of hardware  software  and tools currently in use 
for the remaining of questionnaires  if documented compliance is not received  the company s plan is to upgrade or replace for compliance  or decommission if necessary during the second quarter of the company is required to disclose a reasonable description of its most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
although noncompliance could result in a system failure  business delays  and or disruptions in operations  the company is in the process of developing a contingency plan in case a year problem occurs 
as a reseller of computer products  the company only passes through to its customers the applicable vendor s warranties  it makes no warranties regarding year compliance on any of the products it resells 
however  if one of the company s major vendors or suppliers is found to be year noncompliant which is not corrected on a timely basis  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
due to that fact  the company is still in the process of obtaining assurances from its vendors and suppliers regarding their readiness for year the company s plan also includes the availability of a test team that will test the company s information systems on an on going basis to further validate that additions or modifications to any of the company s systems do not create year compliance issues 
the company s expectations with respect to the year issues noted above are based on the premise there will be no material general failure of external systems including power  communications  transportation or financial systems necessary for the ordinary conduct of business 
at the present time  the company is developing a contingency plan to operate in the event its computer systems or those of its vendors  suppliers  or customers are not year compliant 
the company expects to have this contingency plan completed by june the company currently anticipates it will spend approximately  on year compliance  of which approximately  has been spent through december  the majority of the remaining expense is expected to be for previously identified desktop equipment and full time associates dedicated to the year compliance effort 
all previous as well as future expenditures on year compliance have or will come from operating cash flow 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its securitization facility  working capital facility and real estate loan 
the company utilizes the securitization facility and working capital facility borrowings to meet its working capital needs 
the term loan was used to finance the purchase of the company s headquarters and operations campus 
under the securitization facility  the company had borrowings of approximately million outstanding at december  which have a variable interest rate of plus an agreed upon spread 
under the working capital facility  the company had million outstanding at december  with an effective interest rate of 
under the real estate loan  the company had borrowings of approximately million with an effective interest rate of 
if the company s effective interest rate were to increase from to a increase  the effect on the company s financial statements would be immaterial 
currently  the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure
