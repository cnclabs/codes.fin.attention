contract revenue the company considers net revenue  which excludes reimbursed costs  its primary measure of revenue growth 
substantially all net revenue is earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and healthcare companies 
many of the company s contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
the company is also party to fee for service and unit of service contracts 
the company recognizes net revenue based upon labor costs expended as a percentage of total labor costs expected to be expended percentage of completion for fixed price contracts  contractual per diem or hourly rate basis as work is performed for fee for service contracts or completion of units of service for unit of service contracts 
the company s contracts generally provide for price negotiation upon scope of work changes 
the company recognizes revenue related to these scope changes when the underlying services are performed and realization of revenue is assured 
most contracts are terminable upon days notice by the customer 
in the event of termination  contracts typically require payment for services rendered through the date of termination  as well as subsequent services rendered to close out the contract 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
each contract specifies billing and payment procedures 
generally  the procedures require a portion of the contract fee to be paid at the time the project is initiated with subsequent contract billings and payments due periodically over the length of the project s term in accordance with contractual provisions 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled services  while billings in excess of revenue are classified as unearned income 
the company reports backlog based on anticipated net revenue from uncompleted projects which have been authorized by the customer through a written contract or otherwise 
using this method of reporting backlog  at december   and the backlog was approximately billion  billion and million  respectively 
the company believes that backlog may not be a consistent indicator of future results because backlog can be affected by a number of factors  including the variable size and duration of projects  many of which are performed over several years  loss or significant delay of contracts  or a change in the scope of a project during the course of a study 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenue for the year ended december  was billion  an increase of million or over fiscal net revenue of million 
growth occurred across each of the company s geographic regions and each of its major service groups 
factors contributing to the growth included an increase of contract service offerings  the provision of increased services rendered under existing contracts and the initiation of services under contracts awarded subsequent to january  direct costs  which include compensation and related fringe benefits for billable employees and other expenses directly related to contracts  were million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
general and administrative expenses  which include compensation and fringe benefits for administrative employees  non billable travel  professional services  advertising  computer and facility expenses  were million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel  facilities and locations and outside services resulting from the company s growth 
depreciation and amortization were million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
the million increase is primarily due to the increase in the capitalized asset base of the company 
in  the company recognized approximately million of depreciation expense associated with the first full year of operation for the facility in bathgate  scotland and related assets 
income from operations was million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
other expense  which consists primarily of transaction costs and interest  increased to million in from million in transaction costs included in other expense were million in versus million in the effective tax rate for was versus a rate in the effective tax rate reduction resulted from the reversal of prior year valuation allowances relating to certain net operating loss carryforwards that the company now believes are more likely than not to be utilized and profits generated in countries with favorable tax rates

related to this acquisition  the company entered into a purchase commitment valued at l million approximately million with payment due in december the company has hedged a portion of this commitment by purchasing forward contracts 
the company s forward contracts mature on december   and as of december   the company had committed to purchasing approximately l million approximately million under such contracts 
the company is obligated to purchase up to an additional l million through december  in varying amounts as the daily dollar to pound exchange rate ranges between and 
in connection with its march acquisition of pmsi  the company agreed to pay contingent value payments to former pmsi stockholders who defer receipt of one half of the shares of the company s common stock they were entitled to receive in the transaction until june  for each deferred share of the company s common stock  the contingent value payment  if any  will be calculated based on the difference between and the average closing price of the company s common stock for days selected at random out of the trading days ending on june  the company plans to make the contingent value payments  if any  from cash from operations or borrowings under existing lines of credit 
the company has available to it a l million approximately million unsecured line of credit with a uk bank and a l million approximately million unsecured line of credit with a second uk bank 
at december   the company had l million approximately million available under these credit agreements 
during  the company entered into a million senior unsecured credit facility million facility with a us bank 
at december   the company had million available under this facility 
based upon its current financing plan  the company believes the million facility would be available to retire long term credit arrangements and obligations  if necessary 
all foreign currency denominated amounts due  subsequent to december   have been translated using the thursday  december  foreign exchange rates as published in the december  edition of the wall street journal 
based on its current operating plan  the company believes that its available cash and cash equivalents  together with future cash flows from operations and borrowings under its line of credit agreements will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs in connection with its operations 
as part of its business strategy  the company reviews many acquisition candidates in the ordinary course of business  and in addition to acquisitions already made  the company is continually evaluating new acquisition and expansion possibilities 
the company may from time to time seek to obtain debt or equity financing in its ordinary course of business or to facilitate possible acquisitions or expansion 
taxes since the company conducts operations on a global basis  the company s effective tax rate has depended and will continue to depend on the amount of profits in locations with varying tax rates 
the company s results of operations will be impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various jurisdictions and by changes in any applicable tax treaties 
in particular  as the portion of the company s non us business varies  the company s effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 
the company s effective tax rate may also depend upon the extent to which the company is allowed and is able to use under applicable limitations us foreign tax credits in respect of taxes paid on its foreign operations 
inflation the company believes the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on its operations or financial condition 
impact of year issue state of readiness the company has established a year program to address the year issue  which results from computer processors and software failing to process date values correctly  potentially causing system failures or data corruption 
the year issue could cause disruptions of the company s operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process information  receive information  services or products from third parties  interface with customers in the performance of contracts  or operate or communicate in some or all of the regions in which it operates 
the company s computing infrastructure is based on industry standard systems 
the company does not depend on large legacy systems and does not use mainframes 
rather  the scope of its year program includes unique software systems and tools in each of its service groups  especially its product development service group  embedded systems in its laboratory and manufacturing operations  facilities such as elevators and fire alarms in over offices which also involve embedded technology and numerous supplier and other business relationships 
the company has identified critical systems within each service group and is devoting its resources to address these items first 
the company s year program is directed by the year executive steering team  which is comprised of the company s chief information officer and representatives from regional business units  together with legal  quality assurance and information technology personnel 
the company has established a year program management office  staffed by consultants  which develops procedures and instructions at a centralized level and oversees performance of the projects that make up the program 
project teams organized by service group and geographic region are responsible for implementation of the individual projects 
the framework for the company s year program prescribes broad inventory  assessment and planning phases which generally guide its projects 
each project generally includes launch  analysis  remediation  testing and deployment phases 
the company is in the process of assessing those systems  facilities and business relationships which it believes may be vulnerable to the year issue and which it believes could impact its operations 
although the company cannot control whether and how third parties will address the year issue  its assessment also will include a limited evaluation of certain services on which it is substantially dependent  and the company plans to develop contingency plans for possible deficiencies in those services 
for example  the company believes that among its most significant third party service providers are physician investigators who participate in clinical studies conducted through its contract research services  consequently  the company is developing a specialized process to assess and address year issues arising from these relationships 
the company does not plan to assess how its customers  such as pharmaceutical and large biotechnology companies  are dealing with the year issue 
as the company completes the assessment of its systems  it is developing plans to renovate  replace or retire them  as appropriate  if they are affected by the year issue 
such plans generally include testing of new or renovated systems upon completion of the remedial actions 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to implement these plans 
the company s strategic healthcare communications services are less dependent on information technology than its other services 
with the exception of recent acquisitions  the company s year program with respect to those services is substantially complete  with validation expected to be completed in the first quarter of the company addressed most systems relating to its healthcare consulting services in  with completion expected in the first half of the company also addressed most of its contract sales systems in  and expects to have substantially completed this program during mid the company s product development services utilize numerous systems  which it must address individually on disparate schedules  depending on the magnitude and complexity of the particular system 
the company anticipates that remediation or replacement of these systems will be substantially complete by mid  with migration occurring primarily in the second half of the company is in the process of evaluating the state of readiness of its recent acquisitions  particularly envoy and pmsi  and plans to integrate these acquisitions into its year program during the second quarter of the company expects to complete the core components of its year program before there is a significant risk that internal year problems will have a material impact on its operations 
costs the company estimates that the aggregate costs of its year program  excluding recent acquisitions  will be approximately million  including costs already incurred 
a significant portion of these costs  approximately million  are not likely to be incremental costs  but rather will represent the redeployment of existing resources 
this reallocation of resources is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s day to day operations 
the company incurred total year program costs of million through december   of which approximately million represented incremental expense 
envoy previously estimated its year costs to be between and million and pmsi previously estimated that its year costs would not be material 
the company is in the process of assessing these valuations as part of the integration of these acquisitions into its year program 
the company s estimates regarding the cost  timing and impact of addressing the year issue are based on numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  its ability to meet deadlines and the cooperation of third parties 
the company cannot provide assurance that its assumptions will be correct and that these estimates will be achieved 
actual results could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of numerous factors  including the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  unforeseen circumstances that would cause the company to allocate its resources elsewhere and similar uncertainties 
year risks the company faces both internal and external risks from the year issue 
if realized  these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s primary internal risk is that its systems will not be year compliant on time 
the magnitude of this risk depends on the company s ability to achieve compliance of both internally and externally developed systems or to migrate to alternate systems in a timely fashion 
the decentralized nature of the company s business may compound this risk if it is unable to coordinate efforts across its global operations on a timely basis 
the company believes that its year program will successfully address these risks  however  the company cannot provide assurance that this program will be completed in a timely manner 
notwithstanding its year program  the company also faces external risks that may be beyond its control 
the company s international operations and its relationships with foreign third parties create additional risks for the company  as many countries outside the united states have been less attuned to the year issue 
these risks include the possibility that infrastructural systems  such as electricity  water  natural gas or telephony  will fail in some or all of the regions in which the company operates  as well as the danger that the internal systems of its foreign suppliers  service providers and customers will fail 
the company s business also requires considerable travel  and its ability to perform services under its customer contracts could be negatively affected if air travel is disrupted by the year issue 
in addition  the company s business depends heavily on the healthcare industry  particularly on third party physician investigators 
the healthcare industry  and physicians groups in particular  to date may not have focused on the year issue to the same degree as some other industries  especially outside of major metropolitan centers 
as a result  the company faces increased risk that its physician investigators will be unable to provide it with the data that the company needs to perform under its contracts on time  if at all 
thus  the clinical study involved could be slowed or brought to a halt 
also  the failure of its customers to address the year issue could negatively impact their ability to utilize the company s services 
while it intends to develop contingency plans to address certain of these risks  the company cannot assure you that any developed plans will sufficiently insulate it from the effects of these risks 
any disruptions resulting from the realization of these risks would affect the company s ability to perform its services 
if the company is unable to receive or process information  or if third parties are unable to provide information or services to it  the company may not be able to meet milestones or obligations under its customer contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results 
contingencies until it has completed its remediation  testing and deployment plans  the company believes it is premature to develop contingency plans to address what would happen if its execution of these plans were to fail to address the year issue 
conversion to the euro currency on january   a new currency  the euro  became the legal currency for of the member countries of the european economic community 
between january  and january   governments  companies and individuals may conduct business in the member countries in both the euro and existing national currencies 
on january   the euro will become the sole currency in the member countries 
the company conducts business in the member countries 
the company is reviewing the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
the more important issues the company is reviewing include whether the company may have to change the prices of its services in the different countries and whether the company will have to change the terms of any financial instruments in connection with its hedging activities 
based on current information and its initial evaluation  the company believes that the use of the euro will not have a significant impact on the company s business or operations 
accordingly  the company does not expect the conversion to the euro to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
recent events on january   the company acquired substantial assets of hoechst marion roussel s hmr kansas city based drug innovation and approval facility for approximately million in cash  most of which is expected to be paid in the second half of when the acquisition of the physical facility is completed 
as part of this transaction  the company was awarded a million contract for continued support and completion of ongoing hmr development projects over a five year period 
in addition  hmr will offer the company the opportunity to provide all us outsourcing services up to an additional million over the same period

recently issued accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 

statement no 
requires that upon adoption  all derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value  and that changes in such fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met 
changes in the values of derivatives that meet these hedging criteria will ultimately offset related earnings effects of the hedged items  effects of certain changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income pending recognition in earnings 
the company will adopt statement no 
when required to do so on january  because of its limited use of derivatives  the company does not expect the application of statement no 
to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity price changes and the company regularly evaluates its exposure to such changes 
the company s overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
from time to time  the company has utilized forward exchange contracts to manage its foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the company s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
foreign currency exchange rates approximately  and of the company s net revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively  were derived from the company s operations outside the united states 
the company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component reduction of shareholders equity were million at december  as compared to million at december  the company may be subject to foreign currency transaction risk when the company s service contracts are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the company earns fees or incurs expenses related to such contracts 
at december   the company s most significant foreign currency exchange rate exposures were in the british pound  german mark and french franc 
the company limits its foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in its contracts with customers  or the company may hedge its transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options 
the company recognizes changes in value in income only when foreign currency exchange contracts or options are settled or exercised  respectively 
there were several foreign exchange contracts relating to service contracts open at december   all of which are immaterial to the company 
as of december   the company has a long term obligation denominated in a foreign currency approximately l million and a short term obligation denominated in a foreign currency approximately l million 
assuming a hypothetical change of in year end exchange rates a weakening of the us dollar  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million 
interest rates at december   the company has million of convertible subordinated notes notes due may  the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the carrying value of the notes at december  approximates the fair value 
a increase in prevailing interest rates at december  would not result in a material decrease in the fair value of the notes due to the short maturity 
currently  the company does not hold any derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio consists primarily of us government securities and money funds 
the portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale and therefore these investments are recorded at fair value in the financial statements 
these securities are exposed to market price risk which also takes into account interest rate risk 
as of december   the fair value of the investment portfolio was million  based on quoted market prices 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of in quoted market price is approximately million
