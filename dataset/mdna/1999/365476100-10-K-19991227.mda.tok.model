the company believes that the impact of inflation on the net loss was not material for fiscal years and liquidity and capital resources at september   the company had working capital of million  which included million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million in working capital at december   including million of cash and cash equivalents

inventory turned times on an annualized basis during the quarter ended september   compared to times on an annualized basis during the fourth quarter of deferred taxes increased to million at september  from million at december  primarily as a result of tax benefits relating to net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has tax net operating loss carryforwards nols totaling approximately million  which expire as follows million and million 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas requires that the tax benefit of such nols be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such nols to be more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
management has determined  based primarily on a strategic shift in the third quarter of fiscal to a more profit driven business model  as outlined below  that taxable income of the company will more likely than not be sufficient to utilize fully the million of nols in the next three to five years 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recorded 
the nols available for future utilization were generated principally as a result of the company s strategic initiative  begun in  to penetrate the retail grocery channel  which is the largest channel of distribution 
the company began a more aggressive advertising and marketing program  including a national television advertising program in and  in order to expand distribution and grow the veggie burger category 
the company invested over million in discretionary marketing spending during fiscal and an additional million in discretionary marketing spending during fiscal prior to this strategic initiative  the company had historically been profitable  but had spent very little on discretionary advertising and marketing 
the increased advertising and marketing spending resulted in more than doubling the sales levels that existed back in the company plans to adjust its rapid growth strategy during fiscal to a lower expense  more profit driven business model 
this will be accomplished primarily by a substantial reduction in the discretionary advertising and marketing spending that has occurred during the last three years 
management does not believe that such reductions will have a significant impact on recent historical sales levels 
additionally  the company has already begun streamlining its operations at its clearfield plant  through reductions in workforce of approximately along with workforce reductions at its corporate headquarters of 
at the same time  the company anticipates achieving greater operating efficiencies at its clearfield plant as a result of the consolidation of manufacturing locations and the automation of the company s manufacturing processes 
operating efficiencies gained by the changes in operations are expected to result in improved performance  measured primarily by gross margin dollars 
realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the company s ability to generate taxable income within the carryforward period 
management anticipates that increases in taxable income  as a result of the changes in operating strategy outlined above  will be sufficient to utilize fully the nols prior to their ultimate expiration date 
future levels of operating income are dependent upon general economic conditions  including continued growth of the meatless burger category  competitive pressures on sales and gross margins and other factors beyond the company s control  and no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of the nols 
management has considered the above factors in reaching its conclusion that it is likely that taxable income will be sufficient to utilize fully the nols in the near term and prior to their ultimate expiration date 
however  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for net operating losses in future periods if its revised business goals are not achieved 
accounts payable decreased to million at september  from million at december  primarily as a result of lower expenditures for inventories as a result of the company s efforts to reduce inventory levels 
payroll and related liabilities decreased to million at september  from million at december  primarily as a result of bonus accruals at december  that did not exist at september  capital expenditures of million during primarily resulted from expenditures for the company s new management information system and for production equipment in clearfield not covered under the company s operating leases

upon adjustment of the conversion price of the company s series b convertible preferred stock as discussed below  the conversion price of the notes will likely decrease to per share 
under the terms of the note purchase agreement relating to the notes  the company must comply with certain covenants and maintain certain financial ratios as follows current assets to current liabilities of at least to  measured monthly  total liabilities  exclusive of the notes and convertible redeemable preferred stock  to tangible net worth  inclusive of the notes and convertible redeemable preferred stock  not to exceed to  measured monthly  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the note purchase agreement  of to  measured annually

the company is required to meet certain performance targets for the twelve months ending december  under the series b preferred stock agreement 
these targets are million in net sales  and an operating loss of not more than million 
it is anticipated that the series b conversion price will be adjusted to per share due to the likelihood that the company will not meet the specified performance targets for calendar if the conversion price is adjusted  the company will be required to record approximately million of additional preferred dividends to account for this beneficial conversion feature

see note subsequent events of the notes to financial statements 
the company leases various food processing  production and other equipment in use at its clearfield  utah production facility pursuant to two lease agreements between the company and ba leasing capital corporation ba capital  an affiliate of bank of america 
each lease agreement contains a cross default provision stating that any default under any other borrowing or credit agreement that includes a failure to make payment when due or gives the holder a right of acceleration constitutes an event of default under each lease agreement 
if any event of default by the company occurred under the lease agreements with ba capital  the company s manufacturing capacity would be significantly curtailed or even eliminated if ba capital were to exercise its right to sell the equipment 
in addition  neither lease agreement contains express provisions giving the company a right to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term  which terms range from five to seven years  depending upon the equipment 
management believes that the company s existing working capital  in combination with cash flow from operations and funds available under credit facilities  will be sufficient to support working capital requirements in the near term 
year information systems the company utilizes packaged application strategies for all critical information systems functions  which have all been certified to be year compliant by the vendors 
this includes enterprise software  operating systems  networking components  application and data servers  pc hardware  and core office automation software 
the company performed various component tests to verify full year operational readiness and modification was completed on all non compliant equipment 
in addition to the information system component testing  the company has conducted a system wide test  including all components from the desktop to the data center  to ensure that all of the compliant components will function properly as a whole 
the focus of these tests was to assure that the company s business processes will run end to end with no year errors or issues 
supplier and customer base the company has completed a year supplier and customer audit program 
as a part of this program  the company contacted all of its critical suppliers and significant customers to inform them of the company s year expectations and requested copies of their compliance programs 
although the company discovered a number of non compliant products and vendors  none of these vendors or products were key to the company s operations 
cost the company incurred approximately  of incremental costs to assess year readiness of its information systems 
all system hardware and software upgrades were budgeted in the normal course of business regardless of the year issue 
risks despite the company s efforts to identify all internal systems with year issues  it is likely that unexpected problems will arise 
as with most businesses  the company will also be at risk from external infrastructure failures that could arise from year failures 
it is possible  for example  that electrical power  telephone and financial networks across the nation will experience breakdowns in the days and weeks following january  there is also a real possibility of failures of key components in the national transportation infrastructure or delays in rail  over the road and air shipments due to failures in transportation control systems due to the year problem 
investigation and assessment of risks associated with such ubiquitous and interconnected utility systems and transportation systems are beyond the resources of the company 
the failure by the company or third parties to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain of the company s normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
contingency plans the company intends to have two weeks of inventory on hand to support a possible interruption in production 
the company is also scheduling work and projects so that an interruption of either the information system or production would not cause a work stoppage 
an emergency call list will be in place when the system comes up on january  in case of an emergency 
new accounting pronouncement in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is an amendment to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for all derivative instruments 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not currently have any derivative instruments and  accordingly  does not expect the adoption of sfas to have an impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s only financial instrument with market risk exposure is its variable rate line of credit 
at september   the company had million outstanding under this credit line at an annual interest rate of percent 
a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s cash flows
