year yk readiness disclosure the company is aware of the issues related to the approach of the year and has assessed and investigated what steps must be taken to ensure that its critical systems and equipment will function appropriately after the turn of the century 
the company has completed a review of each of its core systems to determine their yk compliance 
as a result  the company is replacing its service management system with one designed to be yk compliant from inception 
the remaining core systems are vendor supplied and maintained systems where the company has received yk compliant upgrades and is in various stages of implementation and testing

management believes that the company s current state of readiness  the nature of the company s business  and the availability of the contingency plan minimizes yk risks 
management does not foresee significant liability to third parties if the company s systems are not yk compliant 
as significant yk uncertainties remain outside the control of the company  at this time the company is unable to determine a most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
through september   the company has incurred  in addition to the service management system costs noted above  
million of internal staff costs necessary to review and further yk compliance of its core operating systems 
all yk costs have been and will continue to be funded from operations

million
