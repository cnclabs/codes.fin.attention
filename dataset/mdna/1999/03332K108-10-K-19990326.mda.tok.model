net sales to the company s japanese distributors decreased from approximately  of total sales in to  of total sales in general economic conditions in japan continue to make future sales to the company s japanese distributors uncertain 
the decline in net sales to the company s japanese distributors was partially offset by net sales of approximately  to boeing and license fee revenue of approximately  from inrange technologies corporation see liquidity and capital resources generated during the fourth quarter 
the company s shift in marketing focus to opportunities in the storage area network market has resulted in diminished revenues from customers in the high performance local area network market 
although the company intends to continue to offer its fibre channel products to select customers in the high performance network market  the company plans to focus its resources on the storage area network market 
the slower than anticipated market development in the storage area network market combined with the lack of orders from the company s japanese distributors and diminished revenues from the local area network market  will likely result in continued weak revenues until the storage area network market develops 
net sales for increased by approximately  from to  the increase in net sales was due primarily to a significant increase in net sales to the company s japanese distributors  offset by a decrease in sales domestically 
international net sales increased  from approximately  in to  in  representing of total net sales for the year 
net sales to the company s japanese distributors increased from  of international sales in to  of international sales in  and represented of total net sales for the year 
domestic sales volume decreased by approximately  from to  as several large sales transactions included in revenue for were not replaced in the increase in net sales for included the effect of an allowance against sales of  for product returns and customer stock rotation 
there was no addition to the allowance recorded in the company does not generally provide customers with a right of return at the date of sale  however  in response to significant pressure from the marketplace  the company has allowed product returns in the past from certain customers as a marketing concession to stimulate a positive impression of the company and its products in the marketplace 
in addition  resellers have incorrectly anticipated the configuration needed by end user equipment purchasers and have requested that purchased but unused product be exchanged for the product needed to meet the end user requirements 
further  certain end users have requested that they purchase their initial products from the company  instead of the reseller  which resulted in credits issued to the resellers in the first quarter of additionally  in the fourth quarter  the company recorded additional reserves for sales returns and allowances which may occur as a result of the company s shift in marketing focus to oems and resellers who are more experienced in and are focused on specific vertical markets that the company believes are most appropriate for its products 
as a result of all of these factors  the company s net assets included a reserve to provide for potential future return of product sold in and previous periods 
the reserve balance at december   was approximately   gross sales less the estimated value of the product to be returned 
the reserve was fully utilized during with a resulting balance of zero at december  gross profit gross profit in decreased to a loss of approximately  or a negative of sales  from a profit of approximately  or of sales in the decrease in gross profit for from the prior year was primarily attributable to special charges of approximately  recorded in the cost of sales for the second quarter 
these charges included i  provision for excess or obsolete inventory  ii  provision for future commitments to purchase excess or obsolete inventory  and iii  fee for canceling an order for excess or obsolete inventory 
the company made these provisions because its shift in focus from local area networks to storage area networks and lack of demand in japan have caused it to believe its inventory of certain product exceeds current and future market demands 
gross profit for excluding the effects of the special charges was  
a similar lesser provision was recorded in the decrease in gross margin is also due in part to the decreased sales volume and is affected by indirect costs  such as normal scrap and overhead allocations  the impact of which is decreased as sales increase 
gross profit percentage is impacted by the mix of product sold within a period 
in general  adapter cards have lower margins than switch and service revenue and different switch types have different margins 
for  the gross margin percentage was positively impacted because the mix of product sold during the period carried greater margins than that sold in the comparable periods in however  due to the significantly lower sales volume  the indirect costs caused the overall gross profit percentage to decrease over gross profit in decreased to approximately  or of sales  from approximately  or in although a higher mix of switches versus adapters was sold in than  the higher gross margins on the switches were offset by provisions made for excess and obsolete inventory 
included in the cost of sales for is  provision for excess and obsolete inventory which had the effect of decreasing gross profit as a percentage of sales by 
the company made this provision because changes in the fibre channel market caused it to believe i its inventory of certain host bus adapter cards exceeded market demands as customers transitioned to newer server and workstation platforms  and ii its inventory of certain component parts used for earlier version switches was made obsolete by newer generation of switches 
for these same excess and obsolescence reasons  when calculating the allowance for potential returns  the company reduced the estimated value of the product to be returned 
operating expenses the company s operating expenses for were approximately  or of net sales  compared to approximately  or of net sales  in the company believes that the level of expense incurred is appropriate to address the opportunities available to it in the oem storage and high performance networking marketplaces 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative sga expenses is primarily due to a change in the process of allocation of depreciation and a decrease in indirect marketing efforts  offset by increases in the cost for personnel 
although the company did not change its methods of depreciation  it did change its process for allocating total depreciation to reflect the usage of the related assets  such that approximately  of depreciation expense was reclassified in from sga to research and development when compared to additionally  the shift in the company s marketing focus required changes in marketing tactics  employing direct contact with potential oem customers through increased sales staff and less indirect contact through seminar presentations and advertising

in addition to the  depreciation allocation described above  the company s ongoing commitment to product development and enhancements  including the cost of additional engineering personnel  caused an increase in development expenses of approximately  in as compared with the company s operating expenses for were approximately  of net sales  compared to approximately  of net sales in the increase in operating expense is due to an increase in the cost for personnel  increased marketing and sales expenses to prepare for the oem storage market  and increased depreciation 
personnel and related expenses increased approximately  in as compared with this increase was caused in part by a increase in the number of employees at december  than at december  also included in this increase is a third quarter charge of  recorded to reflect compensation owed to a former executive of the company whose services were discontinued 
the amount of the accrual was based on the compensation payable to such executive under the terms of the executive s employment contract 
additionally  the company s ongoing aggressive commitment to front end spending for marketing and sales tactics resulted in advertising and marketing expense increasing approximately  over further  primarily due to amortization of capitalized software development costs  depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately  as compared with other income expense interest expense increased to approximately  in from approximately  in as a result of the company s payments on an increased level of capitalized lease obligations 
however  the interest expense of approximately  decreased from approximately  in as a result of the company s repayment of a million note payable in june interest income of approximately   and  in  and  respectively  was earned from the investment of the net proceeds of preferred stock offerings occurring in the first quarter of each year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of liquidity at december  was cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately  this compares to approximately  at year end  and to approximately  at year end net cash used in operating activities of approximately  in decreased from approximately  in and from approximately  in the primary reason for the decrease in was the receipt of approximately  by the company as part of the technology license agreement the company signed with inrange technologies  inc  which will be performed over the next five years see below 
this was offset by the operating loss and excess and obsolete inventory purchase commitments incurred
