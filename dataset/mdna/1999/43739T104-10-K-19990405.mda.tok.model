information discussed herein includes statements that are forward looking in nature  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act 
as with any forward looking statements  these statements are subject to a number of factors and assumptions  including competitive activities  economic conditions in the market area and results of its future capital expenditures 
in reviewing such information  it should be kept in mind that actual results may differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements 
year the year issue results from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as the year approaches  systems using such programs may be unable to accurately process certain date based information 
like many other companies  the company is continuing to assess and modify its computer applications and business processes to provide for their continued functionality 
commencing in october  the company implemented a program of evaluating its computer systems to identify areas of potential concern  both with respect to information technology and non information technology systems eg  microcontrollers  remediating replacing systems to address those potential areas of concern  and ultimately  testing those changes for compliance 
this continuing assessment has been implemented on a system by system basis and includes the readiness of external entities  such as vendors  which interface with the company 
such program has included and will continue to include both consultation by homeland with the vendors who provided its computer systems and internal testing by homeland of those computer systems 
the company has completed its evaluation of systems and its detailed planning for remediating or replacing non compliant systems 
remediation replacement efforts are approximately complete and testing procedures are approximately complete 
testing procedure have included tests of certain systems for which remediation replacement efforts were ultimately deemed unnecessary based on the positive results of such tests 
the company has assessed its vendors year readiness  principally through the review of questionnaires which the company has circulated to its vendors 
awg  which supplies approximately of the goods sold in the company s stores  believes that it will be year compliant 
although not all of the responses from other vendors have been conclusive  management does not presently expect that it will be adversely affected by its vendors year readiness 
a significant portion of the company s systems were found to be year compliant without any remediation or replacement efforts 
the area of most concern for management has been the point of sale pos computers used in the operation of the stores 
internal tests conducted by homeland generally reflect that its pos software is already year compliant  however  the company was unable to obtain reasonable assurance and support from the software provider to corroborate the conclusions of its pos testing of the current software 
as a result  the company has elected to upgrade its pos software to the year version which the vendor states its compliant 
the incremental cost is approximately million and will be installed during the second quarter of additionally  the company will further test the software upon full installation 
the company is also replacing older power management systems which operate various systems in the stores 
the new systems are currently being installed and it is anticipated that the conversion will be completed by the end of the third quarter of the estimated capital investment is million 
the cost of the program is not expected to exceed million  the majority of which is described above for power management systems and upgrades to pos software 
approximately million has been incurred as of january  homeland is funding these costs under its working capital facility 
based on its assessment  its progress to date  and its expectation of continued testing of systems  the company believes that its efforts will result in year compliance by the end of the third quarter of if circumstances arise indicating the company s and or vendor s efforts will not be succesful in achieving year compliance  the company believes it can develop and implement effective contingency plans in a timely manner 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year process  primarily due to issues surrounding the year readiness of third party suppliers and vendors  a reasonable worst case scenario is difficult to determine at this time 
the company does not anticipate more than temporary isolated disruptions attributed to year issues to affect either the company or its primary vendors 
the measurement of year compliance is necessarily fluid and management will continue to monitor the extent of such compliance and its effects associated with any non compliance 
inflation deflation although the company does not expect inflation or deflation to have a material impact in the future  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in future periods
