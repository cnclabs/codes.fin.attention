results of operations for the years ended december   and nvr  inc nvr or the company operates in two business segments homebuilding and mortgage banking 
the results of these two segments are discussed separately below 
corporate general and administrative expenses are fully allocated to the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments in the information presented below 
effective september   nvr merged each of nvr homes  inc  nvr s wholly owned homebuilding subsidiary  and nvr financial services  inc  nvr s wholly owned mortgage banking holding company  into the company 
the company now conducts its homebuilding activities both directly and through its wholly owned subsidiary  fox ridge homes  inc fox ridge 
the company conducts its mortgage banking operations primarily through another wholly owned subsidiary  nvr mortgage finance  inc nvr finance 
homebuilding segment homebuilding revenues for increased to  from  in the increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of homes settled from  units in to  units in and to a increase in the average settlement price from in to in new orders for increased to  units compared with  units in the increase in new orders was the result of continuing favorable market conditions in most of the markets in which the company operates as compared to the prior year  and to a lesser extent  new orders generated by fox ridge  acquired by the company during the fourth quarter of homebuilding revenues for increased to  from  in the increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of homes settled from  units in to  units in and to a increase in the average settlement price from in to in new orders for increased to  units compared with  units in the increase in new orders is attributed to a more favorable interest rate environment in compared to the prior year  and to sales associated with the company s expansion markets 
gross profit margins increased to in compared to in the increase in gross profit margins from that experienced in was primarily attributable to the continuing favorable market conditions  improved margins in the company s expansion markets and the company s continued emphasis on controlling construction costs 
gross profit margins increased to in compared to in the increase in gross profit margins from that experienced in was primarily attributable to more favorable market conditions in certain of the company s markets  fewer additional weather related costs incurred in the construction of homes as a result of mild winter weather conditions in nvr s principal markets in the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of  and continued emphasis on controlling construction costs 
sg a expenses for increased  to  from  in  but as a percentage of revenues fell to in from in the increase in sg a dollars is due primarily to the aforementioned increase in revenues  a net year to year increase for certain management incentive plans and to increased costs incurred in the company s expansion markets 
sg a expenses for increased  to  from  in  and as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the dollar increase is partially due to increased costs that correspond to the aforementioned increase in revenues  and costs incurred to grow the company s expansion markets to full operational levels 
further  the higher sg a in as compared to is also attributable to an increase of approximately  for non cash compensation costs related to the management equity incentive plan plan  a variable stock plan adopted by the board of directors pursuant to the company s plan of reorganization reorganization plan  and to a non recurring  incentive payment earned by and paid to the company s board of directors also pursuant to the terms of the company s reorganization plan 
the final one third of the  total shares granted under the plan are eligible to vest in calendar year if certain full year earnings targets for are met or exceeded 
pursuant to the plan  the approximately  shares eligible for vesting in may vest at a date earlier than december  if the full year earnings targets specified in the plan are met or exceeded prior to december  plan participants must be employed by the company on december  to be eligible to receive the shares 
the compensation cost recognized in sg a in the company s income statement relative to the plan will depend on the market value of nvr common stock on the vesting determination date 
compensation cost recognized in sg a relative to the plan totaled  and  for the years end december  and  respectively 
compensation cost relative to the plan is non cash 
backlog units and dollars were  and  respectively  at december  compared to backlog units of  and dollars of  at december  the increase in backlog dollars and units was primarily due to a increase in new orders for the six months ended december  as compared to the six months ended december  backlog units and dollars were  and  respectively  at december  compared to backlog units of  and dollars of  at december  the increase in backlog dollars and units was primarily due to a increase in new orders for the six months ended december  as compared to the six months ended december  the company believes that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda provides a meaningful comparison of operating performance of the homebuilding segment because it excludes the amortization of certain intangible assets and other non cash items 
although the company believes the calculation is helpful in understanding the performance of the homebuilding segment  ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow as indicators of the company s financial performance or its ability to generate liquidity 
calculation of homebuilding ebitda year ended december  operating income    depreciation    amortization of excess reorganization value goodwill    other non cash items    homebuilding ebitda    of homebuilding revenues homebuilding ebitda in was higher than in  and as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in homebuilding ebitda in was higher than in  and as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in mortgage banking segment the mortgage banking segment generated operating income of  for the year ended december  compared to operating income of  during the year ended december  and operating income of  during the year ended december  mortgage loan closings were   and  during the respective years ended december   and operating income was higher in in comparison to as a result of the increase in mortgage loan closings noted previously 
mortgage banking fees  a summary of which is presented below  increased  when comparing and and increased  when comparing and mortgage banking fees net gain on sale of loans    servicing    title services    gain loss on sale of servicing    mortgage banking fees in were higher in comparison to  primarily as a result of higher gain on sale of loans and higher title services revenues 
the higher gain on sale of loans and title services revenues can also be attributed to increased mortgage loan closings 
partially offsetting the increase in mortgage banking fees were volume related increases in sg a expenses 
mortgage banking fees in were higher in comparison to  primarily as a result of higher gain on sale of loans 
the higher gain on sale of loans can be attributed to increased loan closings and higher servicing values realized through the sale of mortgage servicing rights 
these gains were partially offset by the lower servicing fee revenues resulting from the reduction in the mortgage servicing portfolio 
operating income was also higher in in comparison to as a result of the increase in mortgage loan closings noted above and other income from a joint venture  which effectively began operations during effective during the second quarter of  the mortgage banking operations sold the remaining portion of its core mortgage servicing portfolio 
the sale of the core mortgage servicing portfolio and the ongoing sale of servicing rights on a flow basis are the result of the concentration of the mortgage banking operations on the primary business of providing mortgage financing and related services to nvr s homebuilding customers and other homebuyers 
seasonality the results of nvr s homebuilding operations generally reflect the seasonality of the housing market in the middle atlantic region of the united states 
nvr historically has entered into more sales contracts in this region during the first and second quarters 
because nvr s mortgage banking operations generate part of their business from nvr s homebuilding operations and from other homebuilders affected by seasonality  to the extent that homebuilding is affected by seasonality  mortgage banking operations may also be affected 
the existence of mortgage banking and title services offices outside of the middle atlantic region and the existence of third party business tend to reduce the effects of seasonality on the results of nvr s operations 
effective tax rate the merger of nvr homes  inc and nvr financial services  inc into the company on september  allowed the company to utilize a separate return limitation year net operating loss srly nol generated by the company s previously owned savings and loan institution  nvr savings bank 
as a result  the company realized a  tax benefit during the use of the srly nol  coupled with higher taxable income relative to fixed permanent differences  has reduced the company s effective tax rate to from in and in recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires all derivatives to be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and be measured at fair value 
depending on the hedge designation  changes in such fair value will be recognized in either other comprehensive income or current earnings on the income statement 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and is applicable to interim periods in the initial year of adoption 
at the present time  the company cannot determine the impact that sfas no 
will have on its financial statements upon adoption on january   as such impact will be determined based on loans held in inventory and forward mortgage delivery contracts outstanding at the date of adoption 
year issue the year issue is the risk that computer programs using two digit date fields will fail to properly recognize the year  with the result being business interruptions due to computer system failures by the company s software or hardware or that of government entities  service providers and vendors 
with the assistance of a consulting firm  the company has completed its assessment of exposure to year issues and has developed a detailed plan to remediate areas of exposure in both its homebuilding and mortgage banking segments  as discussed below 
the company has substantially completed its remediation and testing efforts on its core homebuilding systems and believes that these systems are now year compliant 
the total year issue costs for the homebuilding systems were approximately  all of which has been expensed during the mortgage banking segment utilizes the following four core systems to operate its business loan origination  secondary marketing  servicing  and settlement services 
during a decision was made to replace the existing loan origination system to obtain greater operating efficiencies 
the existing system is not year compliant 
the company has purchased a new commercially available software package for loan origination processing  which has been certified to be year compliant by the vendor 
the company has tested the system and believes that it is year compliant 
the company has developed a detailed rollout plan and will start implementation in february into its mortgage branches 
the new system is expected to be deployed in each branch by the third quarter of the total cost of this project is estimated to be  the majority of which will be incurred and capitalized during the company has upgraded the existing secondary marketing system to the year compliant version of the vendor s software  and based on testing conducted during  the company believes this system to be year compliant 
the servicing and settlement services systems are also purchased software packages  which the vendors have indicated are both year compliant 
the company has completed testing on the settlement services system and believes that this system is year compliant 
the servicing system testing should be completed by march  the total cost of updating and testing these systems is estimated to be  the majority of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of the company initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and service providers during to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to their failure to correct their own year issues and intends to continue those communications during to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  the company will attempt to identity alternative suppliers and service providers who have demonstrated year readiness 
as a normal course of business  the company seeks to maintain multiple suppliers where possible 
the company cannot be assured that it will be successful in finding such alternative suppliers  service providers and contractors or  if it is successful in finding such alternative suppliers  service providers and contractors  that it will be able to do so at comparable prices 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers or service providers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  and the company is unable to replace them at comparable prices  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
the company is currently assessing its mechanical systems eg  phones  hvac  etc 
which employ embedded chip technology 
based on initial information gathered  the company does not estimate a significant expense will be incurred to make any non compliant systems year compliant 
the company presently believes that upon remediation of its business software and hardware applications  the year issue will not present a material adverse risk to the company s future consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources 
however  if such remediation is not completed in a timely manner or the level of timely compliance by key suppliers or service providers is not sufficient  the year issue could have a material impact on the company s operations including  but not limited to  delays in homebuilding and mortgage products resulting in loss of revenues  increased operating costs  loss of customers or suppliers  or other significant disruptions to the company s business 
in addition  widespread disruptions in the national or international economy  including  for example  disruptions affecting financial markets  commercial and investment banks  governmental agencies  utility services  such as heat  lights  power and telephones  and transportation systems could also have an adverse impact on the company 
the likelihood and effects of such disruptions are not determinable at this time 
the company will evaluate the necessity for contingency planning during as it implements and tests its loan origination system and if communications with significant suppliers and service providers indicate that the company may be vulnerable to their failure to correct their own year issues 
this evaluation will continue throughout liquidity and capital resources nvr s homebuilding segment generally provides for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations and a short term credit facility 
in september  the company  as borrower  succeeded to the obligations of nvr homes  inc under the unsecured working capital revolving credit facility as amended and restated the facility 
the facility expires on may  the facility provides for borrowings of up to  of which  is currently committed 
under terms of the facility  an additional  uncommitted overline is available to the company on a limited basis 
up to approximately  of the facility is currently available for issuance in the form of letters of credit of which  was outstanding at december  there were no direct borrowings outstanding under the facility as of december  nvr s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as various short term credit facilities 
nvr finance has available a  mortgage warehouse facility  of which  is committed  to fund its mortgage origination activities  under which  was outstanding at december  nvr finance from time to time enters into various gestation and repurchase agreements 
nvr finance currently has available an aggregate of  of borrowing capacity in such uncommitted facilities 
there was an aggregate of  outstanding under such gestation and repurchase agreements at december  on january   the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to  of the company s debt securities 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective on february  and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series  and in the form of senior or subordinated debt 
on april   the company completed an offering under the shelf registration statement for  of senior notes due the new notes  resulting in aggregate net proceeds to the company of approximately  after fees and expenses 
the new notes mature on june  and bear interest at  payable semi annually on june and december of each year  commencing june  the new notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company  ranking equally in right of payment with the company s other existing and future unsecured indebtedness 
an additional  in principal is available for issuance under the new note offering 
the net proceeds of the new notes were used to extinguish other indebtedness of the company  as described below 
through a tender offer commenced on april  and completed on may   various open market purchases throughout and a contractual call exercised on december   the company repurchased all of the  in aggregate principal outstanding under the company s senior notes due senior notes 
the senior notes were retired upon purchase 
the amount of funds expended to complete the senior note repurchase totaled  excluding accrued interest  and resulted in the recognition of an extraordinary loss of  net of a  tax benefit  per diluted share in the accompanying consolidated income statements 
in addition  the company exercised its option to purchase two office buildings currently utilized by nvr for certain administrative functions of both its homebuilding and mortgage banking segments  thereby extinguishing the company s obligations under the capital lease pertaining to these buildings 
the company expended funds of  excluding accrued interest  to extinguish the capital lease obligation and recognized an additional extraordinary loss of  net of a  tax benefit  per diluted share in the accompanying consolidated income statements 
subsequent to december   the company sold both buildings to an unrelated third party and leased back one of the buildings under an operating lease for a five year term expiring in there was no resultant material gain or loss on the sale transaction 
nvr finance s mortgage warehouse facility limits the ability of nvr finance to transfer funds to nvr in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
nvr finance had net assets of  as of december   that were so restricted 
as shown in nvr s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   nvr s operating activities used cash of  for this period 
the cash was used primarily to increase homebuilding inventory due to a general increase in the company s business activity 
further  cash was also used to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale which was related to an increase in mortgage loan closings during compared to fiscal year s loan closing volume 
net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december  the primary sources of cash were principal payments on and proceeds from the sale of mortgage backed securities  which are primarily used for the redemption of bonds as discussed below  and proceeds from the sale of mortgage servicing rights 
net cash used for financing activities was  for the year ended december  in addition to the debt refinancing activities discussed above  cash was primarily used for nvr s purchase of approximately million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  during the year ended december  the company may  from time to time  repurchase additional shares of its common stock  pursuant to repurchase authorizations by the board of directors and subject to the restrictions contained within the company s debt agreements 
nvr had net borrowings under the mortgage banking credit lines of  used to finance mortgage loan inventory 
cash was also used for the redemption of collateralized bonds using cash provided by the related mortgage backed securities as discussed above 
the company believes that internally generated cash and borrowings available under credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both its homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 
business acquisition on march   nvr mortgage acquisition  inc nvrma  a wholly owned subsidiary of nvr finance  purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of first republic mortgage corporation first republic for approximately  in cash

based on the expected loan origination volume of first republic  nvr finance has amended its warehouse line to increase the available borrowing limit under the warehouse agreement to  in addition  first republic has entered into a separate revolving short term borrowing facility with a lender not party to the nvr finance warehouse agreement comprised of a  committed line of credit that bears interest at to above libor 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
though the company faces and manages other types of risk  such as credit and liquidity risks  the company s market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments 
interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
in addition  lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers  as well as for the demand for refinancing of existing mortgages 
higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans and reduce demand for refinance loans 
the company has no market rate sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
the company s mortgage banking segment  which has contributed an average of of consolidated income from continuing operations over the period to  is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities 
the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans  which are generally sold through optional and mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets 
substantially all of the mortgage banking segment s loan portfolio is held for sale 
profitability of the mortgage banking segment may be directly affected by the levels of and fluctuations in interest rates  which affect the mortgage banking segment s ability to earn a spread between interest received on its mortgage loans held for sale and the costs of borrowings under the company s variable rate warehouse line of credit and uncommitted repurchase and gestation facilities 
the profitability of the mortgage banking segment is likely to be adversely affected during any period of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates 
for example  a substantial or sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the ability of the company to originate mortgage loans and would reduce the value of mortgage loans held for sale 
a substantial decline in interest rates could also impair the value of any capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
the company s current risk management strategy involves selling substantially all originated mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis 
the company has million of capitalized mortgage servicing rights as of december   with a fair value at december  of million 
in an environment of stable interest rates  the company s gains on the sale of mortgage loans would generally be limited to those gains resulting from the yield differential between mortgage loan interest rates and rates required by secondary market purchasers 
a loss from the sale of loans may occur if interest rates increase between the time that the company establishes the interest rate on a loan and the time that the loan is sold 
fluctuating interest rates also may affect the net interest income earned by the company  resulting from the difference between the yield to the company on loans held for sale and the interest paid by the company for funds borrowed to finance the origination of mortgage loans 
because of the uncertainty of future loan origination volume and the future level of interest rates  there can be no assurance that the company will realize gains on the sale of financial assets in the future 
in the normal course of business  the company also enters into contractual commitments involving financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend mortgage loans to customers and forward contracts to sell mortgage backed securities to broker dealers 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of market rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheet 
nvr enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of single family homes with fixed expiration dates 
the commitments become effective when the borrowers lock in a specified interest rate within time frames established by nvr 
all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment 
market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the lock in of rates by the borrower and the sale date to a broker dealer 
this market risk is managed by entering into forward contracts as discussed below 
there were mortgage loan commitments aggregating approximately  outstanding at december   with a fair value at december  of  since certain of the commitments are expected to expire without a loan closing  the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
collateral for loans granted is obtained by a first mortgage security interest in real estate whose appraised values exceed the contractual amount of the commitment 
the company enters into optional and mandatory forward delivery contracts to sell mortgage backed securities and whole loans at specific prices and dates to broker dealers and secondary market investors 
the company has established policies governing which broker dealers can be used to conduct these activities 
market risk with respect to forward contracts arises from changes in the value of contractual positions due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company limits its exposure to market risk by monitoring differences between the total of commitments to customers and loans held for sale and forward contracts with investors and broker dealers 
in the event that the company has forward delivery contract commitments in excess of available mortgage backed securities  the company completes the transaction by either paying or receiving a fee to from the broker dealer equal to the increase decrease in the market value of the forward contract 
nvr has no market risk associated with optional delivery contracts because nvr has the right but not the obligation to deliver mortgage backed securities and whole loans to investors and broker dealers under these contracts 
there were open forward delivery contracts to sell loans to third party investors aggregating approximately  at december   with a fair value at december  of  the company s homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquisitions of capital assets through fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the homebuilding segment s primary variable rate debt is a working capital credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to  of which  is committed  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the working capital credit facility expires may  and outstanding amounts bear interest at the election of the company  at i the base rate of interest announced by the working capital credit facility agent or ii above the eurodollar rate 
the weighted average interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the facility was for the year ended there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital credit facility at december  the following table represents contractual balances of the company s on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments  at december  the expected maturity categories takes into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness 
because the company sells all of the mortgage loans it originates into the secondary markets  the company has made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year 
consequently  outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year
