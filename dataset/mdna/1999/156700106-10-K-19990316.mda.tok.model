in addition  the properties acquired in the pti acquisition historically have had a lower average monthly service revenue per customer than the company s incumbent properties 
the average monthly service revenue per customer may further decline i as market penetration increases and additional lower usage customers are activated and ii as competitive pressures from current and future wireless communications providers intensify 
the company is responding to such competitive pressures by  among other things  modifying certain of its price plans and implementing certain other plans and promotions  all of which are likely to result in lower average revenue per customer 
the company will continue to focus on customer service and attempt to stimulate cellular usage by promoting the availability of certain enhanced services and by improving the quality of its service through the construction of additional cell sites and other enhancements to its system 
operating expenses system operations expenses increased million in primarily due to million of expenses attributable to acquisitions

sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet

inflation the effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the ability to recover certain costs applicable to the company s regulated telephone operations through the rate making process 
as operating expenses in the company s nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation  the company  to the extent permitted by competition  recovers the costs by increasing prices for its services and equipment 
while the rate making process does not permit the company to immediately recover the costs of replacing its physical plant  the company has historically been able to recapture these costs over time 
possible future regulatory changes may alter the company s ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations

market risk the company is not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations since the majority of the company s long debt obligations are fixed rate 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the company s long term debt of and an overall weighted maturity of years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in interest rates ten percent of the company s overall weighted average borrowing rate 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt 
in early the company utilized interest rate hedge contracts to manage its interest rate risk related to the issuance of million of senior notes and debentures 
during the company did not enter into any derivative financial instruments and is currently not evaluating the future use of such financial instruments 
year readiness disclosure the year issue concerns the inability of computer systems and certain other equipment to properly recognize and process data that uses two digits rather than four to designate particular years 
the company has initiated a year project plan the plan to assess whether its systems that process date sensitive information will perform satisfactorily leading up to and beyond january  the goal of the plan is to correct  prior to january   any year related problem with critical systems  the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the plan includes steps to i identify each critical system element that requires date code remediation  ii establish a plan to remediate such systems  iii implement all required remediations and iv selectively test the remediated systems 
thus far  the identification phase has identified year issues in the following critical company owned systems i switching and transmission hardware and software used by the company to route and deliver telephone calls  ii network support systems  including customer service systems and iii billing and collection systems used by the company to invoice and process most of its customer payments 
in addition  the company i receives critical services from providers of utilities and other services to facilities that house employees and switching  transmission and other equipment and ii is dependent upon outside vendors for  among other things  the provision of critical network components and cellular billing services 
the company is also critically reliant upon the systems of other telecommunications carriers with which the company s systems interconnect for the routing and delivery of telephone calls 
the company has also identified potential year related liability with respect to telephone equipment manufactured by unaffiliated parties that the company has sold or leased to its customers customer premises equipment or cpe 
the identification and planning phases of the plan are materially complete as they relate to company owned systems 
as they relate to third party vendors  other telecommunications carriers and cpe customers  the identification and planning phases are on going and are expected to be materially complete by first quarter based on work completed under the plan to date  the company currently intends to take the following additional steps under its plan with respect to company owned systems  third party vendors  other telecommunications carriers  and cpe customers o the company generally plans to remediate company owned switching  transmission  billing and collection and other critical systems through the revision or replacement of current system components 
necessary changes to company owned systems are in process and are expected to be completed by mid year the selective testing and verification of such changes are expected to be completed during due to the large number of system components requiring remediation  the company does not intend to test every remediated system but will rely upon the results of selective testing to determine the effectiveness of remediation efforts 
o with respect to critical services provided by utilities and other third parties  the company has contacted all such suppliers during thus far  a majority of those suppliers who have responded have indicated that their systems and service delivery mechanisms are year compliant or can be made so through currently available modifications 
the company plans to continue monitoring all third party remediation efforts and to make contingency plans for the delivery of such services as necessary 
o the year compliance status of other telecommunications carriers with which the company s switching systems interconnect is not yet known 
the company is making inquiries with these carriers to determine their compliance status and expects to obtain the results of compliance tests during first quarter  although there can be no assurance that carriers will supply this information 
o finally  the company is in the process of obtaining year compliance information from cpe manufacturers and plans to provide this information to the company s business customers in early the company plans to work with cpe manufacturers to encourage the development of remedies for year problems in such equipment and to continue working with its customers to identify year problems in cpe 
however  there can be no assurance that cpe manufacturers or customers will cooperate with the company s efforts to address these problems 
while the company currently believes that it will be able to remediate and selectively test company owned systems in time to minimize any detrimental effect on its operations  there can be no assurance that such steps will be successful 
failure by the company to timely and effectively remediate its systems  or the failure of critical vendors and suppliers and other telecommunications carriers to remediate affected systems  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
because the impact of year issues on the company is materially dependent on the mitigation efforts of parties outside the company s control  the company cannot assess with certainty the magnitude of any such potential adverse impact 
however  based upon risk assessment work conducted thus far  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of the failure by the company  its suppliers or other telecommunications carriers with which the company interconnects to resolve year issues would be an inability by the company i to provide telecommunications services to the company s customers  ii to route and deliver telephone calls originating from or terminating with other telecommunications carriers  iii to timely and accurately process service requests and iv to timely and accurately bill its customers 
in addition to lost earnings  these failures could also result in loss of customers due to service interruptions and billing errors  substantial claims by customers and increased expenses associated with stabilizing operations and executing mitigation plans 
contingency planning to maintain and restore service in the event of natural disasters  power failures and systems related problems is a routine part of the company s operations 
the company believes that such contingency plans will assist the company in responding to the failure by outside service providers to successfully address year issues 
in addition  the company is currently identifying and considering various year specific contingency plans  including identification of alternate vendors and service providers and manual alternatives to system operations 
these year specific contingency plans are expected to be materially completed during the first quarter of  but their review and development will continue during although the total costs to implement the plan cannot be precisely estimated  the company incurred costs of million during none of which was related to hardware costs and anticipates spending an aggregate of approximately million during which includes million of hardware costs 
these costs will be expensed as incurred  unless new systems are purchased that should be capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
some of the costs represent ongoing investment in systems upgrades  the timing of which is being accelerated in order to facilitate year compliance 
in some instances  such upgrades will position the company to provide more and better quality services to its customers than they currently receive 
the company expects to fund these costs with cash provided by operations 
cost estimates and statements of the company s plans discussed above are forward looking statements that are derived using numerous assumptions of future events  many of which are outside the company s control  including the availability and future cost of trained personnel and various other resources  third party modification plans  the absence of systems requiring remediation that have not yet been discovered  and other factors 
liquidity and capital resources excluding cash used for acquisitions  the company relies on cash provided by operations to provide substantially all of its cash needs 
the company s operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped the company continue its long term program of capital improvements 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively

the net proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce the bank indebtedness incurred by the company in connection with its december acquisition of pti 
in addition  the company paid approximately million in to settle numerous interest rate hedge contracts that had been entered into in anticipation of these debt issuances 
in december after giving consideration to the pti acquisition  standard poor s assigned century s senior unsecured debt a rating of bbb and moody s reaffirmed its rating of baa other budgeted capital expenditures for total million for telephone operations  million for cellular operations and million for corporate and other operations 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures in its telephone operations will continue to include the installation of fiber optic cable and the upgrading of its plant and equipment  including its digital switches  to provide enhanced services 
capital expenditures in the cellular operations are expected to continue to focus on constructing additional cell sites which will provide additional capacity and expanded areas where hand held cellular phones may be used and providing digital service 
capital expenditures for corporate and other operations include million for construction of the company s fiber network in michigan and million for continued expansion of the company s pcs operations 
in april the company acquired local multipoint distribution system licenses in the fcc s a and b band auctions for an aggregate of million 
the licenses acquired cover geographic areas with a combined population of approximately million 
the company has not finalized capital expenditure or deployment plans for these systems 
the company continually evaluates the possibility of acquiring additional telecommunications operations and expects to continue its long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractive communications properties in exchange for cash  securities or both 
over the past few years  the amount of communications properties available to be purchased by the company has increased substantially 
the company may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions 
approximately million shares of century common stock and  shares of century preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under an acquisition shelf registration statement 
as of december   the company s telephone subsidiaries had available for use million of commitments for long term financing from the rural utilities service and the company had million of undrawn committed bank lines of credit 
the company also has access to debt and equity capital markets  including its shelf registration statement mentioned above 
the following table reflects the company s debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of and for the years ended december debt to total capitalization percentage ratio of earnings to fixed charges ratio of earnings to fixed charges excluding gain on sale or exchange of assets regulation and competition the communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory  competitive and technological changes that make it difficult to determine the form or degree of future regulation and competition affecting the company s telephone and cellular operations 
these changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies 
events affecting the communications industry in the united states congress enacted the telecommunications act of the act  which obligates lecs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the lec s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition 
the act provides certain exemptions for rural lecs such as those operated by the company 
under the fcc s august order implementing most of the act s interconnection provisions  rural lecs have the burden of proving the availability of these exemptions 
prior to and since the enactment of the act  the fcc and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have taken steps to foster local exchange competition 
coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the gradual reduction of regulatory oversight of lecs 
these cumulative changes have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with lecs services 
wireless services entities are also expected to increasingly compete with lecs 
the act authorized the establishment of federal and state universal service funds to provide support to eligible telecommunications carriers 
in may the fcc adopted an order on universal service  as mandated by the act 
in the order  the fcc ruled that rural telephone companies which are designated eligible telecommunications carriers will continue to receive universal service funding 
each of the company s lecs has been so designated by its respective state regulatory agency 
as a result  the company s lecs will continue to receive payments under the federal support mechanisms currently in effect until the fcc adopts funding support mechanisms based on forward looking economic costs  which it is required to do  but no earlier than january as part of its universal service order  the fcc also established a new program in january to provide up to billion of discounted telecommunications services annually to schools and libraries 
in addition  the fcc established a million annual fund to provide discounted telecommunications services for rural health care providers 
all communications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services  including the company s lecs and its cellular and long distance operations  are required to contribute to these programs 
the fcc has stated that lecs will recover their funding contributions in their rates for interstate services 
the company s contribution by its cellular and long distance operations for  which was passed on to its customers  was approximately million 
in an access charge reform order adopted in may  the fcc changed its system of interstate access charges to make them compatible with the deregulatory framework established by the act 
such changes are primarily applicable to price cap companies 
the company s telephone subsidiaries determine interstate revenues under rate of return regulation and are  therefore  only minimally impacted by the access charge reform order 
in july the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the access charge rules for rate of return companies in a manner similar to that adopted for price cap companies  subject to reviewing whether differences exist between price cap companies and rate of return companies that would require different rules in order to achieve the goal of fostering an efficient  competitive marketplace 
comments were filed with the fcc in august  the fcc has not yet issued a final ruling on this matter 
in the fcc created a federal state joint board to review jurisdictional separations procedures through which the costs of regulated telecommunications services are allocated to the interstate and intrastate jurisdictions 
in recent years the fcc has allocated additional frequency spectrum for wireless technologies that compete or are expected to compete with cellular  including pcs and mobile satellite services 
the fcc has also authorized certain specialized mobile radio service licensees to operate in a manner competitive with cellular systems 
in september the fcc initiated a proceeding to represcribe the authorized rate of return for interstate access services provided by lecs 
the fcc periodically represcribes this rate of return to ensure that the service rates filed by incumbent lecs subject to rate of return regulation continue to be just and reasonable 
it is uncertain whether or by how much the fcc may lower the authorized rate of return 
competition to provide traditional telephone or wireless services is expected to initially affect large urban areas to a greater extent than rural  suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the company s operations are located 
the company does not believe such competition is likely to materially affect it in the near term 
the company further believes that it may benefit from having the opportunity to observe the effects of these developments in large urban markets 
the company will continue to monitor ongoing changes in regulation  competition and technology and consider which developments provide the most favorable opportunities for the company to pursue 
recent events affecting the company during the company s revenues from the usf increased approximately million of which million was applicable to the pti properties to million after increasing million during although the company anticipates that it may experience a reduction in its federal support revenues at some point in the future  management believes it is premature to assess or estimate the ultimate impact thereof 
there can be no assurance  however  that such impact will not be material 
during the last few years  several states in which the company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the lec business 
while the company is aware of only a few companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the company s service areas  it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future 
in june the louisiana public service commission lpsc adopted a consumer price protection plan the consumer plan  effective july  which froze the local rates and access rates that can be charged by the company s lecs operating in louisiana 
although the consumer plan has no specified term  the lpsc is required to review it by mid the company s louisiana lecs have the option to propose a new plan at any time if the lpsc determines that i effective competition exists or ii unforeseen events threaten the lec s ability to provide adequate service or impair its financial health 
certain other states have implemented various forms of alternative regulation plans  the impact of which has not been material either individually or in the aggregate to the results of operations of the company 
certain long distance carriers continue to request that the company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its lecs 
there is no assurance that these requests will not result in reduced intrastate access revenues in the future 
the company anticipates that regulatory changes and competitive pressures may result in future revenue reductions in its telephone operations 
however  the company anticipates that such reductions may be minimized by increases in revenues attributable to the continued demand for enhanced services and new product offerings 
while the company expects its telephone revenues to continue to grow  its internal telephone revenue growth rate may slow during upcoming periods 
other matters the company s regulated telephone operations are subject to the provisions of sfas  under which the company is required to account for the economic effects of the rate making process  including the recognition of depreciation of plant and equipment over lives approved by regulators 
the ongoing applicability of sfas to the company s regulated telephone operations is being monitored due to the changing regulatory  competitive and legislative environments 
when the regulated operations of the company no longer qualify for the application of sfas  the net adjustments required will result in a material  extraordinary  noncash charge against earnings 
while the amount of such charge cannot be precisely estimated at this time  management believes that the noncash  after tax  extraordinary charge would be between million and million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has certain obligations based on federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment 
costs of compliance through have not been material  and the company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term obligations since the majority of the company s long term obligations are fixed rate 
at december   the company estimates that the fair value of the company s long term debt was billion which was determined by comparing the overall weighted average rate of the company s long term debt of and an overall weighted maturity of years to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in interest rates ten percent of the company s overall weighted average borrowing rate 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt 
in late and early the company utilized interest rate hedge contracts to manage its interest rate risk related to its january issuance of million of senior notes and debentures 
during the company did not enter into any derivative financial instruments and is not currently evaluating the future use of such financial instruments
