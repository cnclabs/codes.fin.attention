the company has initiated a focused business strategic plan designed to increase funds from operations ffo and enhance the value of its stock 
the plan concentrates principally on three areas i external growth  ii internal growth and iii the increase in the amount of stock owned in the company by affiliates of the advisor and the property manager 
the company s external growth will be accomplished through continued acquisitions  on an individual or bulk basis  of shopping centers 
the company believes that there are significant opportunities available to acquire undervalued  undermanaged and or underutilized neighborhood and community shopping centers 
unlike most small capitalized reits  the company has the ability to benefit from its affiliation with a much larger company  related  with a national presence 
the company is using its affiliation with related to establish a national acquisition program 
the company believes that by acquiring shopping centers on a national basis  rather than targeting a few markets or a region  it will be able to grow at a meaningful rate  without the need for it to compromise asset quality or current return 
in addition  a national acquisition program allows the company to maintain geographic diversity  which the company believes reduces the risk otherwise associated with focusing on one region 
the company seeks to acquire primarily  but not exclusively  supermarket anchored shopping centers  which are well located in primary and secondary markets 
acquisitions will be balanced between stabilized centers that the company believes are undervalued and centers that may be enhanced through intensive management  leasing  redevelopment or expansion efforts 
in all such cases  the company generally seeks to acquire only those centers that are expected to immediately increase ffo 
during the period january  through march   the company acquired neighborhood shopping centers for an aggregate purchase price of  not including acquisition fees and expenses of approximately  the acquisitions were financed through proceeds of an expandable million senior revolving credit facility shared equally among bankboston  keybank national association and citizens bank of rhode island the credit facility  the assumption of  of existing debt with respect to four of the acquisitions  the issuance of purchase money notes to sellers amounting to  with respect to two of the acquisitions and the issuance of  op units subject to adjustment valued at  with respect to three of the acquisitions 
internal growth will occur from the continued re deployment of proceeds from the sale or other disposition of non core assets currently in the portfolio and through intensive management  leasing and redevelopment services provided to the company by the property manager and the advisor 
the company considers non core assets to be those assets the company has enhanced and no longer offer above market rates of return or those assets which due to location  configuration or tenant profile no longer offer the company the prospects of better than market rates of growth 
the company regularly reviews its portfolio to identify non core assets and to determine whether the time is appropriate to sell or otherwise dispose of such assets whose characteristics are no longer suited to the company s overall growth strategy or operating goals 
during  the company disposed of three non core assets 
on march   dominion chateau creste limited partnership  the general partner of dominion  purchased the company s limited partnership interest in dominion pursuant to its rights under the partnership agreement 
the purchase price was determined by independent appraisals and resulted in a cash payment to the company of  which was  in excess of the carrying value of this investment at the date of sale 
on june  walsh cross creek lp the owner  the owner of cross creek apartments cross creek and an affiliate of the advisor  sold cross creek to a third party for million 
the owner then fully repaid its outstanding debt due to the company totaling  including a  fha mortgage  a  equity loan  a  additional loan made by the company to the owner  a  prepayment penalty due the company on the fha mortgage and accrued interest through the closing date of  resulting in a loss on the repayment including the prepayment penalty in the amount of  due to purchase accounting premiums recorded pursuant to the consolidation which is included in other expenses 
the company used the proceeds from the dominion and cross creek asset dispositions to reduce its outstanding debt under the credit facility

fai  the limited partnership which owns weatherly walk apartments and one of the fha mortgagors  repaid in full after completing a refinancing with an unaffiliated third party the outstanding balance of its mortgage loan in the amount of  plus accrued interest through august  of  resulting in a loss on the repayment in the amount of  due to purchase accounting premiums recorded pursuant to the consolidation which is included in other expenses

this equity interest will earn a monthly pre ferred return of on  plus of excess cash flow and sale or refinancing proceeds 
in september  the company used the repayment proceeds from the weatherly walk asset disposition as well as proceeds from the credit facility to purchase two shopping centers 
finally  the company will encourage the advisor and its affiliates to increase their ownership in the company 
the company believes that this is necessary in order to more closely align the interest of management with that of the company and to demonstrate that the advisor has a long term commitment to the success of the company 
during  the ownership of the outstanding common stock of the company by affiliates of the advisor increased from 
to 
in addition  during  ownership of op units by affiliates of the advisor increased from  op units to  op units 
assuming conversion of all outstanding op units  the ownership in the company by affiliates of the advisor increased from to 
the company s growth will be financed through proceeds of the credit facility  the issuance of shares of the company s common stock or op units in exchange for real estate  funds generated from operations in excess of distributions and from placements of equity 
although the credit facility may be increased  the company s charter dictates leverage of no more than of the company s total market value

this agreement effectively changes the company s interest rate exposure on a portion of the credit facility debt to a fixed and matures on december  the company accounts for the net cash settlements under this swap agreement as adjustments to the interest expense on the credit facility 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the interest rate swap agreement  however  the company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counter party 
the estimated fair value of this agreement was a liability of approximately  on december  as a reit  the company is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to maintain reit status 
funds generated from operations are expected to be more than sufficient to allow the company to meet this requirement 
the advisor believes that the stability of the company s operations and its ability to maintain liquidity are enhanced by i geographic diversity of its portfolio of real estate and its mortgage note

forward looking statements certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended

year compliance the company utilizes the computer services of an affiliate of the advisor 
the affiliate of the advisor has upgraded its computer information systems to be year compliant and beyond 
the year compliance issue concerns the inability of a computerized system to accurately record dates after the affiliate of the advisor recently underwent a conversion of its financial systems applications and upgraded all of its non compliant  in house software and hardware inventory 
the work stations that experienced problems from the testing process were corrected with an upgrade patch 
the costs incurred by the advisor are not being charged to the company 
the most likely worst case scenario that the company faces is that computer operations will be suspended for a few days to a week at january  the company s contingency plan is to have a complete backup done on december  and to have both electronic and printed reports generated for all critical data up to and including december with regard to third parties  the company s advisor is in the process of evaluating the potential adverse impact that could result from the failure of material service providers to be year compliant 
a detailed survey and assessment was sent to material third parties in the fourth quarter of the company has received assurances from a majority of its third parties with which it interacts that they have addressed the year issues and is evaluating these assurances for their adequacy and accuracy 
in cases where the company has not received assurances from third parties  it is initiating further mail and or phone correspondence 
the company relies heavily on third parties and is vulnerable to the failures of third parties to address their year issues 
there can be no assurance given that the third parties will adequately address their issues 
inflation inflation did not have a material effect on the company s results for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the nature of the company s investments and the credit facility used to raise capital for their acquisition expose the company to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
cash flows from the company s investments do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under the credit facility vary based on market interest rates  primarily the day euro contract rate 
thus  an increase in market interest rates would result in increased payments under the credit facility  without a corresponding increase in cash flows from the company s investments 
for example  based on the  outstanding under the credit facility at december   the company estimates that an increase of in the day euro contract rate would decrease the company s annual net income by approximately  a increase in the day euro contract rate would decrease annual net income by approximately  for the same reasons  a decrease in market interest rates would generally benefit the company  as a result of decreased payments under the credit facility without corresponding decreases in cash flows from the company s investments 
for example  based on the  outstanding under the credit facility at december   the company estimates that a decline in the day euro contract rate would increase the company s annual net income by approximately  and a decline in the day euro contract rate would increase net income by approximately  various financial vehicles exist which would allow company management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
on december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the credit facility floating rate debt 
management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies
