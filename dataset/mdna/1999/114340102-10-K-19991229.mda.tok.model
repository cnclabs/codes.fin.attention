such factors include the factors that may affect future results set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which is included in this report 
precautionary statements made herein should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
overview the predecessor of brooks was organized in february and acquired the semiconductor wafer handling business of the brooks automation division of aeronca electronics  inc  a subsidiary of fleet aerospace corporation  in march brooks is a leading supplier of tool and factory hardware and software automation solutions for the global semiconductor  data storage  and flat panel display manufacturing industries 
founded in  brooks has distinguished itself as a technology and market leader  particularly in the demanding cluster tool vacuum processing environment and in integrated factory automation software applications 
the company s offerings have evolved from individual robots used to transfer semiconductor wafers in advanced production equipment to fully integrated automation solutions from process tools to factory scheduling used to optimize fab performance 
in and the company diversified and entered the factory automation market  beginning with the acquisition of fastech integration  inc through a recent series of acquisitions brooks has emerged as one of the leading suppliers of factory automation software and hardware solutions to end users in these markets 
in  the company introduced the family of vacuum central wafer handling systems and modules that forms the foundation of the company s current business 
in  the company introduced a similar family of systems and modules for flat panel display substrates  including a next generation magnetically driven vacuum transfer robot 
in  the company acquired techware systems corporation techware  a designer and supplier of integrated equipment control software for the semiconductor and related industries  expanding its software and control capability 
in  the company introduced a line of products for the atmospheric handling market  including in line and controlled environment systems  robots  aligners and traversers 
in  the company acquired fastech integration  inc fastech  a designer and supplier of top to bottom integrated manufacturing execution systems mes software solutions 
both of these acquisitions were accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
the company made several acquisitions during fiscal year on april   the company completed the acquisition of hanyon technology  inc hanyon 
hanyon  based in korea  provides mes systems integration services and cell control automation solutions to the semiconductor and liquid crystal display industries in korea and taiwan 
on june   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of domain manufacturing corporation domain 
domain is a leading developer of process development  data analysis and advanced process control software 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the company s consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows include the results of hanyon and domain for the periods subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition 
on august   the company completed the acquisition of smart machines inc smart machines 
smart machines produces process tool automation components for semiconductor manufacturers 
this acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the company s historical financial results have been restated to include the results of smart for all periods presented 
on september   the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of the infab division infab of jenoptik ag  a leading supplier of advanced factory interface systems 
this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the acquired assets are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of september  in june  the company formed a joint venture in korea with samsung electronics 
this joint venture is owned by the company and owned by samsung  and has been organized to design  develop  and manufacture atmospheric flat panel display loaders along with other products 
the company consolidates fully the financial position and results of operations of the joint venture and accounts for the minority interest in the financial statements 
many of the company s customers purchase the company s vacuum transfer robots and other modules before purchasing the company s vacuum central wafer handling systems 
the company believes that once a customer has selected the company s products for a process tool  the customer is likely to rely on those products for the life of that process tool model  which can be in excess of five years 
conversely  losing a bid for a mes does not preclude the company from securing optimization products to fit with a competitor s manufacturing execution systems 
the company s product revenues include sales of hardware and software products 
the company s service revenues include revenue from maintenance contracts  fixed fee application consulting contracts  and time and material based contracts 
the majority of the company s revenues have been generated by sales to customers in the united states  although the company believes that a significant portion of these customers incorporate the company s products into equipment sold to their foreign customers 
the company s foreign sales have occurred principally in japan  south korea  taiwan  singapore and europe 
the company s foreign revenues are generally denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
the costs and expenses of the company s international subsidiaries are generally denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
however  since the functional currency of the company s international subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
to the extent that the company expands its international operations or changes its pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  the company will be exposed to increased risk of currency fluctuation 
the company s business is highly dependent upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers which historically have been cyclical  and the company s ability to develop  manufacture and sell new products and product enhancements 
the company s results will also be affected  especially when measured on a quarterly basis  by the volume  composition and timing of orders  conditions in industries served by the company  competition and general economic conditions 
results of operations impact of acquisition related  restructuring and other costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded million of acquisition related  restructuring and other costs 
these charges were comprised of million in inventory related costs  million for transaction costs related to the smart machines acquisition  million for restructuring charges and million of additional depreciation expense due to shortening the lives of certain assets 
the restructuring charges include costs to terminate certain employees and the write off of certain fixed assets during fiscal under a plan approved and implemented by management during fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded acquisition related  restructuring and other costs of million 
these charges included million of inventory related costs  million of fastech acquisition related costs  million of restructuring charges  million of accounts receivable reserves  million of additional depreciation charges and million of interest expense 
the following table reflects the results of operations for the three years ended september   including the effect of the acquisition related  restructuring and other costs for the years ended september  and year ended september  year ended september  acquisition acquisition related  related  as reported restructuring restructuring year ended and other and other september  as reported costs pro forma as reported costs pro forma revenues product      service      total revenues      cost of revenues product   a    d   service      total cost of revenues        gross profit        operating expenses research and development  b   b   selling  general and administrative  b    e   amortization of acquired intangible assets acquisition related and restructuring costs   c   f total operating expenses        loss from operations        interest income     interest expense g other income expense loss before income taxes        a comprised of million of inventory related charges and million of additional depreciation expense

f comprised of million of costs to exit duplicate facilities  million of legal  accounting and other transaction related costs and million for severance costs 
g charges reflect interest expense incurred on retirement of debt in conjunction with the company s acquisition of fastech 
fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september revenues total revenues increased  to million in fiscal  compared to revenues of million in fiscal product revenues increased million  or  primarily as a result of improving mm revenues 
service revenues increased million  or  primarily as a result of the company s acquisitions and the impact of the acquisitions on consulting services associated with factory automation 
foreign revenues for fiscal were million of revenues  including million of direct sales to asian customers  compared with foreign revenues of million of revenues  including million of direct sales to asian customers in the prior fiscal year 
the company expects that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues in fiscal however  there can be no assurance that foreign revenues  particularly from asia  will remain a strong component of the company s total revenues 
gross profit gross profit increased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal gross profit on product revenues increased to  compared to for fiscal included in the cost of product revenues for fiscal and fiscal are charges of million and million  respectively  for acquisition related  restructuring and other costs 
the fiscal charges are comprised of a million charge to provide additional reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories and million of additional depreciation expense  while the fiscal charge was comprised of million to provide additional reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories  million for additional depreciation costs and million for severance costs 
excluding these costs  gross profit on product revenues was for fiscal  an increase from for fiscal due to improving manufacturing capacity utilization and the acquisition of higher margin software product businesses 
in future periods  gross profit may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of products sold  continued pricing pressures or increases in cost of product revenues 
gross profit on service revenues was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal included in the cost of service revenues are global customer support costs  consisting primarily of personnel costs and travel expenses 
global customer support costs were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
research and development research and development expenses decreased by  to million for fiscal  from million in the prior year 
research and development expenses also decreased as a percentage of revenues  to in fiscal  compared to in the prior year 
the spending decrease was the effect of reduced personnel costs and other related spending associated with the changing mix of supported technologies 
the company believes that research and development expenditures are essential to maintaining its competitive position as a leading supplier of tool and factory hardware and software automation solutions in the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display manufacturing industries  the company expects gross expenditure levels to continue at or above current levels in the future 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to million of revenues in fiscal  compared to million of revenues in fiscal fiscal expenses included million for additional deprecation expense 
fiscal expenses included million for additional accounts receivable reserves and additional depreciation expense 
the spending increase over last year is due to expanded sales and marketing activities as well as increased general and administration support costs associated with the company s recently completed acquisitions and infrastructure improvements 
the company expects that future expenditure levels will continue at or above current levels to support its worldwide sales and administrative organizations 
acquisition related and restructuring costs in fiscal  the company incurred acquisition related and restructuring costs of million  comprised of million for transaction costs related to the smart machines acquisition  million for severance costs and million for the write off of certain fixed assets 
the fiscal acquisition related and restructuring costs of million were comprised of million to exit duplicate facilities  million for legal  accounting and other transaction costs related to the fastech acquisition and million for severance costs 
interest income and interest expense interest income decreased by  to million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  due primarily to lower cash and investment asset balances 
interest expense decreased by  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  due primarily to costs for acquisition related deferred financing costs to retire debt in conjunction with the acquisition of fastech and reduced borrowings 
income tax provision benefit the company recorded net tax benefits of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these tax benefits are primarily due to anticipated future tax benefit of domestic net operating losses and research and development credits  which were partially offset by million and million increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september revenues total revenues decreased to million in fiscal  compared with revenues of million in fiscal product revenues decreased million primarily as a result of a decrease in flat panel display revenues and software revenues  which was partially offset by an increase in mm and mm revenues 
service revenues decreased million 
the decreases in product and services revenues are primarily the result of the prolonged economic downturn which adversely impacted the semiconductor industry and related tool and factory hardware and software automation sector 
foreign revenues for fiscal were million of revenues  including million of direct sales to asian customers  compared with foreign revenues of million of revenues  including million of direct sales to asian customers in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit overall  gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal  compared with for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of product revenues decreased to  compared with for fiscal included in the cost of product revenues for fiscal were million of charges related primarily to increased inventory reserves and severance costs 
the gross profit percentage for product revenues before these costs in fiscal was 
the decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily a result of continued underutilization of manufacturing capacity due in part to customer requested shipment delays primarily in the first half of fiscal and pricing pressure from volume production customers 
gross profit percentage on service revenues as a percentage of service revenues was for fiscal  compared with for the prior year 
included in service revenues are global support costs  which decreased to million for fiscal  from million in the prior fiscal year 
global support costs consist primarily of personnel costs and travel expenses 
research and development research and development expenses increased  to million of revenues from million of revenues in the prior fiscal year 
the increase primarily resulted from incremental spending associated with the launch of new atmospheric products and the transition to next generation vacuum wafer handling products  as the company continued to make investments in research and development to enhance existing and develop new tool and factory hardware and software automation solutions for the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display manufacturing industries 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues for fiscal  from million of revenues in the prior fiscal year 
fiscal expenses include million for additional accounts receivable reserves and additional depreciation expense 
before these charges  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues  primarily due to the worldwide expansion of the company s sales and administrative organizations during the first half of the year 
acquisition related and restructuring costs in fiscal the company incurred acquisition related costs of million that consisted principally of million of costs to exit duplicate facilities  million of legal  accounting  and other transaction costs related to the fastech acquisition and million of severance costs 
interest income and interest expense interest income increased to million for fiscal  from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest income was due to higher cash and investment balances during fiscal  resulting primarily from the company s million public stock offering in september interest expense of million in fiscal remained relatively unchanged from million in the prior fiscal year 
income tax provision benefit the company recorded a net tax benefit of million for fiscal  primarily due to the anticipated future tax benefit of domestic net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards generated during  which were partially offset by the million increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a decrease of million from september  cash provided by operations during the year ended september  was million  despite a net loss of million for the year  and is primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of million  as well as decreases in inventories of million and increases in accounts payable  deferred revenue and accrued acquisition related and restructuring costs of million  million and million  respectively  offset by increases in deferred income taxes and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended september  was million  and includes million used for capital additions and cash payments of million for business acquisitions  partially offset by million of cash from acquired companies 
cash provided by financing activities was million  and is primarily attributable to proceeds of million from the issuance of the company s common stock and million of long term borrowings  partially offset by payments of long term debt of million 
on december   the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire auto soft corporation and autosimulations  inc from their sole stockholder  daifuku america corporation  the us affiliate of daifuku co  ltd  subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
upon the completion of the transaction  which is expected to occur in january  the company will be required to pay million in cash  issue shares of common stock with an aggregate value of million and issue a note in the amount of million payable one year after the date of closing 
the note will be unsecured and bear interest at per year 
in september  the company obtained a commitment letter for an unsecured revolving credit facility for borrowings and letters of credit up to million 
the proposed credit facility will terminate at the end of two years 
the interest rates for borrowings under the proposed facility are expressed in relation to libor and a margin of to or from to above a base rate 
the borrowings and letters of credit are expected to be used for working capital and general purposes  including financing potential acquisitions 
the company believes that this borrowing facility  together with current cash and cash equivalent balances  will be adequate to fund the acquisition of auto soft corporation and autosimulations  inc  planned working capital and capital expenditures and acquisition requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company cannot guarantee that it will obtain the borrowing facility on favorable terms  if at all 
year readiness disclosure the year issue is the potential for system and processing failure of date related data as the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
internal infrastructure compliance 
brooks may be affected by year issues related to non compliant information technology systems and other systems operated or sold by brooks or by third parties 
brooks has completed the assessment of its internal information technology systems and applications and believes that all critical applications are year compliant 
brooks also has evaluated its information technology hardware and its non information technology systems  including facilities and other operations  such as financial  security and utility systems 
brooks believes these systems are year compliant 
product compliance 
brooks has completed a year readiness evaluation of its current generation of released products and believes that products distributed after december  are year compliant 
brooks cannot guarantee that product testing has identified all year related issues that could have an adverse affect on brooks financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions 
brooks has acquired five businesses since september including infab  smart machines  domain  hanyon and fastech 
brooks has signed a definitive agreement to acquire auto soft corporation and autosimulations  inc  scheduled to close in january and is in various stages of negotiation with respect to the acquisition of several additional businesses 
as part of brooks due diligence examination of completing acquisitions  the company conducted an evaluation of their year readiness 
brooks believes there are no significant year related issues arising from the companies that it has acquired 
brooks can give no assurance that it will properly identify year issues relating to any companies acquired in the future 
third party compliance 
although brooks believes that its own systems are year compliant  the company utilizes third party equipment and software that may not be year compliant 
in addition  brooks products and software are often sold  integrated into or interfaced with third party equipment or software 
failure of third party equipment or software to operate properly with regard to the year and thereafter could require brooks to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on brooks business  results of operations and financial condition 
brooks may also be vulnerable to any failures by its major suppliers  service providers and customers to remedy their own internal information technology and non information technology systems year issues which could have a material adverse effect on brooks supplies and orders 
at this time  brooks is unable to estimate the nature or extent of any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third parties  such as its suppliers  service providers and customers  to achieve year compliance 
moreover  such third parties  even if year compliant  could experience difficulties resulting from year issues that may affect their suppliers  service providers and customers 
as a result  although brooks does not currently anticipate  based upon surveys and discussions  that it will experience any material shipment delays from its major product suppliers or any material sales delays from its major customers due to year issues  although there can be no assurance that these third parties will not experience year problems or that any such problems will not have an adverse material effect on brooks business  results of operations and financial condition 
because the cost and timing of year compliance by third parties such as suppliers  service providers and customers is not within brooks control  brooks cannot give any assurance with respect to the cost or timing of such efforts or any potential adverse effects on brooks of any failure by these third parties to achieve year compliance 
brooks relies on commercial and government suppliers for services related to brooks infrastructure  including utilities  transportation  financial  governmental  communications and other services 
these suppliers pose an undetermined risk to brooks facilities and operations worldwide 
in some cases  alternate suppliers of these services  such as electrical utilities  are unavailable  and failure by a supplier could adversely impact brooks 
costs 
based on its investigation to date  brooks does not expect the total cost of its year assessment and planning to have a material adverse effect on brooks business or financial results 
on a cumulative basis  brooks has incurred approximately million in year compliance costs 
contingency plan 
brooks has developed contingency plans  as appropriate  and believes its year compliance efforts to be materially complete in the event year problems relating to its operations arise 
brooks failure to develop a contingency plan could have a material adverse effect on brooks business  results of operations and financial condition 
worst case scenario 
to the extent that brooks does not identify any material non compliant information technology systems or non information technology systems operated by brooks or by third parties  such as brooks suppliers  service providers and customers  the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario is a systemic failure beyond the control of brooks  such as a prolonged telecommunications or electrical failure  or a general disruption in united states or global business activities that could result in a significant economic downturn 
brooks believes that the primary business risks  in the event of such failure or other disruption  would include but not be limited to  loss of customers or orders  increased operating costs  inability to obtain inventory on a timely basis  disruptions in product shipments  or other business interruptions of a material nature  as well as claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation  or breach of contract  any of which could have a material adverse effect on brooks business  results of operations and financial condition 
recently enacted accounting pronouncements in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  which addresses software revenue recognition as it applies to certain multiple element arrangements 
sop also amends sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  to extend the deferral of application of certain passages of sop through fiscal years beginning on or before march  all other provisions of sop are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after march  the company will comply with the requirements of this sop as they become effective and does not expect that its revenues or earnings will be materially affected 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement was amended by the issuance of sfas  deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which changed the effective date of sfas to all fiscal years beginning after june  fiscal for the company and requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
management of the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from targets or projected results 
brooks dependence on the cyclical semiconductor industry materially affects the demand for brooks products 
brooks business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors 
brooks revenues in the past have been materially adversely affected by semiconductor industry downturns or slowdowns and may be materially adversely affected by future downturns 
brooks believes on the basis of its experience during the recent downturn that downturns in the semiconductor manufacturing industry will occur in the future  and will result in decreased demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and factory automation products 
brooks reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of its revenues could have a material adverse effect on brooks results of operations 
a significant portion of brooks revenues in each fiscal period have been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
if brooks lost one or more of these major customers  or if one or more major customers decreased its orders  brooks business would be materially and adversely affected 
sales to brooks ten largest customers accounted for of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal approximately of brooks total revenues in and in fiscal were derived from sales to lam research corporation  brooks largest customer and a related party 
brooks expects that sales to lam will continue to represent a significant portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
brooks future operating results depend on the success of these customers and brooks success in selling products to them at somewhat lower percentages of total revenue 
delays in shipment of a few systems could substantially decrease revenues for a period 
brooks has historically derived a substantial portion of its quarterly and annual revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of semiconductor and flat panel display handling systems 
these systems have relatively high selling prices compared to its other products 
as a result  the precise timing of the recognition of revenue from an order for one or a small number of systems can have a significant impact on brooks total revenues and operating results for a particular period 
brooks operating results for a particular period could be adversely affected if orders for a small number of systems are canceled or rescheduled by customers or cannot be filled in time to recognize revenue during that period due to unanticipated delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping or product acceptance 
similarly  timing of signing software licenses could affect software revenue in any given period 
brooks has significant fixed costs which are not easily reduced if revenues fall below expectations 
brooks expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenues 
many of brooks expenses  particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are relatively fixed 
brooks ability to reduce expenses is also constrained by the need for continual investment in research and development and the need to maintain extensive ongoing customer service and support capability for its existing customer base 
these investments create significant fixed costs that brooks may be unable to reduce rapidly  if at all  in the event of a semiconductor industry downturn or other reduction in revenue 
accordingly  any downturn in revenue could have a material adverse effect on brooks business  financial condition and results of operations 
brooks sales volume is affected by its original equipment manufacturing customers sales volume 
brooks products are principally sold to original equipment manufacturers which incorporate brooks products into their equipment 
due to the significant capital commitments usually incurred by semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers in their purchases of equipment from these original equipment manufacturers  they demand highly reliable products which may require several years for the original equipment manufacturers to develop 
brooks revenues are therefore primarily dependent upon the timing and effectiveness of the efforts of its customers in developing and marketing equipment which incorporates brooks products 
similarly  the growth of the company s software business is predicated on the building of new or significant upgrading of existing fabs 
should the volume of new fab development and or upgrades decrease  the company s revenues could be adversely affected 
brooks lengthy sales cycle requires brooks to incur significant expenses with no assurance that brooks will generate revenue 
brooks new products are generally incorporated into an original equipment manufacturers customer s process tools at the design stage 
however  customer decisions to use brooks products can often require significant expenditures by brooks without any assurance of success 
these customer decisions often precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
brooks cannot guarantee that it will continue to achieve design wins or that the process tools manufactured by brooks customers will be commercially successful 
brooks or its customers failure to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner could materially adversely affect brooks business and results of operations 
brooks operating results fluctuate significantly 
brooks operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
some of these factors may include the level of demand for semiconductors in general  cyclicality in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  the timing and size of orders from brooks customer base  the ability of brooks to manufacture  test and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  brooks success in winning competitions with competitors for orders  the timing of new product announcements and releases by brooks and its competitors  the mix of products sold by brooks  competitive pricing pressures  and level of automation required in fab extensions  upgrades and new facilities 
brooks business could be materially adversely affected if brooks fails to adequately integrate acquired businesses 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions and the integration of an acquired business diverts the time and resources of brooks management from the day to day operation of brooks business 
brooks has completed a number of acquisitions in a short period of time  subjecting it to significant risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of operations  products and corporate cultures  difficulties in completing the development of acquired technologies  difficulties in managing geographically remote units  the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which it has limited or no direct experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
any delay or failure to integrate an acquired company  technology or product line could result in the additional expenditure of money  charges to income and increased demands on the time of brooks management 
as a result of these and other risks  brooks may not realize anticipated benefits from recent acquisitions 
brooks failure to achieve these benefits could have a material adverse effect on brooks business  results of operations or financial condition 
future acquisitions may involve expending significant funds  incurring additional debt or the issuance of additional securities  which may materially affect brooks results of operations and be dilutive to shareholders 
future acquisitions may involve expending significant funds  incurring additional debt or the issuance of additional securities  which may materially adversely affect brooks results of operations and be dilutive to brooks shareholders 
in addition to the five acquisitions recently completed  in december the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire auto soft corporation and autosimulations  inc for approximately million  payable in cash  stock and notes 
if brooks expends significant funds or incurs additional debt  its ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline and brooks may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
brooks conducts its business internationally  which exposes it to a number of difficulties in coordinating its activities outside the united states and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
approximately of brooks total revenues in both fiscal and fiscal were derived from customers located outside the united states 
brooks anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues 
brooks international business may be materially adversely affected by difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries  greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection  possibly adverse tax consequences  governmental currency controls  changes in various regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  currency exchange rate changes  and export import controls  and tariff regulations 
to support its international customers  brooks maintains subsidiaries in several countries  including japan  south korea  germany  united kingdom  france  ireland  malaysia  netherlands  taiwan and singapore 
brooks cannot guarantee that it will be able to manage these operations effectively or that brooks investment in these activities will enable it to compete successfully in international markets or to meet the service and support needs of its customers 
for the foreseeable future brooks may continue to be affected by unstable asian economies  particularly those in japan and south korea 
it is not possible to determine the future effect a continuation of the asian economic crisis may have on brooks financial position and results of operations 
although brooks international sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates can make it more difficult for brooks to compete with foreign manufacturers on price 
if brooks international sales increase relative to brooks total revenues  these factors could have a more pronounced effect on brooks operating results 
brooks must continually improve its technology to remain competitive 
technology changes rapidly in the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display manufacturing industries 
brooks believes that this will continue to be true 
brooks success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products to meet customer requirements 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  and market acceptance of brooks products and its customers products 
in order to address emerging industry requirements for larger diameter mm wafer and fourth generation flat panel substrates  brooks current major development programs include expanding its product offerings for data storage manufacturers and for semiconductor and flat panel display substrate handling systems  as well as wafer handling systems and modules for atmospheric process tools 
in addition  brooks continues to develop and enhance its factory automation software product offerings  including its manufacturing execution systems  and equipment automation solutions and factory interface systems for factory wide integration 
brooks cannot guarantee that it will adjust to changing market conditions or be commercially successful in introducing products or product enhancements 
brooks faces significant competition which could result in decreased demand for brooks products or services 
the markets for brooks products are intensely competitive and brooks may not be able to compete successfully 
brooks believes that its primary competition is from integrated original equipment manufacturers that satisfy their semiconductor and flat panel display handling needs in house rather than by purchasing systems or modules from an independent supplier such as brooks 
many of these original equipment manufacturers have substantially greater resources than brooks 
applied materials  inc  the leading process equipment original equipment manufacturer  develops and manufactures its own central wafer and flat panel display substrate handling systems and modules 
brooks may not be successful in selling its products to original equipment manufacturers that currently satisfy their substrate handling needs in house  regardless of the performance or the price of brooks products 
moreover  integrated original equipment manufacturers may begin to commercialize their handling capabilities and become competitors of brooks 
brooks may have difficulty protecting its intellectual property 
brooks ability to compete is heavily affected by its ability to protect its intellectual property 
brooks relies primarily on trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  patents  copyrights  trademarks and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property 
the steps brooks has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection 
brooks patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which brooks products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect brooks products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
this may make the possibility of piracy of brooks technology and products more likely 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by brooks to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of brooks technology 
brooks operations could infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
particular aspects of brooks technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to brooks business 
brooks cannot predict the extent to which it may be required to seek licenses 
brooks cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses brooks may be required to seek will be reasonable 
brooks business may be materially adversely affected by infringement claims by general signal 
brooks has received notice from general signal corporation alleging infringements of its patent rights by certain of brooks products 
the notification advised brooks that general signal was attempting to enforce its rights to those patents in litigation against applied materials  and that  at the conclusion of that litigation  general signal intended to enforce its rights against brooks and others 
according to a press release issued by applied materials in november  applied materials settled its litigation with general signal by acquiring ownership of five general signal patents 
although not verified by brooks  these five patents would appear to be the patents referred to by general signal in its prior notice to brooks 
applied materials has not contacted brooks regarding these patents 
the skilled employees brooks needs are difficult to hire and retain 
brooks needs to hire additional management level employees and substantial numbers of employees with technical backgrounds for both brooks hardware and software engineering and support staffs
