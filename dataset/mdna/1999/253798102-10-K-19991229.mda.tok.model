on august   the company filed amendment no 
to the registrant s annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission for the purpose of restating its financial statements for the year ended september  net sales the million or increase in net sales from to and the million or increase in net sales from to occurred within the company s principal product groups as follows annual sales percent of annual net sales increase decrease server based physical layer other sales of isdn and voip products added in connection with the july acquisition of itk and usb and etherlite products added in connection with the july acquisitions of cdc generated million of net sales for the fiscal year  an increase of over the net sales recognized during of the year ago period  which included itk and cdc revenue in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
these revenue increases were mitigated by a revenue decrease of million for the company s legacy asynchronous products due to shrinking of the overall market and a shift in demand to digital technology products 
the company also experienced a decrease in demand for the company s physical layer products due to a decrease in prices and competition resulting in a decrease in revenues of million 
net sales of the company s new dsp ras products were million for the fiscal year  adding million over total dsp ras product revenue in fiscal net sales in fiscal increased from fiscal largely because the company reduced inventory levels in the north american distribution channel throughout and into the first quarter of fiscal this resulted in a net increase in sales within the distribution channel during the remainder of net sales to original equipment manufacturers oems increased over and as a percentage of total net sales  increased to versus in the increase was principally a function of sales added by itk 
net sales to oems for were of total sales 
net sales into the distribution channel increased over and as a percentage of total net sales  remained unchanged at in  compared to international distribution net sales increased by over fiscal primarily due to new product revenues and the expanded distribution channel added by itk 
domestic distribution net sales declined by due to a decrease in inventory levels in the distribution channel 
net sales to the distribution market for represented of total net sales 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales continued during fiscal years  and  the company s net sales to customers outside the united states  primarily in europe  were approximately million  million and million  respectively  comprising approximately  and of total net sales 
gross margin gross margin in decreased to  compared to in  primarily due to the negative impact of sales of lower gross margin itk products  an increased percentage of lower margin oem sales  market driven erosion of gross margin on physical layer products  and increases in the company s inventory valuation reserves 
gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal improved to when compared to gross margin of in the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in the company s production facilities 
gross margin in rose to compared to in due to cost control measures and favorable product sales mix 
gross margin also benefited as net sales of historically lower margin oem and physical layer products declined as a percentage of total net sales 
offsetting the favorable sales mix were increases in inventory valuation reserves  sales discounts granted  and a higher proportion of lower margin products sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the acquisition of cdc and itk 
operating expenses excluding acquired in process research and development charges of  recorded in  operating expenses in increased from sales and marketing expenses increased by million due to million of expenses added by itk and cdc  million expended to promote new dsp ras products  and a million cost decline primarily due to reduced north american channel marketing efforts 
research and development expenses increased million due to million of additional costs added by itk and cdc with the remaining increase of million due to new product development costs for the dsp ras products 
general and administrative expenses increased by million primarily due to increased amortization of acquisition related goodwill and other identifiable intangibles of million offset by million of cost reductions related reduced information systems implementation costs and other cost saving initiatives 
operating expenses in declined from  excluding acquired in process research and development charges of  recorded in and the restructuring charges recorded in and of  and  respectively 
the operating expense decline reflected reductions in the workforce  decreased marketing costs and cost savings achieved through the consolidation of us research and development efforts  offset by cdc and itk operating expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses declined in due to workforce reductions and cost saving initiatives  offset by increased intangible asset amortization 
the million of net restructuring charges recorded in fiscal were associated with the board approved plan to reorganize the sales and marketing functions in germany  england and the united states  by consolidating worldwide sales and marketing resources into strategic locations 
the charges item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating expenses continued consist principally of existing commitments for rent on facilities vacated by the company and termination payments associated with the elimination of positions 
these activities are expected to be completed by december the company anticipates annual cost savings of million from these restructurings 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the  restructuring charge recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter was associated with a board approved plan to consolidate existing offices in germany with those acquired from itk 
the charge consists principally of rent  contractual payments on office equipment  write offs of leasehold improvements and termination costs associated with the elimination of six positions 
activities were completed by june  after change in estimate adjustments of  the net charge of  is anticipated to yield annual cost savings of  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the  restructuring charge recorded in the fiscal second quarter was related to a board approved plan to consolidate operations and reduce costs and expenses 
the restructuring charge consisted of  in net cash expenditures primarily employee termination costs  all of which had been paid as of september   and  resulting from the write down of asset carrying values 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
other developments on december   the company announced that it expects revenue for the fiscal first quarter ending december  to be in a range of million to million and earnings per diluted share to be in a range of to 
the company attributes the lower than expected revenues and earnings for the first quarter primarily to two factors associated with year concerns 
sales to the company s oem customers have been affected by a temporary change in the purchasing patterns of end users until after january sales into the company s distribution channel have been impacted similarly by end user purchasing behavior and also more significantly by inventory reductions as channel participants reduce levels due to year concerns 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development acquisition of itk international  inc 
in july  the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of itk 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including estimated restructuring and integration costs of  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the company s acquisition  itk described itself as a remote access server ras product company 
although itk did offer its own line of isdn cards and networking boards  the company s acquisition was made principally to acquire the voice over internet protocol voip technology under development by itk 
this voip technology  if successfully developed  would allow users to send packetized voice signals through the internet 
the company believes that the voip technology under development at the time of the acquisition could provide for the development of products which would be a natural extension of the company s current product offerings and could position the company to address substantially larger markets than the markets served by the company s current products 
at the time of the acquisition  itk had developed a proof of concept prototype product netblazer which demonstrated that the method of voice and data compression under development by itk and the method of combining voip and remote access functionality under development by itk had the potential to be further developed into a product marketable to carrier class telephone companies 
however  the netblazer required further development before it could meet the technical and functional requirements of such customers 
accordingly  the company is uncertain whether the voip technology being developed will ultimately meet the technical requirements of carrier class telephony customers or whether it will be commercially viable 
as of the date of the acquisition  the nature of the development efforts related to the purchased  in process research and development projects  as well as the efforts required to complete development of those projects into commercially viable products  included development projects to address the following a development of enhanced technical attributes  including enhanced port density  redundancy  network management capabilities  a higher fault tolerance  compliance with telephone industry standards such as ss and nebs compliancy  b development of significant hardware and software functions considered integral to a product with broad appeal to end users and the telephone companies  including computer to phone capabilities  interoperability with other vendor s gateways  one stage dialing  local tone simulation and announcements  end to end transparent disconnect cause delivery and real time fax over capabilities  among others  and c re engineering of the prototype design to permit cost effective manufacture and commercial use  including migration from a unix operating system to a windows nt operating system 
it is not certain that development efforts on these projects will allow for carrier class telephone company and end user specifications to be met 
failure to achieve these specifications or to achieve market viability will cause the voip projects to fail 
if these products are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other identifiable intangible assets and goodwill acquired may become impaired 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued acquisition of itk international  inc 
continued management estimates that million of the purchase price represents the fair value of purchased in process research and development related to the voip projects referred to above  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
these amounts were expensed as a non recurring  non tax deductible charge upon consummation of the acquisition 
the company utilized the alternative income valuation approach to determine the estimated fair value of the purchased in process research and development 
this estimate is based on the following assumptions o the estimated revenues are based upon projected average annual revenue growth rates from future products expected to be derived once technological feasibility is achieved of between and during the period from through  starting with an estimated growth rate of from to with steadily declining rates of estimated revenue growth through estimated total revenues expected from products to be developed using purchased in process research and development peak in the year and decline rapidly in and as other new products are expected to enter the market 
these projections are based on estimates made by the company s management of market size and growth which are supported by independent market data  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by itk and its competitors 
o the estimated costs of sales are based upon the historical  stand alone costs of itk without considering any synergies due to the acquisition by the company 
o the estimated selling  general and administrative expenses of between and of revenues from through and between and of revenues between and  are based upon the estimated expense levels of itk as derived from the historical  stand alone costs of itk without considering any synergies due to the acquisition by the company 
o the discount rate utilized in the alternative income valuation approach is based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on various required rates of return from investments in various areas of that enterprise 
the wacc estimated by an independent third party appraiser for the company  as a corporate business enterprise is 
the discount rate used in the alternative valuation approach was 
this discount rate is higher than the wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates described above including uncertainty surrounding the successful development of purchased research and development  the estimated useful life of such completed research and development  the profitability levels of such completed research and development and the uncertainty of technological advances that are unknown at this time 
the company estimated that the purchased in process research and development related to voip was complete as of the acquisition date 
this estimate was based upon research and development costs item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued acquisition of itk international  inc 
continued incurred to date compared to total estimated development costs 
as of the date of acquisition  the estimated cost to complete the voip to a point of technological feasibility was approximately million  expected to be incurred over a period of approximately months following the acquisition 
this estimate is subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
the identifiable intangible assets of  included in the purchase price allocation set forth above are comprised of proven technology with an estimated fair value of  and an assembled workforce with an estimated fair value of  which have estimated useful lives of five years and six years  respectively 
the remaining unallocated purchase price represents goodwill of  which is being amortized over seven years 
with regard to the proven technology  the company intends to further enhance the strengths of this product range and implement a plan to gain leadership in the isdn market 
the company s core asset is the comprehensive set of common application programming interface capi and capi enhancing features combined with highly intelligent isdn protocol implementation which provide for integration into server based communication solutions for the media communication market 
the company is continuing development of the acquired in process voip technology and  as of september   believes that its development efforts are on schedule to meet the product release schedule referred to above with potential increases in its research and development costs 
however  these expectations are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process and changes in market expectations 
development costs incurred were million during the year ended september  the current version of the netblazer  which includes a sub set of the ultimate feature set  provided revenues of million during fiscal acquisition of central data corporation in july  the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of cdc 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including estimated restructuring and integration costs of  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
although cdc did offer its own line of traditional serial port connectivity products  the company s acquisition was made principally to acquire the universal serial bus usb technology under development by cdc 
this usb technology  if successfully developed  would broaden the company s product offerings to include this new  emerging industry standard port technology 
management considers such a product offering integral to its future market share because the marketplace is migrating from the traditional serial i o input output technology in which the company has significant market share to usb technology 
the company also believes that it can reduce its time to market by to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued acquisition of central data corporation continued months by acquiring cdc s in process research and development rather than initiating development of its own usb technology 
at the time of acquisition  cdc had developed a prototype of both the port and port usb connectivity technologies that demonstrated the validity of cdc s product development plan 
however  the usb technology development was still in process  and required significant development work and field testing before it could meet the technical and functional requirements of customers and achieve commercial viability 
accordingly  the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed could ultimately meet the technical and economic requirements of the marketplace and become commercially viable 
as of the date of the acquisition  the nature of the development efforts related to the purchased  in process research and development projects  as well as the efforts required to complete development of those projects into commercially viable products included a development of new hardware designs and software engineering relating to a complete reengineering of the in process usb technology  b development of new hardware designs for port usb products  and c development of a new hub architecture to support the cdc usb technology 
it is not certain that development efforts on these projects will allow for user specifications to be met or commercial viability to be achieved 
failure to achieve these specifications or to achieve market viability will cause the usb projects to fail 
if these products are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other identifiable intangible assets and goodwill acquired may become impaired

the company estimated that the purchased in process research and development related to usb was complete as of the acquisition date 
this estimate was based upon research and development costs incurred to date compared to total estimated development costs 
as of the date of acquisition  the estimated cost to complete the usb technology to a point of technological feasibility was approximately  expected to be incurred over a period of approximately nine months following the acquisition 
this estimate is subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
the identifiable intangible assets of  included in the purchase price allocation set forth above are comprised of proven technology with an estimated fair value of  and an assembled workforce with an estimated fair value of  which have estimated useful lives of five years and six years  respectively 
the remaining unallocated purchase price represents goodwill in the amount of  which is being amortized over seven years 
the company has developed the acquired in process usb research and development and released usb products  with initial product revenues generated during november included in revenues for fiscal is approximately  of revenues from the first release of certain usb products 
actual revenues are below original projections due to delays in the release and marketing of certain usb products 
research and development expenditures incurred to advance the acquired in process usb technology were  for fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other expense income other expense of  in consisted of  of interest expense on lines of credit and long term debt   of interest income on short term investments  and  of miscellaneous other expense 
other income for included primarily interest income on cash equivalents and a fiscal third quarter reversal of a million previously accrued obligation related to lease guarantees for aetherworks corporation 
as discussed in the next item below  the obligation is no longer required because the company is no longer the primary guarantor for these leases 
aetherworks corporation net loss and write off in connection with the company s previously purchased million of convertible notes from aetherworks corporation  in may the company exchanged such notes for a non interest bearing million non convertible note and was released from all of its guarantees of certain lease obligations of aetherworks 
due to significant uncertainty as to its collectibility  the million note  which matures in  has been recorded by the company as having no carrying value 
in fiscal the company used the equity method to account for its investment in aetherworks and record a net loss of million  which represented of aetherworks loss for the year 
the percentage of aetherworks net losses included in the company s financial statements was based upon the percentage of financial support provided by the company versus other investors during the company wrote off its investment in aetherworks as of september   and recorded a million charge  composed of its million remaining investment  its million remaining obligation to purchase additional notes and million for the obligation to guarantee certain aetherworks leases 
the company no longer has any funding obligations or any potential equity interest in or management control over aetherworks 
consequently  the company has not included any of aetherworks net losses in its results of operations during fiscal and fiscal income taxes the company recorded a million tax provision for and million tax provision for these tax provision amounts were required primarily because of the write off of acquired in process research and development and because the amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the purchase of itk and cdc is not deductible for income tax reporting purposes 
in  the company recorded a million tax provision  while reporting a pre tax loss for that year 
that provision was necessary due to the non deductibility of certain intangible assets written off as part of the restructuring charge  the aetherworks net losses and the related investment write off 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflation the company believes inflation has not had a material effect on its operations or its financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations principally with funds generated from operations  and  in prior years  with proceeds from earlier public offerings 
the company s working capital increased from million at september   to million at september  the company maintains lines of credit with various financial institutions providing for borrowings of up to million  depending upon levels of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
as of september   million had been borrowed under these line of credit agreements 
during  the company increased cash balances by approximately million  through cash flow from operations  principally due to an increase in cash generated from operations 
investing activities consisted of net investments of in marketable securities and purchases of million of equipment  capital improvements  and expansion of the company s enterprise wide enterprise resource planning erp software system into locations outside of the minnetonka headquarters 
financing activities consisted of payments on line of credit and debt obligations totaling million and  for repurchase of shares of the company s common stock  which was offset by million received from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
in september  the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to one million shares of the company s common stock for use in the company s benefit plans 
as of september    shares had been repurchased under this program at a weighted average price of 
the company s management believes that current financial resources  cash generated from operations and the company s potential capacity for debt and or equity financing will be sufficient to fund current and future business operations 
foreign currency translation effective january   eleven countries of the european union converted to a common currency called the euro 
this action will cause some of the company s european transactions to be negotiated  invoiced  and paid in euros 
the conversion will most likely add currency exchange costs and risks  although such costs and risks are not quantifiable at this time 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued foreign currency translation continued during  the company had approximately million of net sales related to foreign customers  of which million was in us dollars and was in deutschemark denominated sales 
during fiscal the average monthly exchange rate for the deutschemark to the us dollar dropped by approximately from 
to 
us dollars to the deutschemark  respectively 
in future periods  a significant portion of sales will be made in deutschemarks until full integration of the euro is achieved 
the company has not implemented a hedging strategy to reduce the risk of foreign currency translation exposures 
year readiness disclosure this section contains certain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company s year readiness  and the effects of the year on the company may be differ materially from currently projected 
this may be due to  among other things  delays in the implementation of the company s year plan  which includes contingency plans  and the failure of key third parties with whom the company transacts business to achieve year compliance 
the company faces risk to the extent that suppliers of products and services purchased by the company and others with whom the company transacts business on a world wide basis do not have business products and services that comply with year requirements 
the company has obtained assurances from most of its key suppliers that their products and services are year compliant 
in the event any such third parties cannot  in a timely manner  provide the company with products and services that meet the year requirements  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company began a comprehensive project in to prepare its products and its enterprise wide information management system and other internal computer systems for the year the company believes its implementation of a new enterprise wide information management system  principally installed to improve operating efficiency  will address the company s internal year compliance issues 
the worldwide rollout of this system was completed on september  most of the company s products are year compliant because there is very little or no date processing involved 
certain products  including end of life versions  do require customer action such as a patch or version upgrade to be compliant 
these products have been identified  and the company has notified impacted customers 
overall  management believes the year will not have a significant impact on operations 
the company plans to continue with remediation and testing efforts with both its products and internal systems to further mitigate any risks associated with the year contingency plans have been established in order to transact business at sufficient levels in the case of adverse events related to the year date change 
in addition  the company will monitor the enterprise computer systems  lan wan  and the computer room environments for temperature  continuous power supply  and transaction integrity 
facility personnel will be monitoring owned and leased buildings for heating and security 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year readiness disclosure continued the costs associated with the year project have been minimal and are not incremental to the company  but include temporary reallocation of existing resources 
however  there can be no assurances that various factors relating to the year compliance issues  including litigation  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  or financial position 
while the company believes it is prepared for year issues and has an effective program in place to resolve the impact of a year issue in a timely manner  there can be no assurance that the failure of the company or of the third parties with whom the company transacts business to adequately address their respective year issues  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations
