the decline in sales of core products reflected various internal and external factors 
home care product sales  mainly the b f line  were negatively impacted due to shipping delays caused by the closure and consolidation of the company s toledo facility into st 
louis 
as previously discussed  this facility was closed during the second quarter of fiscal and consolidated into st 
louis 
the company continues its efforts to improve manufacturing efficiencies and realize cost savings on the b f product line through selective outsourcing of labor intensive assembly operations 
as discussed earlier management believes that  in the longer term  these efforts will lower manufacturing costs and increase the level of incoming business through improved customer service 
the company also experienced certain production and supply chain problems at its st 
louis facility that caused delays in delivery times on various products 
most of these production problems and supply chain issues have now been resolved 
in addition  the company has continued its efforts to increase margins on certain distributed products and oem business by selecting markets and or customers that will support more favorable pricing on these products 
certain external issues have continued to impact the company s operations  both in fiscal and fiscal the emphasis on cost containment by healthcare providers has resulted in significant consolidation in the healthcare environment and pricing pressures for the past several years 
home care sales have also been adversely affected by reductions in medicare reimbursements 
while the company is unable to predict when these macro economic issues will be resolved  management believes that over a long term horizon  allied is well positioned to capitalize on the demands for its products caused by an aging population  an increase in the occurrence of lung disease  advances in treatment of other respiratory illnesses in the home  hospital  and sub acute care facilities and upgrading of medical treatment around the world 
medical gas equipment sales of million in fiscal were million  or  below prior year sales of million

medical gas construction product sales are affected by large bid orders on new hospital construction and renovation of medical facilities 
hospital consolidation has caused a decrease in large bid orders for these products 
respiratory care product sales in fiscal of million were million  or  less than sales of million in the prior year 
of the decline  million was attributable to revenues generated by the ventilation products division prior to its sale in october and million relates to the company s base respiratory product lines 
sales to the home healthcare market declined by  primarily in the b f disposable line  due to the factors discussed above 
in addition  pricing pressures caused by the consolidation of home healthcare dealers and continued concern over potential reductions in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates continued to impact sales of home healthcare products 
also contributing to the decrease in respiratory care products is the loss of air compressor oem business to bear medical following its divestiture 
emergency medical product sales in fiscal of million were million  or  less than fiscal sales of million 
a decrease in oem sales of certain emergency products contributed to most of the decrease 
business in this market is largely replacement driven and is expected to reflect the demand for replacement orders in the short term 
international sales  which are included in the product lines discussed above decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal international sales declined million due to the sale of the ventilation products division  headwall products sales decreased million  while international sales of the base business decreased by million

advances in medical protocol in various countries throughout the world combined with the company s strong international dealer network have enabled the company to respond to increased worldwide demand for medical products 
export sales are affected by international economic conditions and the relative value of foreign currencies

louis impacted gross margins in fiscal the company is continuing its efforts in gaining efficiency in the manufacturing of b f products in st 
louis and is also outsourcing the assembly of certain products as previously discussed 
the sale of the ventilation products division adversely impacted gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal  as ventilation products typically have a higher gross profit margin than the company s base business products

seasonality and quarterly results in past fiscal years  the company has experienced seasonal increases in net sales during its second and third fiscal quarter october through march which  in turn  affected net income

while these patterns have an impact on the company s quarterly operations  the company is unable to predict the extent of this impact in any particular period

year the company utilizes software and related computer technologies essential to its operations 
the company has established a plan  utilizing internal resources  to assess the potential impact of the changeover to the year on the company s systems and operations and to implement solutions to address this issue 
in october  the company converted its corporate offices and its manufacturing operation to a new fully integrated software system 
the date methodology of this software is not sensitive to year problems 
however  the company is in the process of implementing testing procedures to insure year readiness 
system modifications or reprogramming have been minor in nature 
the company has also analyzed other internal computerized processes  including  but not limited to  manufacturing  engineering  personal computer network  and other facility management systems for potential year issues 
systems identified as being impacted by the changeover to the year are being modified or replaced 
the company estimates that the year conversion effort is over complete and expects all critical systems will be year compliant by november the company has not separately distinguished between costs incurred specifically to assure year compliance and normal expenditures needed to maintain or upgrade existing systems to current technology levels 
the company believes that any such costs expended were not material 
the company does not expect to incur any significant costs on the remaining year compliance efforts 
the company is dependent on various third parties to conduct its business operations 
these third parties are customers and vendors of raw material and components used in the production process 
the company s revenues are not dependent upon any single or any few number of customers 
the company employs a large number of vendors  without concentration of critical vendors 
the company believes that vendors could be replaced if they fail to meet the company s demand for components 
none of the company s products or components of company products use date sensitive technology 
therefore  the company believes that third party risk involving the changeover to year is relatively small 
however  while reasonable actions are being taken to mitigate the risk of unanticipated costs and or business interruptions due to year problems in its internal systems  or those of its vendors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience any costs and or disruptions from any other external year failures 
the magnitude of any such costs and or disruptions and the possible impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  is unpredictable 
in addition  while efforts to date have focused on mitigating year problems  the company plans to evaluate the reasonable potential risks to determine the extent of contingency planning and resources that are appropriate
