it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the corporation is the parent to its wholly owned subsidiary  first federal savings bank of elizabethtown the bank 
all dollar amounts except per share data are presented in thousands unless otherwise noted 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance

acquisition on july   the bank completed its acquisition of three bank branches located in meade county  kentucky from bank one corporation 
two of the banking centers are located in brandenburg  kentucky and the third banking center is in flaherty  kentucky 
in the transaction  the bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the acquisition of the meade county banking centers 
the transaction resulted in recording of approximately  of loans and  of deposits 
the net deposits assumed exceeded the cash received by  any ratios or analysis comparing years before acquisition will not be comparable 
branch expansion on april   the bank opened a new banking center within the hillview wal mart supercenter 
the cost of construction for the square feet was approximately this new banking center is open hours per week and adds extended hours for our new and existing customers 
in addition  our associates are allowed to utilize the wal mart s customers to create new sales opportunities

also  the corporation incurred data and computer conversion costs of  net of tax relating to its conversion to a new data processor 
in addition to these expenses  amortization of intangibles increased to  net of tax in from  net of tax in excluding these acquisition and conversion costs and amortization of intangibles  net earnings for the period would have increased approximately to  or per share diluted for the fiscal year ended june  from  or per share diluted for the fiscal year ending june  including acquisition and excluding acquisition and conversion costs and conversion costs and amortization of amortization of intangibles intangibles net income     diluted earnings per share net interest income net interest income increased by  during to  as compared to  in in spite of the declining net interest margin 
the bank s net interest margin declined to for the year ended june  compared to for the period

the acquisition contributed approximately million to the total deposit growth 
the cost of funds on these deposits averaged during which was a decrease of basis points from the average cost of funds of 
this decrease is attributable to lower rates paid on short term customer deposits 
provision for loan losses management periodically evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the bank s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay and other factors 
the provision for loan losses was for net charge offs were during as compared to during the bank s allowance for loan losses was million or

allowance for loan losses to non performing loans allowance for loan losses to net loans 


non performing assets to total assets 


non interest income and expense non interest income was  in  an increase of  or over the growth in deposits resulting from the acquisition was the largest contributing factor to the increase in other income 
fee income in connection with loans originated for the secondary market increased by or during the fiscal year due to a better market penetration  as opposed to higher refinancing activity 
fee income from trust  brokerage and other services also increased due to growth in deposit relationships with existing customers 
through a subsidiary of the bank  gains on sales of real estate held for development of were reported due to the sale of commercial lots in an office park currently under development 
non interest expense excluding the one time acquisition related charges and information technology upgrades increased by million or during as compared to the largest contributing factor to higher expenses was the operating costs of the three acquired branches coupled with a amortization charge on the intangible assets associated with the acquisition 
other contributing factors are expenses resulting from higher loan originations and the opening of a new banking center located in the wal mart supercenter in hillview  kentucky 
compensation and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  increased by or in compared to the increase includes salary increases and reflects increases in the number of full time equivalent employees from at june   to at june   due to acquisitions and expansion of the bank s business activity 
occupancy and equipment expense increased by or in as compared to primarily due to the expansion in the number of banking locations from at june   to at june  marketing and advertising expense increased by or in compared to due to the increase in marketing activities associated with the expansion in the number of banking centers and the development of new products and services 
all other non interest expenses increased by  or in compared to this increase includes the acquisition of the meade county banking centers and their respective operating expenses 
the increase is also a result of asset growth  new services provided by the bank and general inflation 
liquidity and capital resources the bank is required to maintain levels of liquid assets as defined by the office of thrift supervision regulations 
this requirement is based on a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings and is currently 
the bank s liquidity ratio was at june  the bank s primary source of funds for meeting its liquidity needs are customer deposits  borrowings from the federal home loan bank  principal and interest payments from loans and mortgage backed securities  and earnings from operations retained by the bank 
loan demand continued to be strong during the fiscal year ended june   as net loans increased from million at june   to million at june  the acquisition of the meade county banking centers contributed million to the total loan growth of million  while the bank achieved a growth rate in its existing loan customer base  or million in net new loans 
the meade county acquisition also contributed million in new customer deposits 
the acquisition coupled with a million growth in the bank s customer deposits resulted in a total deposit increase of million during the fiscal year ended june  the bank intends to continue to fund loan growth outstanding loan commitments were million at june  and any declines in customer deposits through additional advances from the fhlb

the office of thrift supervision s capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three capital standards a tier i leverage ratio  a tier i capital ratio  and an risk based capital standard 
as of june   the bank s actual capital percentages for tier i leverage of  tier i capital of  and current risk based capital of  significantly exceed the regulatory requirement for each category 
impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the bank has an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on the bank s loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
regulatory matters the bank insures its customers deposits through the savings association insurance fund saif 
on september   federal deposit insurance corporation fdic legislation was signed into law to recapitalize the saif 
as was anticipated  all saif insured savings institutions were required to pay a one time special assessment of 
for every of customer deposits 
this resulted in a charge to earnings of  net of tax  during the first quarter of on january   the bank began paying insurance premiums of 
per of deposits as compared to a previous premium of 
per of deposits 
year as always  you can be proud of the banking industry  which has been consistently rated by experts as one of the foremost industries in addressing the year date change 
what is the year problem simply put  the year problem is a result of cost cutting effort 
the computer programmers in the s and s used a year s last two digits instead of the whole four digit to identify dates 
memory was a premium commodity in computer programming at that time and programmers could save space by deleting the first two digits of a year 
the concern now is that date sensitive automated systems could malfunction or stop functioning completely come january  because they would read as the year instead of status first federal savings bank s board of directors and senior management is committed to be year ready 
therefore  management created a year team in april to study the issue and to guide the bank through the year process 
the first steps involved an evaluation of the effects year could have on our information systems and other important aspects of our business 
a formal year plan was then established and filed with the bank s federal regulators  the office of thrift supervision 
the plan is continuously updated with the primary focus on achieving compliance within established time frames 
the bank s plan has five phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
all phases of the bank s year plan were substantially completed as of june  efforts for the remaining portion of the year will be customer awareness  liquidity needs and contingency planning 
first federal savings bank has developed a business resumption or contingency plan  which the bank will implement in the event certain critical systems failed despite affirmative representations from vendors and favorable test results 
these plans will be updated regularly and should enable the bank to function at a level sufficient to serve the majority of our customer s needs until any year problems are resolved 
the plan will be validated in the fall of cost capital outlays for becoming year compliant through june  totaled  net of tax all of which was expensed as incurred 
as the bank s initiatives are substantially complete  management anticipates future costs to be minimal and expensed as incurred 
risk first federal savings bank relies upon numerous third party vendors and infrastructures to provide complete service to our customers  and failure on their part to not become year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the bank 
monitoring of the mission critical vendors will continue through the remaining half of the calendar year 
comparison of fiscal to net income for the fiscal year ended june   was  or per share diluted as compared to net income of  or per share diluted for the same period in during the quarter ended september   net income was affected by a one time special assessment of million million  net of tax paid to the fdic to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund saif 
net earnings for the period would have been approximately million or per share diluted had it not been for the special assessment 
see further discussion under regulatory matters 
in addition to the higher net income  the increase in net income per share was also attributable to the corporation s stock repurchase plans which have reduced the weighted average number of shares outstanding from  for the period to  for total interest income increased by  from fiscal to due to the strong growth of the bank s loan portfolio 
interest income on loans accounts for the majority of the bank s interest income as average loan balances  which comprise of the total interest earning assets  were million during as compared to million during  or an increase of million 
the average yield on loans increased by basis points to during as compared to during total interest expense increased by  from fiscal to the weighted average interest rate paid on customer deposits averaged during  which was an increase of basis points from the average cost of funds of 
the increase was attributable to higher rates paid on short term customer deposits 
customer deposit balances averaged million during  a million increase from the average balance of million 
interest expense paid on deposits increased by  while interest expense paid on federal home loan bank advances increased by as a result of the foregoing discussion  net interest income increased by to  in form  in management periodically evaluates the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses based on the bank s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may effect the borrower s ability to repay and other factors

item a 
disclosures about market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  the bank manages its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability committee aloc 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies of the corporation  which include managing the sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
a primary purpose of the corporation s alco is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the corporation s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the corporation s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the corporation s change in npv in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates and interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
the table  presented on page  under item regulatory capital requirements  presents the corporation s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels as of june  all market risk sensitive instruments presented in this table are held to maturity or available for sale 
the corporation has no trading securities 
npv is calculated by the corporation pursuant to guidelines estimated by the ots 
the calculation is based on the net present value of estimated discounted cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker quotations and other public sources as of june   with adjustments made to reflect the shift in the treasury yield curve as appropriate 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposits decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv 
actual values may differ from those projections presented  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the npv 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  which represent one of the corporation s primary loan products  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans in the corporation s portfolio could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to refinance activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the npv 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate mortgage loans may decrease in the event of interest rate increases 
another tool of evaluating the institution s sensitivity to net interest income to changes in interest rates is to examine the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
the following interest rate sensitivity table sets forth the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at june   which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis as of june  dollars in thousands over months months years years total interest earning assets loans      securities      total rate sensitive assets      interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings      time deposits      borrowed funds    total rate sensitive liabilities      interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets as the preceding table indicates  the bank has a moderate negative cumulative gap for assets and liabilities maturing or repricing within one year in the amount of  million or of total assets 
thus  decreases in interest rates during this time period would generally increase net interest income  while increases in interest rates would generally decrease net interest income 
however  even though the periodic gap analysis provides management with a method of measuring current interest rate risk  it only measures rate sensitivity at a specific point in time 
gap analysis does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree and  therefore  does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income 
additionally  certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and decay rates may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to afford the payments on their adjustable rate mortgage loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase
