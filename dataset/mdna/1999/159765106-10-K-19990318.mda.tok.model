item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview from its inception in june through june   the company was a development stage enterprise that devoted its resources to funding research and development of colorless moissanite gemstones  market research  developing initial consumer marketing themes and assembling a management team 
the company s principal business is the manufacture  marketing and distribution of moissanite gemstones 
moissanite is being marketed as an exclusive new gemstone with properties  including brilliance  fire and hardness that rival other fine gemstones like diamond  sapphire  ruby and emerald 
the company began shipping moissanite to authorized retail jewelers in atlanta and miami ft 
lauderdale during the second quarter of  and  in july  launched consumer focused advertising and promotion activities in those areas 
during the third and fourth quarters of the company expanded the number of authorized retail jewelers primarily located in the southeastern states of north carolina  south carolina  georgia and florida and increased the number of exclusive international distributors 
marketing and promotion activities were focused primarily in these southeastern states 
domestically  during  the company will focus on the market introduction of moissanite in other areas of the united states 
international efforts during the first half of will be focused primarily on managing existing relationships with the last half of being focused on efforts to expand the international distribution of moissanite 
the company believes that its sales volumes will increase as the yield of salable gemstones from each crystal provided by cree increases  additional crystal growth capacity is added  and as the market introduction of moissanite gemstones expands geographically 
as distribution of moissanite expands  the company will incur increasing spending levels as it continues to make investments in development efforts with cree to increase production volumes and yields  as it makes investments in receivables  inventory and manufacturing equipment  and as it increases advertising  marketing and personnel expenditures 
the company expects to continue operating at a loss through at least part of moreover  there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve the expected sales increases or profitability or that if profitability is achieved  that such profitability can be sustained 
see business risks limited relevant operating history 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   were  the company generated net sales of approximately  from moissanite and approximately  from the company s proprietary test instrument 
in addition  during the first six months of prior to emerging from the development stage  the company generated net sales of approximately  for gemstones  which have been netted against research and development expenses on the operating statement because many of the gemstones were associated with the company s research and development program 
there were no sales for the year ended december  gross profit was  or of net sales for the year ended december  during  gross margins on sales of the company s test instrument were higher than the gross margins on sales of moissanite 
the company will seek to increase gross margins for moissanite gemstones as the company realizes improved yields from each sic crystal produced by cree 
gross margins for test instruments will likely decrease over time as the company enters into additional volume distribution agreements and if it experiences pricing pressures on its testers from competitive test instruments 
marketing and sales expenses increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to development and execution of consumer focused advertising and marketing expenses associated with the initial launch of moissanite  increased market research and compensation and travel expenses associated with the expansion of the company s sales staff 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from an approximate  decrease in compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options 
stock option compensation expense aggregated approximately  in compared to approximately  in this decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately  resulting from compensation and other expenses related to additional staff  occupancy expenses  investor relations and legal expenses associated with business expansion and additional sec compliance obligations incurred as a public company 
research and development expenses increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  approximately  of the increase was attributable to development expenses incurred under the company s june development agreement  january supplemental development agreement and july amended and restated development agreement with cree research  inc the july agreement replaces the two previous development agreements between c and cree and provides both parties increased flexibility to pursue further color and yield improvements on both inch and inch diameter crystals 
in addition  a portion of the increase resulted from net production costs for moissanite gemstones during the first half of while the company was in the development stage 
the remaining increase was due to increased expenditures for the company s internal development of prototype gemstone pre forming and faceting operations and compensation expense for company research and development staff 
net interest income increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher interest income earned on higher cash balances due primarily to the investment of proceeds from the company s initial public offering in november year ended december  compared with year ended december  marketing and sales expenses increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to the compensation expense of additional sales staff hired since the prior period  increased market research expenditures and the development of preliminary advertising and marketing materials 
prior to may   the company had no paid employees 
general and administrative expenses increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  of this increase  approximately  represented compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options to employees and directors of the company and an additional  represented compensation expense related to the exercise of cree s option to acquire  shares common stock on january  the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the compensation expense of additional staff hired since the prior period and occupancy expenses 
the company had no paid employees before may  prior to february   the company conducted its operations from the home of two of its founders and did not incur any lease or rent expenses during that time 
research and development expenses increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to expanded colorless sic crystal development efforts at cree  internal development of prototype gemstone pre forming and faceting operations  qualifying of vendors for production and development of production quality prototypes of the moissanite diamond test instrument 
net interest income increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase generally reflected interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  consisting primarily of us treasury bills and us treasury money market funds acquired by investing the proceeds from the company s initial public offering of common stock in november and its series b preferred stock offering in january  february and march liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations since inception primarily through the net proceeds of its initial public offering of common stock in november and  prior to such offering  through private equity sales 
net proceeds from the company s initial public offering were  in the company used  to fund operations and  to fund capital expenditures and patent expenses 
at december   the company had  of cash and cash equivalents and  of working capital 
in addition to the use of all of the crystal growth systems that cree is required to provide at its expense under the exclusive supply agreement  during the company ordered a quantity of crystals that required additional crystal growth systems to be added 
as permitted under the exclusive supply agreement  cree elected to have c purchase those systems 
during the company paid approximately million to cree for these systems which were placed in operation at various dates from august through december 
the company is obligated to purchase all of the output of these growth systems through june  the company routinely evaluates cree s progress under the development agreement and the size and quality of sic crystals being produced by cree in assessing its plans for larger orders which will require the acquisition of additional crystal growth systems 
under the terms of the exclusive supply agreement  cree has the option  in its sole discretion  of building the growth systems at its own cost or requiring the company to purchase the growth systems from cree 
the company intends to order quantities of sic crystals in amounts that would require the purchase of additional growth systems as  on average  net yields of salable gemstones improve 
see business manufacturing growth of sic crystals 
the company plans to engage in increasingly substantial marketing activities to support the expanding distribution of moissanite gemstones 
such activities may include advertising campaigns  cooperative advertising with retail jewelers and distributors  point of purchase displays  educational materials and individualized jeweler training 
the year development agreement between the company and cree requires the company to fund a development program at cree for million annually through june  either party may terminate the agreement if cree does not meet the annual performance milestone or if the company and cree do not mutually agree on the performance milestones for the ensuing year 
see business products and product development amended and restated development agreement with cree 
the company has no committed external sources of capital 
based on its current operating plan  the company anticipates that its existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements for at least the remainder of there may be circumstances  however  particularly a delay in obtaining improvements in the yield of salable gemstones from each sic crystal or lower than anticipated sales  that might accelerate the use of the company s existing capital resources 
in those circumstances  the company may be required to raise substantial additional funds in the future  through public or private sources or other relationships 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available  or if available  that it will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
net operating loss carryforward as of december  the company had a net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately  which expires between and in accordance with section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  a change in equity ownership of greater than of the company within a three year period results in an annual limitation on the company s ability to utilize its nol carryforwards that were created during tax periods prior to the change in ownership 
as a result of various equity offerings and certain shareholder transactions  the utilization of the company s nol carryforwards has become limited  however  the company does not believe this limitation will have a material effect on the company s ability to utilize the nol carryforward 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
the inability to recognize or properly treat dates subsequent to december  may cause a company s systems and applications to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company has undertaken a program to address the year issue with respect to the following i the company s information technology and operating systems  and ii certain systems of the company s major suppliers  including cree insofar as such systems relate to the company s business activities with such parties 
as part of its evolution to an operating company  the company has selected and is in the process of implementing an enterprise wide information technology system to support the long term information needs of the company 
the company has received written confirmation from the software vendor that the information technology system selected by the company is fully year compliant 
the company anticipates that the implementation of this system and testing of the year compliance of the system will be completed by mid and that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the company is in the process of reviewing its non information technology systems for year compliance and expects this review to be complete by mid the company believes the year exposure with respect to those systems is not material 
the company has also initiated communications with its significant suppliers and vendors  including cree 
the company is coordinating efforts with these parties to minimize the extent to which the company s business will be vulnerable to their failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company has received confirmation from its significant suppliers and vendors that they have developed plans to address the year compliance issues of their systems prior to december  the crystal growth systems which cree uses to produce silicon carbide crystals for the company are dependent upon microprocessors 
cree has confirmed to the company that it has evaluated the crystal growth systems and determined that they are fully year compliant 
cree is also evaluating and remediating its other business systems which rely on microprocessors 
according to cree s form s dated february   cree expects to have completed all year compliance efforts by april to the extent that they are not remediated  year issues could cause delays in the receipt of silicon carbide crystals which would  in turn  delay deliveries of moissanite gemstones to the company s customers 
any significant delay in the company s receipt of sic crystals or resulting delay in delivery of moissanite gemstones would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties on which the company s business relies will be modified on a timely basis 
additionally  to the extent that the general economy slows down as a result of year compliance issues  the company s operations could be affected 
the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of its systems or those operated by other parties to operate properly beyond december  to the extent possible  the company will be developing and executing contingency plans designed to allow continued operation in the event of failure of the company s or third parties systems
