competition the company is a leading owner and operator of hotels in the united states 
competition in the united states lodging industry is generally based on convenience of location  price  range of services and guest amenities offered  plus the quality of customer service and overall product

at december   mainstay suites were open and operating with another seven hotels under construction 
the cost to develop a mainstay suites hotel approximates to million 
in order for the company to continue on a long term basis the mainstay suites development program  additional capital will be required 
subject to market conditions  the company anticipates raising additional debt capital during calendar year at the distribution date  the company owed choice million in the form of a pay in kind subordinated note with a five year maturity 
the note provides additional financial flexibility due to the fact that accrued interest is payable at maturity 
the company does  however  expect to refinance the choice note with a longer term and lower cost subordinated debt financing as soon as practicable 
at the distribution date  sunburst owed choice an additional approximately million relative to the final allocation of assets  liabilities and equity between the two parties 
this obligation was effectively satisfied with the execution in december of an amendment to the company s strategic alliance agreement  which  among other things  terminated the company s option to purchase the mainstay suites brand name

the proceeds were used to retire debt  including million of cmbs debt which resulted in a pre payment penalty of  after tax 
notwithstanding the real estate intensive nature of the company s business  the company s objective is to reduce its overall leverage while continuing to grow through development 
the company intends to continue to strategically dispose of hotels not meeting its criteria for long term retention and utilize the proceeds to retire debt and fund future development 
between december  and march   the company sold an additional hotel for million in cash and  at march   has an additional twelve hotels being marketed for sale 
at december   the company s debt to book capitalization amounted to  while debt to market capitalization was

planned capital expenditures for the construction of hotels in are projected to be approximately million 
sunburst may also pursue additional acquisitions of significantly under valued properties 
year many existing computer programs use two digits to identify a year 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if the programs are not corrected  computer applications could fail or create erroneous results at the turn of the century 
the company has developed a plan to address the impact of the year on its computer systems and other systems with embedded microprocessors that could be date sensitive collectively  in house systems  as well as issues related to third party vendors and suppliers of the company 
the company s plan consists of four phases assess computer systems and other systems with embedded microprocessors and determine which such systems are critical to the ongoing operations of the company  inventory critical systems to determine manufacturers  suppliers or vendors  test or assess the readiness of systems and vendors and suppliers  and  inventory and assess the readiness of non critical systems 
corrective actions are being taken as issues arise 
the following discusses the companies progress in addressing both in house systems and third party vendors 
the company s financial accounting and reporting systems are scheduled to be upgraded in early to a version that has been certified to be year compliant 
following the upgrade  the accounting and reporting systems are expected to adequately provide information and reporting needs into the next century 
non compliant computer hardware and software at the company s corporate headquarters and all its hotels has been identified and a schedule to upgrade affected systems by september has been established 
the company estimates that approximately of its employee workstations will need to be upgraded 
in order to accommodate a new property management system required by choice hotels international  inc  the company had previously planned to update these systems 
therefore  the cost of upgrading the systems  outside of previously planned upgrades  is estimated to be immaterial 
the company has inventoried systems with embedded chips used at the company s corporate headquarters as well as building systems at the company s hotel properties ie  elevators  room key systems  hvac equipment  as fire safety equipment and has begun contacting manufacturers to determine the readiness of the systems for the year any systems determined to be year sensitive and non compliant will be replaced or modified as necessary 
although the company does not have an estimate for the cost to bring all critical systems into compliance  it is not believed to be material 
the company is developing a contingency plan to address the possible failure of any in house systems 
as critical non compliant systems are identified that the company believes may not be compliant by the year  contingency plans will be created 
the company relies significantly on third party systems to provide various goods and services 
the company has identified those vendors and suppliers that it believes to be critical to the ongoing operations of the company and has begun contacting them to verify their state of readiness and evaluate their contingency plans 
based on the responses received  the company believes that the critical third party systems are or will be year compliant 
to the extent that a third party cannot certify that their systems will be year complaint  the company will take actions to correct the non compliant situation or develop contingency plans 
because the company relies significantly on choice hotels international  inc choice for reservation and property management systems as well as overall franchisee support  their state of readiness for year is critical to the company 
therefore  a description of choice plan to address the year issue  as set forth in its sec filings  follows 
choice s exposure to potential year problems exists in two general areas technological operations in the sole control of choice  and technological operations dependent in some way on one or more third parties 
with respect to internal systems  choice has conducted year compliance testing on all of its proprietary software  including its reservations and reservations support systems  its franchise support system and its franchisee property management support systems 
choice has indicated that the proprietary software is year compliant 
choice s year compliance committee is currently identifying third party vendors and service providers whose non compliant systems could have a material impact on choice and undertaking an assessment as to such parties compliant status 
these parties include franchisees  airline global distribution systems gds  utility providers  telephone service providers  banks and data processing services 
the gds companies  which provide databases through which travel agents can book hotel rooms  have assured choice in writing that they are making the necessary changes in their system to become compliant and choice has begun conducting tests with the gds companies 
additional information regarding choice s year preparedness can be obtained from their sec filings 
failure by the company or one or more of its third party vendors to adequately address the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company is not able to estimate the impact such failure could have due to its dependence on third parties including utility companies  airlines  hotel reservation centers  choice  banks and credit card payment processing centers 
in addition  the severity and duration of failures will greatly affect the impact of such failures on the company 
as a result of the considerable publicity surrounding  and the increased consumer awareness of  the year issue  it is possible that travel patterns may be disrupted 
the company is unable to estimate the effect such disruptions  if any  may have on its hotel operations 
seasonality demand at many of the hotels is affected by recurring seasonal patterns  depending upon the location of the hotel 
accordingly  the company s operations are seasonal in nature  with lower revenue and operating profit in november through february and higher revenue and operating profit in march through october 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the revenues or operating results of the company during calendar  the seven months ended december  or the three fiscal years ended may  forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis  as well as other parts of this annual report on form k  contain information based on management s beliefs and forward looking statements that involve a number of risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not materially differ from the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to the company s substantial leverage and its plan to realize cash proceeds through leveraging its remaining assets  its plans to make selected strategic investments and acquisitions and develop new hotels  its success in implementing its business strategy  including its success in arranging financing where required  competition  government regulation  and general economic and business conditions 
the company s intentions with respect to the development of mainstay suites and other new hotels is subject to the company s ability to access sufficient capital to continue such development  the acceptance of and demand for such products by the consumer and competition
