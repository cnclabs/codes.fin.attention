tlc owns and manages refractive centers which  together with tlc s network of over  optometrists and opthamologists  provide laser vision correction of common refractive disorders such as myopia nearsightednesss  hyperopia farsightedness and astigmatism 
laser vision correction is an outpatient procedure which  is designed to change the curvature of the cornea to reduce or eliminate a patient s reliance on eyeglasses or contact lenses 
tlc  which commenced operations in  currently has refractive centers in states and provinces throughout the united states and canada 
surgeons performed over  procedures at the company s centers during the fiscal year the company recognizes revenues at the time services are rendered 
net revenues include only those revenues pertaining to owned laser centers and management fees from managing refractive and secondary care practices 
under the terms of the practice management agreements  the company provides management  marketing and administrative services to refractive and secondary care practices in return for management fees 
management services revenue is equal to the net revenue of the physician practice  less amounts retained by the physician groups 
operating expenses include all fixed and variable expenses relating to the operation of the company s businesses 
the principal components of operating expenses are marketing costs  wages  surgeon s fees  laser royalty fee and facility leasing costs 
the company continues to pursue a growth strategy in its core refractive laser surgery business  which accounts for more than of net revenues 
it is expected that in addition to same store growth  new clinics are expected to be built or acquired during the year to increase procedure volume and position the company for continuing growth 
the company s continuing growth and future profitability are affected by the extent to which laser vision correction becomes more widely accepted in north american markets 
the company anticipates that the percentage of revenue derived from the core refractive business will continue to increase as the market for laser vision correction grows

results of operations year ended may  compared to year ended may  net revenues for the fiscal year were million  which is a increase over last year s million total 
more than of total net revenues were derived from refractive surgery as compared to in fiscal demonstrating the increasing significance of the company s core business 
this trend will continue because the company divested itself of a significant portion of its secondary care operation in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year net revenues from refractive centers for the fiscal year were million  which is higher than last year s million total 
more than  procedures were performed in fiscal compared to  procedures in fiscal industry estimates are that procedure growth for the entire industry will be approximately in calendar year over the previous year 
the increasing revenues reflects strong growth in the number of procedures at existing sites  the development of new centers and the acquisition of centers from competitors 
net revenues from secondary care centers increased to million from million in fiscal the acquisition of tlc michigan in february accounted for the revenue growth 
net revenues from this business segment will decrease reflecting the divestiture of certain secondary care practices in the fourth quarter of fiscal year operating expenses and doctor compensation increased to million in the fiscal year from million in fiscal this increase is a result of i increased variable expenses associated with the increase in the number of laser vision correction procedures performed at existing refractive centers  and ii increased fixed and variable costs from the addition of new refractive centers  and iii higher corporate costs which are necessary to support the higher level of business activity 
operating expenses and doctor compensation as a percentage of net revenues were of net revenues as compared to of net revenues in fiscal year this decrease is attributed to the higher average number of procedures being performed at almost all of centers 
interest expense and other expenses of million includes higher interest expenses on long term debt and capital leases on equipment that were held for the entire fiscal year which is largely a result of the beacon acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in fiscal the interest expense reflects only a part year of interest obligations as a significant portion of equipment was acquired during the fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in fiscal year this is a result of a full year s depreciation expense on centers during the fiscal year versus centers the previous year 
in addition amortization of intangibles increased from million in to million in fiscal resulting primarily from the full year amortization of the and beacon acquisition goodwill 
goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over fifteen years 
start up and development expenses are costs incurred to develop the eye care specialty managed care business 
during fiscal start up and development costs were incurred by partner provider health pph for the development of the managed care business 
tlc sold pph in may of the company does not expect to incur these costs in the future 
tlc the laser center inc 
restructuring charges of million were incurred to reflect the disposal of tlc northwest eye  which was tlc s largest secondary care operation 
tlc continues to own an interest in the fixed assets of tlc northwest eye and expects to earn a small management fee for the use of those assets 
the sale of pph resulted in an additional charge of million  resulting in total restructuring charges of million 
these dispositions reflect the increasing focus by tlc management on the core refractive business 
income tax expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease is a result of existing canadian centers being amalgamated with former canadian beacon centers and the ability to apply the profits from these existing centers against loss carry forwards from beacon centers 
the net income before restructuring charge for fiscal was million or per share  compared to a loss of million or cents a share the previous year 
this net income is a result of the much higher procedure volume in the refractive business 
after restructuring charges the loss was million or cents a share

more than of total net revenues were derived from refractive surgery as compared to in fiscal demonstrating the increasing significance of the company s core business

net revenues from secondary care centers increased to million from million in fiscal slightly higher revenues from tlc northwest eye inc and the acquisition of tlc michigan in february accounted for the revenue growth 
operating expenses and doctor compensation increased to million in the fiscal year from million in fiscal this increase is a result of i increased variable expenses associated with the increase in the number of laser vision correction procedures performed at existing refractive centers  and ii increased fixed and variable costs from the addition of new refractive centers 
operating expenses and doctor compensation as a percentage of net revenues was of net revenues as compared to of net revenues in fiscal year this reduction reflects the impact of having reached contribution margin levels which exceed the fixed costs at most of its refractive centers 
interest expense and other of million includes higher interest expenses on long term debt and capital leases which was offset by higher interest income and foreign exchange gains

depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in fiscal year this is a result of a full year s depreciation expense on centers  which were built during the fiscal year in addition amortization of goodwill increased from million in to in fiscal resulting primarily from the full year amortization of the acquisition goodwill 
goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over fifteen years 
start up and development expenses are costs incurred to research and develop potential businesses in north america 
during fiscal the majority of start up and development costs were incurred by pph for the development of an eye specialty managed care business 
income tax expense increased from million in to million in this increase is a result of canadian center profits being taxed in canada where us losses cannot be applied to offset taxable income 
the net loss for fiscal was million or per share  compared to a loss of million or cents a share the previous year 
the similar loss is a result of a million smaller operating loss before start up and development expenses from refractive surgery being entirely offset by million poorer operating performance from secondary care operations which include million of non recurring charges at the chicago and seattle secondary care clinics 
the loss from refractive operations includes million in losses from beacon  which was acquired six weeks before the fiscal year end 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations to date through cash flow  the issuance of common shares  borrowings and capital lease financing 
at current levels of operations  the company is able to finance operations and a portion of its expansion plan

the proceeds of this offering are being used to finance primarily the acquisition and development of additional refractive surgery centers 
in july  tlc purchased a interest in the refractive surgery practice of dr 
thomas tooma a leading refractive surgeon in the state of california 
the company has also funded its investment in tlc usa llc  a venture with kaiser permanente  whereby tlc and kaiser will work together to bring kaiser patients and doctors to tlc facilities throughout the united states 
the company estimates that the net proceeds of its recent public offering  together with existing cash balances  funds expected to be generated from operations and available credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund the company s anticipated level of operations and its current acquisition and expansion plans for the next months 
working capital increased from million at may  to million at may   primarily due to the public offering completed on may  at may   unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaled million  an increase of million from the million balance on may  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended may  amounted to million  as compared to a use of tlc the laser center inc 
million for the year ended may  the increase in cash from operating activities is a result of the higher earnings before restructuring charges 
cash from financing activities was million 
this increase was a result of the may public share issue 
cash was used to prepay high cost debt and reduce the overall cost of capital to the company 
the company continued to invest in assets to develop and expand its refractive procedure capacity in anticipation of continued growth  through the development of new centers and acquisition of refractive practices 
at the current time  tlc has more than centers under development 
in addition  the company is actively pursuing other acquisition opportunities

see risk factors and the company s reports filed with the toronto stock exchange and the us securities and exchange commission from time to time for cautionary statements identifying important factors with respect to such forward looking statements  including certain risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ materially from results referred to in forward looking statements 
tlc assumes no obligation to update the information contained in this annual report 
outlook market the continuing growth of the laser vision correction industry is fueled by the increasing acceptance of the procedure in north american society 
the increasing consumer acceptance is a result of wider awareness and broader public understanding of the procedure and its safety and benefits 
business development strategy tlc will continue to work with local optometrists to continue to expand the co management model  which been a successful strategy for the company and the optometric community over the last few years 
the company expects to continue to open new facilities and acquire existing practices 
finally the company has developed new marketing strategies to capitalize on the broader public acceptance of the procedure 
as the market acceptance of laser vision correction continues to increase  tlc believes competition among service providers will continue and candidates for laser vision correction will increasingly select a provider based on factors other than solely the advice of a patient s doctor 
brand recognition will be a key factor for provider selection  and  consequently  tlc is developing a strong reputation and brand recognition 
tlc has dedicated greater resources towards enhancing its marketing programs directed at the public to increase tlc s brand recognition 
tlc is developing innovative marketing programs including the corporate advantage program  which is directed at vision plans  large employers  and employee associations to provide tlc with preferred access to large employee groups 
participating employers may subsidize the cost of an employee s refractive surgery at a tlc center and the procedure may be provided at a discounted price 
any price discounting offered by tlc must be in conjunction with a high expectation that volumes and therefore overall profitability would be substantially increased 
the cost to the employer of the subsidy may be offset by reductions in the ongoing cost of providing eyeglasses or other conventional vision correction 
in addition many employees see the availability of laser vision correction as a significant enhancement to an employer s benefit plan 
competition tlc faces competition in many of its markets 
tlc s brand stategy and strong reputation for high level of service and quality of care allows tlc to command a higher price 
tlc believes we have the best and most experienced doctors  the most advanced equipment  and best staff  which commands a price premium that the company believes patients are willing to pay 
other business segments the company has divested itself of several secondary care investments and does not expect to make further investments in secondary care facilities 
tlc believes it is now able to develop and maintain strong relationships with ophthalmologists without managing their secondary care practices 
tlc capital corporation was established as a wholly owned subsidiary to make passive strategic investments in refractive surgery and related businesses 
in fiscal tlc capital invested million into lasersight incorporated a leading developer of excimer laser technology who is currently seeking fda approval in the united states  aspen healthcare  vision corporation and vision source 
stock price fluctuation the stock prices of emerging high technology stocks are subject to significant fluctuations 
the stock price may be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to lower than expected growth in procedure volume  lower pricing  and higher costs associated with the high growth and market expansion 
in addition  if revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate adverse impact on the company s stock price

year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company completed a comprehensive study of the possible affects of the year issue on its systems and results of operations and a detailed plan of action including projected costs and contingency plans 
in august of  the company expects to complete a total company wide upgrade of its financial  operational systems and relevant hardware 
this upgrade will provide significant additional systems functionality and integration as well as enhanced internal communication tools to the whole organization 
as part of this upgrade the company believes that it has prepared its computer systems and related applications to accommodate date sensitive information relating to the year the company s systems constitute primarily desktop computers most of which are linked by a local area network server at individual locations 
the company has determined that its software applications for all essential functions  such as all financial applications  scheduling  center management and communications  are already year compliant 
any upgrades still to be done  mostly replacing some older desktop computers and relevant operating software  will not be material to the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
such costs will be expensed as incurred 
the company is continuing to monitor the yk compliance of its suppliers 
to date  no significant concerns have been identified 
however  there can be no assurance that year related issues with the providers of good and services will not have a material adverse affect on the financial condition or the results of operations of the company 
the company s core business is operating refractive laser surgery centers that are equipped with a computer controlled excimer laser as the primary essential piece of equipment 
visx incorporated visx manufactured approximately of the excimer lasers owned by the company 
representatives from visx have informed the company that it has tested its lasers for year compliance and that the lasers will function without any affect on safety or efficacy upon a change of date to the year however  without any upgrade  some visx lasers might print out patient reports with an incorrect date on them 
visx has developed a software upgrade to correct this problem and has installed the upgrade in the company s visx lasers at no cost to the company 
the company s refractive centers are equipped with other computer controlled ophthalmic equipment  but none are essential to the laser vision correction procedure 
the company does not expect that the cost of any replacements or upgrades required for other ophthalmic equipment in its laser centers for the year will be material to the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
laser vision correction is an elective procedure  which is not covered by medicare  medicaid or other governmental reimbursement programs 
there are some private insurance companies that provide partial or full coverage for the procedure  which the company estimates accounts for approximately of its revenues for the period from june  to may  in the event private insurance companies that cover the laser vision procedure have difficulty processing and paying claims because of year issues  this could cause accounts receivable for refractive procedures performed at the company s refractive centers to increase  or the patient volume in the tlc the laser center inc 
refractive centers operated by the company to decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company until such year problems are corrected 
most secondary care procedures are covered by governmental reimbursement programs  such as medicare or medicaid  and by private insurance companies 
in the event such third party payers have difficulty processing and paying claims because of year issues  this could cause delays in such payments and an increase in accounts receivable for procedures performed in secondary care in which the company has an investment 
further  the company cannot predict the impact that the year issue will have on its potential patients or the economy generally 
if the year issue were to have a significant adverse impact on the economy or potential patients perception of the economy  this could have a material adverse impact on the number of procedures performed  particularly with respect to elective procedures such as refractive surgery  and on the company s financial results until the economy and consumer confidence recover

in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company
