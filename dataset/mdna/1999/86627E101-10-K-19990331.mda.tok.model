year readiness disclosure the year issue is the result of computer programs that are not able to differentiate between the year and the year because they were written using two digits instead of four digits to define the applicable year 
internal operation a review of the company s internal computer systems and software packages has been performed to identify the systems and software that could be affected by this issue 
discovery of these systems and software is done through surveys and research of third party suppliers and manufactures 
the company will also be performing independent testing through the use of testing applications and scripting to simulate and test for year related issues 
those hardware devices  which include  but are not limited to  desktops  laptops  file servers  lan and wan hardware  pbx and voicemail  found not to be compliant have been or will be either replaced or upgraded to meet compliance 
the company currently believes that by either upgrading its software packages to currently available versions or replacing them  the year problem will not pose a significant operational problem to the company 
these software packages include  but not limited to  financials  manufacturing  payroll  customer service  email and local area network operating system 
a survey of vendors providing electronic information will be conducted and addressed 
installation of and testing of year compliant hardware and software is currently expected to be completed within the next six months 
the costs related to software upgrades are not anticipated to be material and have been incurred in the normal course of operations 
products the company currently offers two products which have the ability to process and store date time data the apex excimer laser and the apex plus excimer laser 
these lasers meet year compliance requirements although their capability to record date time does not impact clinical output 
the company has not surveyed third parties to inquire into their year compliance status 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unexpected costs and delays in achieving year compliance  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
year risks efforts are continually being made to ensure proper operation of the company s systems during the transition from to and beyond 
as well  internal testing  and year testing tools will be used to test the readiness of software applications for the year in the event of unforeseen or unanticipated issues related to the year  these issues may have material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
year contingency plans the company has not created a formal contingency plan for year problems 
the company intends to take appropriate actions to mitigate the effects of third parties failure to remediate their year issues and for unexpected failures in its own systems 
the company expects to make arrangements for some alternate suppliers and will continue to identify potential alternate suppliers 
if it becomes necessary for the company to take these corrective actions  it is uncertain whether this would result in significant interruptions in service or delays in business operations or whether it would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow
