the company has taken steps to improve the efficiencies of certain manufacturing processes in an effort to keep pace with demand for the company s products 
in the fourth quarter of  the company was unable to ship approximately  of customer orders of mostly new products due to capacity constraints 
during the fourth quarter  however  the company hired a significant number of production personnel in anticipation of increased customer demand 
the company will continue its efforts to increase capacity by improving manufacturing processes 
the failure to relieve capacity constraints could hinder the company s ability to deliver ordered products to customers in a timely manner 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  amounts in thousands except per share information sales increased to  in from  in  principally as a result of the continued increase in market acceptance of the company s point of sale pos products  an increase in sales of the company s holotrak industrial holographic laser scanners  and increased sales and marketing efforts

per share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  amounts in thousands except per share information sales increased to  in from  in  principally as a result of the continued increase in market acceptance of the company s hand held scanners  scan engines sold to oem s  holotrak holographic industrial scanners  and increased sales and marketing efforts  despite lower average unit selling prices compared to the prior period  primarily on certain of the company s pos products 
average unit selling prices reflected significant unfavorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
the reduction in the value of the german mark against the us dollar during negatively affected the recorded us dollar value of sales by approximately or approximately  in the year ended december  international sales accounted for  of total sales in and  of total sales in sales to one customer accounted for approximately of total sales in the company s sales to two customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of total sales in during these periods  no other customer accounted for more than of sales 
cost of sales increased to  in from  in  and cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to from 
these increases were due primarily to a reduction in the average selling prices on certain of the company s products  which average unit selling prices reflected the unfavorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations noted above 
an additional factor negatively affecting cost of sales included initial production and setup costs associated with holotrak industrial scanners  for sales levels of which had not yet achieved sufficient levels to fully absorb these costs 
the increases in cost of sales were partly offset by reduced product costs resulting from engineering enhancements to certain products and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from greater unit volumes 
if sales are adjusted to negate the effect of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations during  cost of sales as a percentage of sales would have been in compared with in sg a expenses increased to  in from  in and increased as a percentage of sales to from 
the increases were primarily due to increased salaries resulting from the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel throughout north america  europe and the rest of the world  and increased salaries resulting from the hiring of additional administration personnel during the year primarily due to the growth of the business

the company is a party to an amended and restated loan and security agreement  as amended  with its primary bank which provides for an unsecured line of credit in the amount of  the line of credit requires the company to comply with certain financial covenants and other restrictions 
as of december   the company was in compliance with these financial covenants and no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit 
the amended and restated loan and security agreement expires on june  the company also has a german mark unsecured revolving credit facility with a german bank in the name of its german subsidiary  metrologic instruments gmbh 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under this revolving credit facility 
in april  the company entered into a line of credit with its primary bank  denominated in german marks dm line  in an amount not to exceed  for the purchase of fixed assets

the company s liquidity has been  and may continue to be  adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly in the value of the german mark relative to the us dollar 
in an effort to mitigate the financial implications of the volatility in the exchange rate between the german mark and the us dollar  the company has selectively entered into derivative financial instruments to offset its exposure to foreign currency risks 
derivative financial instruments may include i foreign currency forward exchange contracts with its primary bank for periods not exceeding six months  which partially hedge future cash flows from sales to the company s german subsidiary and ii german mark based loans  which act as a partial hedge against the net assets of its german subsidiary 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalent balances  along with cash generated from operations and availability under its revolving credit facilities  will be adequate to fund the company s operations through at least the next twelve months 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs using only the last two digits to indicate the year 
if uncorrected  such computer programs will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause computer system failure or other computer errors disrupting operations 
the company has been evaluating its year readiness and taking corrective action where necessary 
the following discussion broadly addresses the company s efforts to identify and address the company s and relevant third parties year problems 
the scope of the year readiness effort includes i information technology it such as software and hardware  ii non it non it systems or embedded technology such as micro controllers contained in various manufacturing and lab equipment  facilities and utilities  and the company s products with date sensitivity  and iii readiness of key third parties  including suppliers and customers 
it would be impractical for the company to attempt to address all year problems of third parties that have been or may in the future be identified 
specifically  year problems have been or may in the future be identified with respect to the it and non it systems of third parties having widespread national and international interactions with persons and entities generally for example  certain it and non it systems of governmental agencies  utilities and telecommunications  information and financial networks that  if uncorrected  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
notwithstanding anything set forth below  the company is not in a position to address any such year problems 
if needed modifications and conversions are not made on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
i it 
the company s current it systems are not year compliant 
the company is in the process of replacing its current it system with a new  year compliant  fully integrated it system for itself and its subsidiaries 
the total cost of the new it system is estimated to be approximately  which includes external resource costs  a substantial portion of which will be capitalized 
through december   the company spent approximately the new it system s estimated implementation dates in the company s us operations will be phased in beginning may  with other application software currently scheduled for implementation in october  which is prior to any anticipated impact on the company s operating systems 
ii non it 
the company currently uses standard mass market vendor supplied software on its desktop systems and laptops 
these standard software applications limit the number of information technology vendors with which the company must work in order to ensure year readiness 
many of these vendors are still implementing their year compliance programs 
the company maintains maintenance contracts with all information technology vendors and will implement the year compliant versions of hardware and or software as required when those solutions become available 
the company s hardware for workstations  servers  and network routers are expected to be year compliant by the third quarter of as of december   approximately of the company s hardware and software applications were year compliant 
however  no assurance can be provided that all required replacement programs will be implemented in a timely manner or that the failure to implement such programs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
as of december   approximately of the company s facilities and manufacturing system were year compliant 
iii third parties 
the company is in contact with key suppliers in an effort to assure no interruption in the relationship between the company and these important third parties resulting from the year issue 
if third parties do not convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s systems  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company believes that its actions with respect to key suppliers and customers will minimize these risks 
as of december   of the company s suppliers constituting all significant vendors had responded affirmatively regarding their respective year readiness 
however  such response does not assure year compliance of the it and non it systems used by such suppliers  but instead provides only an indication of the status of their efforts 
the company s current estimates of the time and costs necessary to resolve year issues are based on the facts and circumstances existing at this time 
the estimates were made using assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  year modification plans  implementation success by key third parties  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the company currently anticipates that any identified year problem affecting its own systems or that of its significant customers  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations and utilities providers will be either corrected by december  or will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  the company is working to minimize any disruption to the business of its vendors and suppliers due to year problems that may have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition or results of its operations 
however  notwithstanding the company s efforts to identify and correct such year problems  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing the year problems as they pertain to its products and its internal systems  or that the failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  notwithstanding such efforts  there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties with which the company interacts will not suffer from year problems  or that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in particular  year problems that have been or may in the future be identified with respect to the it and non it systems of third parties having widespread national and international interactions with persons and entities generally for example  certain it and non it systems of governmental agencies  utilities and information and financial networks could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company currently is in the process of reviewing its year compliance plans to determine what contingency plans  if any  are appropriate 
the company does not currently have any contingency plans 
the company anticipates completing such review and preparing contingency plans  if appropriate  by october there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent the occurrence of year problems  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
euro conversion 
on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro traded on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  the countries that adopted the euro on january  are austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal  and spain 
during the transition period  non cash payments can be made in the euro  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or legacy currency 
between january  and january  the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border transparency 
the company is assessing its pricing marketing strategy in order to insure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
the company is also assessing its information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies  and is reviewing whether certain existing contracts will be need to be modified 
the company s currency risk and risk management for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
pronouncements adopted in in december  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  sfas which established new standards for reporting information about operating segments  geographic areas  and major customers 
interim reporting requirements under sfas becomes effective for the company s quarterly reporting beginning in adoption of sfas had no effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
as required by sfas  the company has modified certain disclosures on segment reporting and geographic areas 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop no 
accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company followed the sop in accounting for the costs of computer software obtained for internal use during pending accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments 
sfas requires recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet  to be measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the value of derivatives would be accounted for depending on the intended use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for the company s financial statements beginning in the company is currently reviewing the effects of adopting sfas however  due to the company s limited use of derivative financial instruments  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations financial position  or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments 
the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
interest rate risk 
the company s bank loans expose earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are either variable or fixed for such a short period of time as to effectively become variable 
the fair values of the company s bank loans are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
the change in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates is not material 
foreign exchange risk 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  namely the german mark  thereby mitigating the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
principal transactions hedged are intercompany purchases 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the company s statement of earnings 
a large percentage of the company s foreign sales are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international operating results are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical five percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against the german mark could have had a impact on the net earnings of the company 
actual results may differ 
the company is subject to risk from fluctuations in the value of the german mark relative to the us dollar for its subsidiary  which uses the german mark as their functional currency and translated into us dollars in consolidation 
such changes result in cumulative translation adjustments which are included in other comprehensive income loss 
at december   the company had translation exposure 
the potential effect on other comprehensive income loss resulting from a hypothetical change in the quoted german mark rate amounts to actual results may differ 
in addition  the company holds debt denominated in german marks and recognizes foreign currency translation adjustments in net income 
the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the quoted german mark rate is approximately actual results may differ
