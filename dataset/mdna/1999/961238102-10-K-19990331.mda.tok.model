year general description of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
in  the company began a company wide project to replace all existing information systems with improved systems launched from a newer technology infrastructure and  as a by product  make the new systems year compliant 
the company presently believes that with replacements and modifications of existing software and certain hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
to date  the company has completed its assessment of all systems that could be significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems could be affected 
that assessment also indicated that in some cases software and hardware embedded chips used in production and manufacturing systems hereafter also referred to as operating equipment were also at risk 
affected systems included automated assembly lines and related robotics technologies used in various aspects of the manufacturing process 
however  based on a review of its product line  the company determined that none of the products it has sold and will continue to sell required remediation to be year compliant 
accordingly  the company does not believe that the year issue presents a material exposure as it relates to the company s products 
in addition  the company has gathered information about the year compliance status of its significant customers  suppliers and subcontractors and continues to monitor their compliance 
status of progress in becoming year compliant the company is on schedule with its plan for addressing the year issue 
by march   the company had determined that of its systems were year compliant and has completed an assessment  remediation and testing of its most critical systems 
all implementation is expected to be completed by june  the company will include the year issue as part of its disaster recovery testing throughout the remainder of nature and level of importance of third parties and their exposure to the year issue the company has surveyed key production  non production  service  utility and communication suppliers to determine their state of readiness 
responses indicate most key vendors plan to be compliant in a timely manner 
edi interfaces with suppliers general continued nature and level of importance of third parties and their exposure to the year issue continued are being tested  and early results indicate the company s supplier interfaces and procurement systems are compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that suppliers systems  or their suppliers systems  upon which the company relies  will be ready in a timely manner and will not have a material effect on the company 
the company has surveyed key customers who electronically interface with the company via edi to determine their state of readiness and plan for testing compliant interfaces 
responses received from a majority of key customers indicate that they expect to be compliant and able to test compliant interfaces 
however  there can be no assurance that all customers systems  upon which the company relies  will be ready in a timely manner and will not have a material effect on the company 
to date  the company is not aware of any third party with a year issue that will materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that third parties will be year ready 
the inability of third parties to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
costs  risks and contingency plans for the year issue the company has and will continue to utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of that amount  the company estimates it has incurred approximately  to date  related to all phases of the year project and not related to the systems improvement project started in the company has a high dependence on computer processes such as electronic order and shipment information that automatically drive business processes  bar codes that cannot be reproduced manually  and machinery containing advanced technology requiring computerized controls 
the company s business transaction volume is concentrated among a few customers who also have a high dependence upon computers 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to address the year issue in a timely manner  however  in the event that the company does not complete all necessary remaining phases of the year program  the company may experience some difficulties in operating its equipment 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could have a material effect upon the company 
the company is updating its contingency plans based on the current status of its progress toward becoming year compliant 
contingency plans will continue to address potential needs during the actual transition of operations on january  in addition  the company is planning the development of a year business continuity plan for its critical business functions that will include potential failure by critical third parties to address the year issue 
the costs of the year project and the date on which management of the company believes it will complete year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which are derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties

impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company expects to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
risk management and market sensitive instruments the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in certain commodity prices and interest rates 
these exposures primarily relate to the acquisition of raw materials and changes in interest rates 
commodities risk 
the company selectively uses commodity futures contracts  forward purchase commodity contracts and option contracts to manage certain of its commodities exposures 
such contracts are used principally to manage the company s exposure to cotton commodity price risk 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
risk management and market sensitive instruments continued at december   the company  in its normal course of business  had entered into various commodity future contracts and forward purchase commodity contracts 
at the end of  a sharp decline in demand for cotton as a result of conditions in asia as well as the termination of the u 
s 
government s subsidy program caused a steep decline in long term cotton prices 
thus  based on year end forward cotton prices  the company s futures contracts and forward purchase contracts at december  which covered a portion of its needs had a net deferred loss of approximately million 
however  management believes that the company s cost of cotton for will be at least as favorable as the cost of cotton in the hypothetical incremental loss in earnings for the combined commodity positions at december  is estimated to be approximately million  assuming a decrease of in commodity prices 
the sensitivity analysis for commodities reflects the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in the market price for such commodities 
actual commodity price volatility is dependent on many varied factors impacting supply and demand that are impossible to forecast 
therefore  actual changes in fair value over time could differ substantially from the hypothetical change disclosed above 
interest rate risk 
based on the company s floating rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point increase in market rates would increase interest expense and decrease income before income taxes by approximately million 
the amount was determined by calculating the effect of the hypothetical interest rate on the company s floating rate debt 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term fixed rate debt at december  was approximately  million  which exceeded its carrying value by approximately million 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in the prevailing interest rates at december  would result in an increase in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair market values are determined from quoted market prices where available or based on estimates made by investment bankers 
effects of inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant impact on its sales or profitability 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash from its operations and funds available under the senior credit facility 
at february   the maximum commitment under the senior credit facility was million and the company had unused borrowing availability under the senior credit facility totaling million 
the senior credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  limit indebtedness and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and minimum net worth as defined 
the company s principal uses of cash for the next several years will be operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service requirements related primarily to interest payments 
the company spent approximately million in on capital expenditures and intends to invest approximately million in during  the company purchased approximately million shares under its various stock repurchase programs  at an average price of per share 
as of february   the board of directors has approved the purchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock  subject to the company s debt limitations 
at december   approximately million shares  including the million share increase announced in february  remained to be purchased under these programs 
the company  through a bankruptcy remote receivables subsidiary  has a trade receivables program which provides for the sale of accounts receivable  on a revolving basis 
at december  and december   million and million  respectively  had been sold under this program and the sale is reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the cost of the trade receivables program in is estimated to total approximately million  compared with million in  and will be charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources continued debt service requirements for interest payments in are estimated to total approximately million excluding amounts related to the trade receivables program compared with interest payments of million in the company s long term indebtedness has no scheduled principal requirements during management believes that cash from the company s operations and borrowings under its credit agreements will provide the funding necessary to meet the company s anticipated requirements for capital expenditures and operating expenses and to enable it to meet its anticipated debt service requirements
