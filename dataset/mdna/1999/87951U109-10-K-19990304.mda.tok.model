possible business relationships  
dependence on key personnel  
exposure to year issues  and

our actual future results may differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements set forth in this form k for a number of reasons  including the inability to 
integrate our operations with those of idrc in a prompt and effective manner  
meet greater debt service requirements following the assumption by us of the idrc senior debt

recent developments overview idrc merger agreement on january   we entered into a merger agreement with international data response corporation and its majority stockholders 
this agreement was amended on february  under this agreement  the holders of outstanding idrc common stock and options will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of an aggregate of million shares and warrants exercisable for million shares of our common stock 
these warrants would be exercisable during the period between the first and seventh anniversaries of the completion of the merger at an exercise price of per share 
in addition  the idrc preferred stock will be exchanged for million in cash  plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
the majority stockholder of idrc  mccown de leeuw co 
will be required to invest all of their proceeds from the exchange of their idrc preferred stock  estimated at approximately million  to purchase a term note from us 
this note will be payable in one year and bear interest at 
we will account for the idrc merger as a purchase by us pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
business combinations 
we received a financing commitment for a new million senior debt facility which will be used to replace our current facility and to refinance idrc s current maturities of long term debt  long term debt and seller notes 
if the idrc merger is completed  we will incur debt issuance costs associated with this facility of approximately million 
we would amortize these costs over four years 
this debt facility will consist of three term notes in the aggregate of million with maturities between and months and a revolving credit facility of million due in months 
the debt facility allows for alternative interest rates 
after three months  we can elect libor plus a margin of to 
the debt facility contains various financial and non financial covenants  including minimum interest coverage  fixed charge coverage  minimum ebitda  maximum leverage ratio and limitations on capital expenditures

of a share of telespectrum common stock 
in addition  each outstanding option to purchase shares of crw common stock will be exchanged for an option to purchase 
of a share of telespectrum common stock 
the warrants issued by crw to purchase million shares of our common stock owned by crw will be unaffected by this merger 
crw does not have any continuing business operations and its only significant asset is million shares of our common stock 
for financial reporting purposes  we will treat the exchange of our shares of common stock for shares of crw common stock as a treasury stock transaction 
the transaction will not have an effect on our net income or loss  but will have an effect on our net income or loss per share 
we expect to complete the merger in the second quarter of litigation with ntc in july  we commenced litigation in federal court against parcel consultants incorporation d b a ntc 
we filed suit as part of our efforts to collect approximately million of accounts receivable from telemarketing services performed on behalf of ntc 
ntc filed a counter suit against us alleging breach of contract and fraud 
we believe that ntc s claims against us are without merit 
in february  ntc filed for reorganization under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
we have reserved approximately million of the accounts receivable due from ntc 
we believe that our reserve is adequate  however  we cannot assure that we will be successful in collecting this receivable from ntc 
net loss we incurred a net loss of million for we incurred net losses of million in the first six months of we primarily attribute these losses to the costs associated with reducing our excess capacity in the first six months of we achieved net income of million for the last six months of  which we primarily attribute to reduced costs and higher capacity utilization at our call centers 
discontinued operations in the first quarter of  we sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our market research segment and our direct mail and fulfillment segment for approximately million in cash 
these dispositions resulted in a loss of approximately million which we recorded as of december  we used the proceeds from these sales to repay all outstanding borrowings on our secured credit facility 
goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of  as a result of our operating performance and the overall significant changes in our industry outlook  we performed an in depth evaluation of the carrying value of our goodwill 
as a result of this evaluation  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  which represented the goodwill associated with our telemarketing segment 
as of december   our remaining goodwill of million relates exclusively to our customer care segment  which we believe is realizable

also  as of december   we had approximately million of future income tax deductible amounts related to our goodwill impairment charge 
the goodwill impairment becomes deductible for income tax purposes over the next years

excluding these costs relating to call center closings  our costs of services increased from for to for as a percentage of total telemarketing revenues 
we attribute this increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenues primarily to increased capacity  which resulted in the lower utilization of our telemarketing personnel and facilities

cost of services our cost of services are related to the operations of the initial operating business from august  through december  as well as the operations of two businesses that were acquired in the fourth quarter of our cost of services decreased as a percentage of revenues due to certain operating efficiencies  among other factors  however  the favorable effects of these cost savings have been offset by additional start up costs of the new centers

our net loss of million was reduced by significant non cash items including depreciation and amortization 
the million of cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of million of proceeds from the sale of the market research segment and direct mail and fulfillment segment  primarily offset by million of purchases of property and equipment

under the terms of the credit facility  we can borrow up to the lesser of million or an amount that is determined as of the net eligible accounts receivable 
we can elect at the time of our borrowings to pay interest at prime plus or at libor plus and will pay a commitment fee of on the unused borrowing capacity 
the credit facility also makes available letters of credit at a fee of per annum on the face amount of each letter of credit and in an aggregate amount not to exceed the lower of million or the amount available under the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are collaterlized by substantially all of our assets 
the credit facility also contains various financial and non financial covenants 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings and million of available borrowings under the credit facility 
we believe that our existing cash balances  and borrowings available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs into the amount of future capital expenditures will be highly dependent on future revenue growth 
on january   we entered into a merger agreement with idrc 
in connection with the merger agreement  we received a financing commitment for a new million senior debt facility which will be used to replace our current credit facility and to refinance idrc s debt 
should the merger close  we believe that our existing cash balances and borrowings available under the new million senior debt facility will be sufficient to meet our combined operating and capital needs into year ended december  the million of cash provided by operating activities consisted of million generated from continuing operations and million generated from discontinued operations

the net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million of net proceeds from borrowing under our credit facility dated january   as amended 
in addition  we received million of proceeds from other long term debt and made payments on debt and capital lease obligations totaling approximately million 
throughout  we amended the credit facility several times as a result of non compliance due to our operating performance 
on march   we were notified by our primary lending institution  mellon  that we were in default of certain loan covenants of our credit facility 
we repaid this facility on april   with the proceeds from the sale of our direct mail and fulfillment segment 
period from april  inception to december  at december  we had cash of million

we used million for operating activities  primarily to fund our working capital requirements during this period of high growth 
year year issue 
the year issue results from the writing of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
because of this programming convention  computer software  hardware or firmware may recognize a date using as the year rather than year this could result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruptions of operations or other business problems  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
state of readiness 
we have undertaken a comprehensive program  including the hiring of an outside consulting firm  to address the year issue with respect to the following 
our information technology and operating systems  which include call processing  network  server  security and application systems  
our non information technology systems that may contain embedded microchip technology  which include buildings  plant  equipment and other infrastructure systems  and 
the systems of our major vendors and telecommunication service providers insofar as they relate to our business 
our core business systems are in the process of receiving year compliant upgrades furnished by our vendors  being replaced by our telespectrum enterprise system solution tess  or being rewritten to be year compliant 
we are developing tess to replace many of our current data processing systems 
we believe that the tess product will be year compliant and that our core business systems will be ready to successfully recognize years beginning with although we have received compliance information from many suppliers  we are unable to predict the extent to which our suppliers will be affected by the year issue 
we are also unable to predict the extent to which we may be vulnerable to a supplier s inability to remedy any issues in a timely manner 
this matter is most prevalent with our telecommunications service suppliers 
costs to address the year issue 
our current cost estimate to become year compliant is  in  of which approximately will be for outside consultants and will be for internal resource which have been or will be reallocated from other projects 
many of our systems that require year remediation or replacement are also simultaneously receiving performance upgrades or feature enhancements 
our current cost estimate does not include costs related to these upgrades or enhancements 
to date  the financial impact of remediation expenses has not been material  and we do not expect future remediation costs to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risks presented by year problems 
our reasonably anticipated worst case scenario involves year problems experienced by our suppliers 
if our telecommunications vendors do not appropriately address their year issues and alternative telecommunications providers are not able to provide us with adequate telecommunications services  we will not be able to provide our services to our clients 
if there is widespread and continued shortage in telecommunications services available from telecommunications vendors  we will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our computer systems are linked to many of our clients computer systems 
through these links  clients furnish us with information that is necessary for us to provide our services and we provide our clients with feedback regarding their services 
while we have made inquiries regarding their state of readiness for the year  we may not be able to accurately predict whether our clients systems will be year compliant 
we will likely experience service disruptions and may be materially adversely affected if our clients systems are not year compliant 
contingency plans 
our year plan calls for the development of contingency plans for areas of our business that are susceptible to a substantive risk of a disruption resulting from a year related event 
for our internal systems  we are developing remediation plans for our existing systems  including as a contingency to the timely implementation of tess 
for vendor supplied services  we are evaluating alternative vendors for backup services 
however  we may not be able to obtain backup services if there is a widespread and continued shortage in telecommunications services available from telecommunications vendors 
for client computer links  we will seek to exchange information on a manual basis until such time as the necessary corrections have been made 
consistent with our year plan  we will develop specific year contingency plans for any other areas of our business as the need is identified 
other information risk factors risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this form k 
keep these risk factors in mind when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this document 
these are statements that relate to future events and time periods or our expectations 
generally  the words anticipates  expects  intends and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
operating losses while we have had net income of million for the six months ended december   we had a net loss of million for the year ended december  and a net loss of million for the six months ended june  to be profitable  we must maintain a sufficient level of capacity utilization at acceptable rates 
during the past two years we have periodically found difficulties in achieving consistent levels of profitability  particularly in our telemarketing segment 
revenues from our telemarketing segment represented of our total revenues in telemarketing agreements generally do not assure specific levels of revenue and are often terminable by clients on short notice 
the amount of revenue we generate from a particular client is dependent upon a number of factors  including  our ability to achieve marketing and sales results required by the client and the results we achieve as compared to both the clients in house operations and other telemarketing providers 
in addition to these factors  numerous agreements with our clients are also based on actual sales achieved 
accordingly  our ability to achieve our desired results of operations is also contingent upon our tsrs being able to effectively and efficiently market the clients products and the quality of the lists of prospective customers provided by our clients 
our telemarketing segment is also affected by seasonal trends that mirror our client s marketing plans 
these trends include reduced activities during the months of august and december 
if we are unable to maintain a sufficient level of capacity utilization at acceptable rates  we will be materially and adversely affected 
reliance on major clients approximately of our revenues in were generated from one client  in the telecommunications industry 
in  approximately of our revenues were generated from one client in the financial services industry 
the significant reduction in the amount of business provided by this client in the financial services industry was a significant factor in our lower capacity utilization and operating performance during the last two fiscal quarters in we may in the future develop relationships with clients that represent a large concentration of revenues 
since most client contracts can generally be canceled by the client upon relatively short notice  we will be vulnerable to any unexpected termination or non renewal of such a relationship 
difficulties of managing growth we have experienced growth over the past several years 
we will not be able to achieve future growth if we do not 
initiate  develop and maintain new client relationships and expand its existing client programs  
recruit  motivate and retain qualified management  staff  tsrs and csrs  
rapidly identify  acquire or lease suitable call center facilities on acceptable terms and complete build outs of such facilities in a timely and economic fashion  and 
maintain the high quality of the services and products that we provide to our clients 
capacity utilization our profitability is substantially dependent upon our ability to use our call center capacity at favorable rates 
we have in the past experienced periods of low capacity utilization and we have sometimes accepted less profitable client engagements to fill this capacity 
we have also experienced  and in the future may experience  at least short term  excess peak period capacity when we open a new call center or terminate or complete a large client program 
if we do not maintain sufficient levels of capacity utilization at acceptable rates  we will be materially adversely affected 
reliance on technology we have made significant investments in technology and we anticipate that we will need to continue making significant additional technology investments to remain competitive 
we may not be successful in anticipating continuing technological changes or in implementing new or enhanced technology 
if we are unable to do so  we will be materially adversely affected 
dependence on our labor force our industry is very labor intensive and has experienced high personnel turnover 
many of our employees receive modest hourly wages 
a higher turnover rate among our employees would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our productivity 
our insurance product sales and technology based customer care services require specifically trained employees 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified employees 
if we are unable to do so  we will be materially adversely affected 
additional financing should the merger with idrc close  we will have significant outstanding borrowings under our new million senior debt facility 
there can be no assurance  that existing cash and available borrowings  after the close of the merger  will be sufficient to meet our financing needs and satisfy our debt obligations 
if these sources are not sufficient  we will be required to seek additional debt or equity financing and there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to meet our debt obligations as they become due  we will be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on telecommunications providers our business is heavily dependent on service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies 
we would be materially adversely affected by a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services  or any significant interruption in telephone services 
year issue the year issue results from the writing of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
because of this programming convention  computer software  hardware or firmware may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruptions of operations or other business problems  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
as a result of the year issue  possible consequences to our business include the inability to engage in normal business activities resulting from one or more of the following 
failure of our telecommunications services 
failure of third parties to provide us with year compliant products or services  
failure of our information systems  or 
the inability of our customers to process telemarketing and customer care transactions 
not all of our information systems are year compliant and not all of the third parties with whom we conduct our business have indicated that their information systems are year compliant 
we are in the process of making changes to  or replacing  our core business systems to make them year compliant 
we have been notified by our third parties with whom we conduct our business that they are in the process of becoming year compliant 
however  if we and these third parties do not complete this work effectively or on time  we will be materially adversely affected 
we discuss the impact that the year issue may have on our business  our expected costs to address our year issues and our contingency plans earlier in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this form k 
potential fluctuation in quarterly operating results we expect that our quarterly operating results will fluctuate due to many factors  a number of which are beyond our control 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on these historical results as an indication of future results 
our results of operations in future periods may not meet the expectations of analysts and investors  in which case the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
factors  which may also have an impact on our operating results 
our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients  
timing of our clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  
the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses incurred to acquire and support such new business  
changes in our revenue mix among our various service offerings  
the introduction of new or enhanced services and products  
price competition  
our ability to upgrade and develop our information technology systems  
technical difficulties  system downtime or internet brownouts  
government regulation  
general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to our industry  and 
seasonality in our business  particularly during the months of august and december 
possible volatility of stock prices the market prices of our common stock have been highly volatile 
this volatility may adversely affect the price of our common stock in the future 
factors that could cause such volatility include 
volume of trading in our stock  
our quarterly operating results  
deviations in results of operations from estimates of changes in general conditions in the economy or our industry  and 
other developments affecting us or our competitors 
risks relating to the pending mergers we have entered into merger agreements providing for the mergers with idrc and crw 
we have incurred considerable expense in negotiating these merger agreements and in working to complete these mergers 
in addition  if we complete the idrc merger  we will incur approximately million of additional senior debt 
if we complete these mergers  we will need to address a number of matters to be successful 
these matters will include 
integrating the operations of the companies  
meeting increased debt service obligations  
developing and implementing new business strategies  
operating effectively with a new management team  and 
avoiding incurring any unknown liabilities 
we can not assure that we will be able to complete either merger 
because we have committed substantial resources to these mergers  we will be adversely affected if we are unable to complete these mergers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we do not believe that we have exposure to market risks associated with changing interest rates as of december  because we do not have variable rate interest debt outstanding and all of our outstanding debt consists of term notes with state and regional development authorities and capital lease obligations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations 
foreign currency risk we do not use foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have subsidiaries in canada and the united kingdom  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of income statements of these subsidiaries from local currencies to us dollars affects year over year comparability of our operating results 
the foreign subsidiaries are limited in their operations and the level of investment by the parent company so that the risk of foreign currency fluctuations is not expected to be material
