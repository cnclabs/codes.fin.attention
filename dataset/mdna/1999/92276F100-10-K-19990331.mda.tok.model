item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of background information on the company and a discussion of the consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity and capital resources of the company  which should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
background information the company has announced its intention to operate and be treated as a self administered  self managed reit for federal income tax purposes beginning january  the company is a real estate company that owns or leases hospitals comprised of two acute care hospitals and long term care hospitals  nursing centers and eight personal care facilities as of december  the company s portfolio of properties are located in states and are leased and operated primarily by vencor or its subsidiaries 
the company conducts all of its business through a wholly owned operating partnership  ventas realty  limited partnership 
the company was incorporated in kentucky in as vencare  inc and commenced operations in it was reorganized as a delaware corporation in and changed its name to vencor  incorporated in and to vencor  inc in on september   the hillhaven corporation merged with and into the company 
on march   the company acquired theratx  incorporated  a provider of subacute rehabilitation and respiratory therapy program management services to nursing centers and an operator of nursing centers 
on june   the company acquired transitional hospitals corporation  an operator of long term acute care hospitals and three satellite facilities located in states 
on may   the company effected the reorganization pursuant to which the company was separated into two publicly held corporations 
a new corporation  subsequently renamed vencor  inc  was formed to operate the hospital  nursing center and ancillary services businesses 
pursuant to the terms of the reorganization  the company distributed the common stock of vencor to stockholders of record of the company as of april  the company  through its subsidiaries  continued to hold title to substantially all of the real property and to lease such real property to vencor 
at such time  the company also changed its name to ventas  inc and refinanced substantially all of its long term debt 
for financial reporting periods subsequent to the reorganization  the historical financial statements of the company were assumed by vencor and the company is deemed to have commenced operations on may  accordingly  the company does not have comparable financial results for prior periods 
in addition  for certain reporting purposes under this form k and other filings  the commission treats the company as having commenced operations on may  the company s principal objectives are to maximize funds from operations for distribution to stockholders  to enhance capital growth through the appreciation of the residual value of its portfolio of properties  and to preserve and maintain the stockholders capital 
results of operations rental income for the eight months ended december  totaled million  of which million resulted from leases with vencor 
income from operations was million  or per share 
the company incurred an extraordinary loss for the eight months of million  or per share  net of income taxes  related to the extinguishment of debt 
net income for the eight months was million  or per share 
the company considers funds from operations ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit  and with the exception of non cash compensation expense  the company uses the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
pro forma ffo assumes that the company qualified to be taxed as a reit on may   and the provision for income taxes was therefore excluded 
pro forma ffo is defined to mean net income available to common stockholders determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding income taxes  gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets and certain non cash compensation expense 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
pro forma ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  pro forma ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this form k 
pro forma ffo for the eight months ended december  are summarized in the following table eight months ended december  in thousands net income  extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt  net of income tax benefit of   income from operations before extraordinary loss  provision for income taxes  pro forma income from operations  depreciation on real estate assets  certain non cash compensation expense pro forma funds from operations  on a pro forma basis  excluding the provision for income taxes based upon the assumption that the company qualified to be taxed as a reit on may   ffo for the eight months would have totaled million  or per share 
pro forma income from operations would have been million  or per share 
rental income would not have changed on a pro forma basis for the eight month period 
interest expense includes interest of million on the company s bank credit agreement described below  swap payments of million on the company s interest rate swap agreement described below and million of interest on other obligations 
asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of the company s overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily interest rate risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses the company s integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
market risk the company earns revenue by leasing its assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s debt obligations are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related cash flows vary with the movement in the london interbank offered rate libor 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the general fixed nature of the company s assets and the variable nature of the company s debt obligations creates interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  the company s lease revenue might not be sufficient to meet its debt obligations 
in order to mitigate this risk  at or about the date the company spun off its healthcare operations under the reorganization  it also entered into interest rate swaps to convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount 
as of december   the company had million of interest rate swaps outstanding with a highly rated counterparty in which the company pays a fixed rate of to the counterparty and receives libor from the counterparty 
when interest rates rise the interest rate swap agreement increases in market value to the company and when interest rates fall the interest rate swap agreement declines in value to the company 
since the interest rate swap agreement was executed  interest rates have generally been lower and the market value of the interest rate swap agreement has been an unrealized loss to the company 
as of december   the interest rate swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position to the company of approximately million 
to highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swap agreement to changes in interest rates the following summary shows the effects of an instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  market value to the company reflecting change in market value interest rates to the company at notional amount december  bps bps the terms of this interest rate swap agreement require that the company make a cash payment or otherwise post collateral  such as a letter of credit from one of the banks identified in the bank credit agreement to the counterparty if the market value loss to the company exceed certain levels the threshold levels 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the threshold levels vary based on the relationship between the company s debt obligations and the tangible fair market value of its assets as defined in the bank credit agreement 
as of december   the threshold level under the interest rate swap agreement was a market value loss of million and the interest rate swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position to the company of million 
under the interest rate swap agreement  if collateral must be posted  the principal amount of such collateral must equal the difference between the market value of the interest rate swap at the time of such determination and the threshold amount 
as of december   the company had a letter of credit outstanding as posted collateral under the interest rate swap agreement in the amount of million  which reduced the availability of the company s revolving line of credit under its bank credit agreement as of that date by a similar amount 
as of march   the market value unrealized loss of the interest rate swap agreement had declined below the million threshold to million and the letter of credit outstanding had been reduced to one dollar 
under the bank credit agreement  the maximum amount that may be outstanding under such letters of credit at anytime is million 
credit risk the company monitors credit risk under its lease agreements with its lessees by monitoring publicly available financial information  discussions with its lessees and review of information otherwise available to the company 
pursuant to the reorganization  the company has a significant concentration of credit risk under its four master lease agreements with vencor 
for the eight months ended december   lease revenues from vencor comprised million  or approximately of the company s total lease revenues of million 
accordingly  vencor s financial condition and ability to meet its rent obligations will determine the company s revenues and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders 
the operations of vencor have been negatively impacted by changes in reimbursement rates  by its current level of indebtedness and by certain other factors 
see business recent developments and business governmental regulation 
in addition  any failure by vencor to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities 
there can be no assurance that vencor will have sufficient assets  income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the master leases 
since the company derives in excess of of its revenues from vencor and since the master leases are triple net leases under which vencor is responsible for all insurance  taxes and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties  the inability of vencor to satisfy its obligations under the master leases would have a material adverse effect on the condition of the leased properties  as well as on the results of operations and the financial condition of the company and on the ability of the company to meet the terms of the bank credit agreement  and could prevent the company from paying dividends to its stockholders as required to maintain its status as a reit

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations totaled million for the eight months ended december  net cash provided by investing activities totaled 
million 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million 
in connection with the reorganization  the company refinanced substantially all of its long term debt 
in connection with the refinancing arrangements  the company entered into a billion bank credit agreement  dated april   with nationsbank  na  as administrative agent the bank credit agreement and retained approximately million of prior debt obligations 
the bank credit agreement comprises i a three year million revolving credit facility priced at libor plus to the revolving credit facility  ii a million term a loan payable in various installments over three years priced at libor plus to  iii a million term b loan payable in various installments over five years priced at libor plus to  and iv a million loan due on october  priced at libor plus to 
for the eight months ended december   the company paid million in financing fees related to establishing the bank credit agreement 
as of december   the outstanding balances under the bank credit agreement and related principal payments due in are as follows balance current dec 
 maturity million revolving credit facility  million term a loan  million term b loan   million loan due october    at december   available borrowings under the revolving credit facility approximated million 
subsequent to december   the company borrowed million under its revolving credit facility and used the proceeds to pay down the million loan due october  the company intends to pay down or refinance the remaining million loan due october   on or prior to its maturity 
the company expects to obtain the necessary proceeds to pay down or refinance the remaining million loan due october  and to meet other liquidity requirements through cash flows from operations  available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  the issuance of public or private debt or equity and asset sales  or a combination of the foregoing 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to pay down or refinance the million loan and to meet its other liquidity requirements 
as of march   the company had outstanding borrowings and available borrowings under its revolving credit facility of million and million  respectively 
the million is subject to certain restrictions under the bank credit agreement 
in addition  as of march   cash and overnight investments in banks totaled million 
the company leases substantially all its properties to vencor and  therefore  vencor is the primary source of the company s revenues 
vencor s financial condition and ability to satisfy its rent obligations under the master leases will impact the company s revenues and its ability to service its indebtedness and to make distributions to its stockholders 
because the operations of vencor have been negatively impacted by changes in reimbursement rates  by its current level of indebtedness and by certain other factors  and because of the potential effect of such events on vencor s ability to meet its rent obligations to the company  the company s auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in its report to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  that expresses substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the existence of the explanatory paragraph may have a material adverse affect on the company s relationships with its creditors and could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management has taken certain initiatives to address these issues 
the company has retained merrill lynch co  as financial advisor  to assist it in its review of vencor s financial condition and its ability to comply with the covenants in its bank credit facility 
merrill lynch is also assisting the company in its review of alternatives to repaying the million portion of its credit facility that matures on october  and to assess other strategic alternatives for the company 
the company has increased its cash position so that it has cash and overnight investment  in banks  totaling million as of march  the company and vencor have discussed vencor s recent results of operations and vencor s need to amend or restructure its existing indebtedness 
in those discussions  vencor has requested interim rent concessions under the master leases and the company has rejected that request 
the company will consider appropriate action to take in response to any further proposals by vencor as may be in the best interests of the company 
the company has entered into an agreement with vencor whereby the company has agreed not to exercise remedies for non payment of rent  which is due from vencor on april   for a period ending on april  during the company s discussions with vencor  vencor has asserted various potential claims against the company arising out of the reorganization 
the company intends to vigorously defend these claims if they are asserted in a legal mediation or proceeding 
as of march   the company was in compliance with the covenants contained in the bank credit agreement 
continued payment of rent by vencor under the master leases is essential to the company s ability to remain in compliance with the covenants contained in the bank credit facility 
in connection with the reorganization  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to eliminate the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt obligations 
the agreement expires in varying amounts through december and provides for the company to pay a fixed rate at and receive libor floating rate 
the fair value of the swap agreement is not recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements 
see asset liability management and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the reorganization  the company sought to obtain necessary consents to assign its former third party lease obligations to vencor 
the company has not and does not expect to receive consents for assignments on one long term care hospital and nursing centers 
the company remains primarily liable on substantially all lease obligations assigned to vencor  as well as certain third party guarantees 
vencor has contractually indemnified the company for these leases and guaranty obligations 
see business relationship with vencor and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company loaned  with interest provisions  approximately million to certain former executive officers of the company to finance the income taxes payable by them as a result of the reorganization 
the loans are payable over a ten year period 
in connection with the reorganization  the company also received newly issued vencor series a non voting convertible preferred stock 
the company sold the preferred stock to certain of its employees  which includes both current vencor employees and employees of the company  for million and used the proceeds to refinance long term debt 
in order to qualify as a reit  the company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gain 
under certain circumstances  the company may be required to make distributions in excess of ffo in order to meet such distribution requirements 
in such event  the company presently would expect to borrow funds  or to sell assets for cash  to the extent necessary to obtain cash sufficient to make the distributions required to retain its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes although there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such efforts 
although the company is currently expected to qualify as a reit for the year ending december   it is possible that economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause the company to fail to qualify as a reit 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally will be incurred by the tenants 
accordingly  the company does not believe that it will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased properties 
after the terms of the leases expire  or in the event that the tenants are unable to meet their obligations under the leases  the company anticipates that any expenditures for which it may become responsible to maintain the leased properties will be funded by cash flows from operations and  in the case of major expenditures  through additional borrowings  asset sales or issuances of equity 
to the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required  the company s liquidity may be affected adversely 
the company has invested million for the eight months ended december  to acquire healthcare related properties 
the properties purchased include two skilled nursing centers and eight personal care facilities 
one of the properties acquired was a skilled nursing facility purchased from vencor under the development agreement for million in the third quarter of the company does not currently intend to acquire any additional properties in available sources of capital to finance any future growth will include cash flows from operations  available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  the issuance of public or private debt or equity and asset sales  or a combination of the foregoing 
availability and terms of any such issuance will depend upon the market for such securities and other conditions at such time 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing or capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
the company may  under certain circumstances  borrow additional amounts in connection with the acquisition of additional properties  and as necessary to meet certain distribution requirements imposed on reits under the code 
to the extent the company uses equity as consideration for future acquisitions  the company will not require additional liquidity to finance such acquisitions 
the company does not currently intend to acquire any additional properties in year readiness disclosure the company the year yk issue is a result of computer programs and embedded computer chips using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
without corrective action  computer programs and embedded chips potentially could recognize the date ending in as the year or some other year rather than  causing many computer applications to fail or to create erroneous results 
the company s information technology systems it and non it systems such as building infrastructure components eg  elevators  alarm systems  electrical systems and other systems are affected by the yk issue 
during  the company outsourced all of its information systems support to vencor under its transition services agreement which terminated on december  after december   vencor continued to provide the company with certain administrative and support services primarily computer systems  telephone networks  mail delivery and other office services 
effective march   the company moved to new office space and those services are no longer provided by vencor 
in january  the company purchased a new file server and is converting to a new financial information system platform that is yk compliant 
the company expects that the conversion should be completed during the first quarter of the company also may be required to replace its computer hardware with new equipment that is yk compliant 
the company has received certification from all of its significant software and operating systems vendors that the versions of their products currently being installed are yk compliant 
the company has not and does not anticipate independently verifying such compliance 
the company estimates that the total cost it will incur to install a new server  financial system platform and update its computer hardware is less than  the company also has yk exposure in non it applications with respect to its real estate properties 
computer technology employed in elevators  alarm systems  electrical systems  built in healthcare systems and similar applications involved in the operations of the company s properties may cause interruptions of service with respect to those properties 
under the terms of the master leases  vencor is responsible for upgrading all building infrastructure components to be yk compliant 
as of december   vencor advised the company that it has tested and verified as yk compliant approximately of the facility components 
vencor has indicated to the company that it does not expect any material yk issues with respect to the company s facility components 
consequently  the company does not expect that its costs for yk remediation of its building infrastructure components will be material 
however  there can be no assurance that vencor s estimate with respect to estimated costs of remediation is accurate 
in addition  there can be no assurance that vencor will continue to honor its obligations under the master leases to upgrade all building components to be yk compliant or that vencor will have sufficient assets  income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy such obligations 
the most reasonably likely worse case scenario for the company associated with the yk issue is the risk of significant disruptions of vencor s business resulting from either i vencor s failure to upgrade all building infrastructure components to be yk compliant or ii the failure of vencor s significant third party payors  business partners  suppliers and vendors to be fully yk compliant 
failures of critical utility systems could also lead to significant business disruptions for vencor 
these occurrences could negatively impact vencor s ability to operate the company s properties and or make rental payments under the master leases thereby negatively impacting the company s liquidity and results of operations 
the yk issues facing vencor and vencor s yk compliance program are discussed below under year readiness disclosure vencor 
to date  the company has not established any contingency plan for the yk issue 
because the company s most significant risks associated with the yk issue relate to significant disruptions of vencor s business  the company anticipates developing contingency plans during  as is appropriate  based upon its continuing assessment of vencor s progress in implementing its yk compliance program and developing its own contingency plans 
the company s analysis of the yk issues affecting the company is based on information currently available and information provided from third party vendors and suppliers 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to yk compliance  there can be no assurance that the company has accurately or timely assessed all yk issues or that the estimated costs to remediate the yk issues will not be exceeded 
while the company believes it has substantially completed its assessment of all yk issues  its estimate of the costs to address such issues may change as it proceeds with the remediation and implementation of its new financial systems 
the company s ability to identify and remediate critical yk issues and the availability and cost of external resources will impact the company s total yk costs and the impact of yk on the company s results of operations 
year readiness disclosure vencor as a result of the company s dependence upon vencor as its primary tenant  the company may also be impacted negatively by yk issues facing vencor 
if vencor is unable to meet its yk compliance schedules or incurs costs substantially higher than its current expectations  vencor s ability to operate the properties and or make rental payments under the master leases could be impaired thereby impacting negatively the company s liquidity and results of operations 
the following discussion briefly describes the yk program instituted by vencor 
the information contained in this section was provided to the company by vencor 
the company is not the source of this information  has not verified independently the activities of vencor  and there can be no assurance that vencor has provided the company with complete and accurate information in all instances 
the company is in contact with vencor to monitor its progress 
in response to the yk issue  vencor established five teams to address yk issues in the following specific areas i it software and hardware  ii third party relationships  iii facility components  iv medical equipment  and v telephone systems 
each team is responsible for all phases of vencor s yk compliance program for both it and non it systems in its designated area 
vencor s yk compliance program consists of five phases i business assessment  ii inventory and assessment  iii remediation and testing  iv implementation and rollout  and v post implementation 
the business assessment phase identified potential yk issues confronting vencor 
the inventory and assessment phase consisted of a company wide assessment of all facility systems and components  medical devices  and it software and hardware 
during the remediation and testing phase  vencor is repairing  upgrading or replacing any non compliant it and non it systems 
additionally  vencor is performing verification and validation testing of it and non it systems that have been remediated and those vencor believes are yk compliant 
for it and non it systems that are internally developed  vencor verifies compliance status directly with the development staff and performs validation testing to confirm its status 
for it and non it systems that are purchased from outside vendors  vencor is requesting written assurances of compliance directly from the vendors 
when non compliant systems are identified  vencor will either replace  upgrade or remediate the system 
the implementation and rollout phase involves the installation of the new financial information and patient accounting systems and any it or non it systems that have been remediated and tested to vencor s corporate office and its facilities 
the final phase  post implementation  involves finalizing the documentation of the yk program and any corrective efforts surrounding date issues associated with the year being a leap year 
vencor has indicated that it has employed and will continue to employ external consultants to assist it through each of the phases 
vencor derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
vencor relies on these entities for accurate and timely reimbursement of claims  often through the use of electronic data interfaces 
vencor has indicated that it believes that while many commercial insurance carriers will be yk compliant  federal and state agencies are more likely to have system failures caused by yk issues 
vencor is contacting all of its significant reimbursement sources to determine their yk compliance status in order to make a determination of this potential risk 
vencor has not received assurance that systems used by medicare and medicaid will be yk compliant 
the failure of information systems of federal and state governmental agencies and other third party payors could have a material adverse effect on vencor s liquidity and financial condition  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
vencor also has initiated communications with its critical suppliers and vendors 
vencor is evaluating information provided by third party vendors and is conducting limited independent testing of critical systems and applications 
in most cases  vencor is relying on information being provided to it by such third parties 
while vencor is attempting to evaluate the information provided  there can be no assurance that in all instances accurate information is being provided 
if third party suppliers and vendors fail to respond to vencor s request for information  vencor may seek to procure other sources of supplies 
although vencor is assessing the readiness of the medicare and medicaid programs and other third party payers and preparing contingency plans  there can be no guarantee that the failure of these third parties to remediate their systems to be yk compliant will not have a material adverse effect on vencor  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the company s exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
the company earns revenue by leasing its assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s debt obligations are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related cash flows vary with the movement in libor 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the general fixed nature of the company s assets and the variable nature of the company s debt obligations creates interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  the company s lease revenue might not be sufficient to meet its debt obligations 
in order to mitigate this risk  at or about the date the company spun off its healthcare operations under the reorganization  it also entered into interest rate swaps to convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount 
as of december   the company had million of interest rate swaps outstanding with a highly rated counterparty in which the company pays a fixed rate of and receives libor from the counterparty 
when interest rates rise the interest rate swap agreement increases in market value to the company and when interest rates fall the interest rate swap agreement declines in value to the company 
since the interest rate swap agreement was executed  interest rates have generally been lower and the market value of the interest rate swap agreement has been an unrealized loss to the company 
as of december   the interest rate swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position to the company of approximately million 
to highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swap agreement to changes in interest rates the following summary shows the effects of an instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  market value to the company market value reflecting change in interest rates to the company at notional amount december  bps bps the terms of this interest rate swap agreement require that the company make a cash payment or otherwise post collateral  such as a letter of credit from one of the banks identified in the bank credit agreement to the counterparty if the market value loss to the company exceed certain levels the threshold levels 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the threshold levels vary based on the relationship between the company s debt obligations and the tangible fair market value of its assets as defined in the bank credit agreement 
as of december   the threshold level under the interest rate swap agreement was a market value loss of million and the interest rate swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position to the company of million 
under the interest rate swap agreement  if collateral must be posted  the principal amount of such collateral must equal the difference between the market value of the interest rate swap at the time of such determination and the threshold amount
