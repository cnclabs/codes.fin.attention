the company also offers a line of valve and valve automation products within the pipe  valve and fittings category and is seeking to expand its presence in this area 
the company offers its customers a single source of integrated services and supply on an efficient and competitive basis by being a first tier distributor which purchases its products directly from the manufacturer 
the company also provides integrated services such as system design  fabrication  installation  repair and maintenance for its customers 
the company offers a wide range of industrial mro products  equipment and services through a complete continuum of customized and efficient mro solutions  ranging from traditional distribution to fully integrated supply contracts 
the integrated solution is tailored to satisfy the customer s unique needs 
the company s products and services are marketed in states to over  customers that are engaged in a variety of industries  many of which may be counter cyclical to each other 
demand for the company s products generally is subject to changes in the united states economy and economic trends affecting the company s customers and the industries in which they compete in particular 
certain of these industries  such as the oil and gas industry  are subject to volatility while others  such as the petrochemical industry  are cyclical and materially affected by changes in the economy 
as a result  the company may within particular markets and product categories experience changes in demand as changes occur in the markets of its customers 
the company s strategy is focused on addressing current trends in the industrial distribution market through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth 
the company seeks acquisitions that will provide the company access to additional product lines and customers to enhance its position as a single source industrial distributor with first tier distribution capabilities 
key elements of the company s internal growth strategy include leveraging existing customer relationships  expanding product offerings from existing locations  reducing costs through consolidated purchasing programs and combined product distribution centers  designing and implementing innovative solutions to address the procurement and supply needs of the company s customers and using the company s traditional distribution and integrated supply capabilities to increase sales in each area 
future results for the company will be dependent on the success of the company in implementing its acquisition and internal growth strategy 
the ability of the company to implement its acquisition and internal growth strategy will be dependent on its ability to identify  consummate and assimilate acquisitions on economically favorable terms  to acquire and successfully integrate new product lines and to successfully market alternate forms of supply arrangements through the company s smartsource program 
although the company is actively seeking acquisitions and integrated supply arrangements that would meet its strategic objectives  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts

if the company were to issue shares of its capital stock in any acquisition  such issuance could be dilutive to existing shareholders

the company will continue communicating with customers  major vendors and other third parties with whom the company has material relationships to determine if they will be ready for the year by the end of although the most likely worst case scenario faced by the company would require the company to carry additional inventory levels to mitigate vendor complications  to the extent the company s customers  vendors and other third parties are not compliant by the year and unexpected complications result therefrom  it could have a material adverse effect upon the company s results of operations and financial condition 
with respect to phase  the company currently expects that its software will be year compliant by the end of the third quarter of the upgrading of the company s software to address year issues is being handled through new releases of current software 
costs incurred to date relative to this conversion have been minimal and are expected to continue to be minimal in future periods 
the company will continue to analyze systems and services that utilize date embedded codes that may experience operational problems when the year is reached 
the company expects to begin phase in the second quarter of all costs associated with year issues will be included as part of normal software upgrades or operating costs  as appropriate
