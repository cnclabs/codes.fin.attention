item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosures regarding forward looking statements this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including  without limitation  statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under business product strategy  business distribution  and notes to consolidated financial statements located elsewhere herein regarding the company s financial position  business strategy  plans and objectives of management of the company for future operations  and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the following significant factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause such results during fiscal  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company o the company faces intense competition based on product capabilities and experiences ever increasing demands from its actual and prospective customers for its products to be compatible with a variety of rapidly proliferating computing  telephony and computer networking technologies and standards 
the ultimate success of the company s products is dependent  to a large degree  on the company allocating its resources to developing and improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by the company s actual and prospective customers 
the company s success is also dependent  to a large degree  on the company s ability to implement arrangements with other vendors with complementary product offerings to provide actual and prospective customers greater functionality and to ensure that the company s products are compatible with the increased variety of technologies and standards 
o continued availability of suitable non proprietary computing platforms and system operating software that are compatible with the company s products 
o certain of the components for the company s products are available from limited suppliers 
the company s operating results could be adversely affected if the company were unable to obtain such components in the future 
o increasing litigation with respect to the enforcement of patents  copyrights and other intellectual property 
o the ability of the company to retain its customer base and  in particular  its more significant customers such as siemens ag  an intervoice distributor  which accounted for over ten percent of the company s total sales during fiscal since such customers generally are not contractually obligated to place further orders with the company 
o legislative and administrative changes and  in particular  changes affecting the telecommunications industry  such as the telecommunications act of while many industry analysts expect the telecommunications act of ultimately to result in at least a temporary surge in the procurement of telecommunications equipment and related software and other products  there is no assurance that the company can estimate with sufficient accuracy those products which will ultimately be purchased  the timing of any such purchases or the quantities to be purchased 
o risks involved in the company s international distribution and sales of its products  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  unexpected changes in exchange rates  the difficulty and expense of maintaining foreign offices and distribution channels  tariffs and other barriers to trade  difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights  and foreign governmental regulations that may limit or restrict the sales of call automation systems 
additionally  changes in foreign credit markets and currency exchange rates may result in requests by many international customers for extended payment terms and may have an adverse impact on the company s cash flow and its level of accounts receivable 
o the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any fiscal quarter  which can cause wide variations in the company s sales and earnings on a quarter to quarter basis 
o ability of the company to properly estimate costs under fixed price contracts in developing application software and otherwise tailoring its systems to customer specific requests 
o the company s ability to hire and retain  within the company s compensation parameters  qualified technical talent and outside contractors in highly competitive markets for the services of such personnel 
o mergers and acquisitions between companies in the telecommunications and financial industries which could result in fewer companies purchasing the company s products for telecommunications and banking applications  and or delay such purchases by companies that are in the process of reviewing their strategic alternatives in light of a merger or acquisition 
o extreme price and volume trading volatility in the us stock market  which has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies  frequently for reasons other than the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
results of operations the following table presents certain items as a percentage of sales for the company s last three fiscal years 
year ended february sales cost of goods sold gross margin research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses non recurring expenses operating income loss other income net

had it not been impacted by adoption of sop  tightened credit practices  non recurring expense items and a charge for in process research and development  cost of goods sold  gross margin  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  operating income and net income as a percentage of sales would have been    and  respectively 
impacted by a non recurring charge totaling approximately million million net of tax resulting from litigation settlement 
without this charge  operating income and net income for fiscal would have been and of sales  respectively 
sales sales are derived primarily from the shipment of call automation systems to both new and existing customers in two major market categories customer premises equipment cpe and telecommunications telco 
due to customer demand  many of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the size and timing of some transactions have historically resulted in sales fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
in the past  the impact of these fluctuations has been mitigated to some extent by vertical markets and by the geographic location of the company s existing and prospective customers 
however  the company has become more prone to quarterly sales fluctuations due to its sales to the worldwide telco market which are generally large in dollar amount and unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
effective december  the company adopted the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop 
prior to the adoption of sop  the company s policy provided for the recognition of revenue upon shipment  provided that the company s remaining obligations relating to system installation and testing were not significant 
with sop  contract accounting was adopted for systems that require company customization and installation 
revenue for contracts for large systems  generally greater than  in sales value  is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenue for smaller systems is recognized on the completed contract method  ie  when all the company s obligations have been met 
the requirements of sop only apply to sales which require customization and or installation by the company  and such sales have historically accounted for approximately of the company s aggregate annual sales 
the adoption of sop resulted in the company not recognizing revenue in the same fiscal quarter that certain systems are shipped 
the adoption of sop also resulted in the company recognizing revenue during a fiscal quarter from systems shipped in previous fiscal periods 
accordingly  the adoption of sop delayed by to days the company s recognition of approximately million in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the first fiscal quarter of adoption 
the adoption of sop did not result in a material increase or decrease in the company s aggregate sales during its fiscal from time to time  the company has agreed to amend customer purchase orders to extend normal payment terms in exchange for accelerating delivery and installation of systems  particularly systems not requiring customization 
the company tightened this practice in its fourth quarter of fiscal to improve cash flow 
this decision resulted in an approximate million decrease to revenues during the quarter and fiscal year 
the company continued its tightened practices during its fiscal worldwide sales in fiscal increased  declined in fiscal and increased in fiscal worldwide cpe sales increased in fiscal  decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal year worldwide telco sales increased in fiscal and declined and in fiscal and cpe sales constituted  and of the company s total sales in fiscal years  and  respectively  while telco sales made up  and of the company s total sales during the same time periods 
system maintenance contracts now cover  end users and sales of such contracts comprised  and of the company s total sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
domestic cpe sales in fiscal  and increased  and  respectively  due to the company s continued investment in the expansion of its distribution channels and marketing and advertisement programs and in the hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel 
international cpe sales in fiscal increased  decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal decreased international sales in fiscal resulted from a poor pacific rim economic environment and a concentration of the company s sales efforts in latin america on telecommunications opportunities 
international sales increased in fiscal and for the same reasons as the increase in domestic cpe sales 
international cpe sales constituted of the company s total cpe sales in fiscal years and and of such sales in fiscal telco sales increased in fiscal as a result of the hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel and of the expansion of marketing programs 
the company believes the decline in worldwide telco sales during fiscal and was attributable to a soft domestic telecommunications market 
the company believes the market softness was attributable  in part  particularly during fiscal  to temporary delays by some telecommunications companies in implementing call automation solutions while they evaluated marketing and investment strategies in light of new opportunities resulting from deregulation under the telecommunications act of and judicial proceedings relating to certain provisions of the act 
international telco sales constituted  and of the company s total telco sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
prices for the company s products have remained stable  as measured by price per line shipped  during fiscal  and although the features and functions per line shipped have become more robust 
the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is minimal as less than of total sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
cost of goods sold fiscal cost of goods sold was of total sales  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was the result of increased sales and the company s efforts to control costs and expenses 
the increase in cost of goods sold during fiscal was the result of the company s continued investment in applications engineering and customer service resources to pursue opportunities in all of its markets despite lower than anticipated sales 
research and development fiscal  and research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal expenses included porting the company s intersoft run time software to the unix and windows nt operating systems  developing computer platform independent voice automation hardware and software  the development of the nsp platform  augmenting the company s speech recognition and voice verification capabilities  and the integration into the company s product offerings of the esp product line purchased from integrated telephony products  inc and the computer telephony software suite purchased from dronen consulting  incorporated 
additionally  expenditures were made in fiscal  and for the ongoing development of the company s onevoice systems the company s call automation system  agentconnect the company s customer relationship management system  onelink a digital interface for analog switches  and digital vocalcard software and hardware functionality 
research and development expenses in fiscal and also reflect the development of computer platform independent hardware and software  a voice mail system  speech recognition in both alpha and numeric format including continuous speech  voice verification  a facsimile server  vertical industry application packages including applications targeted for the telecommunications industry  enhancements to the telecommunications products obtained from the company s acquisition of the voiceplex corporation in the company s fiscal  and international homologations the approvals required for connectivity to the telephone network in numerous international markets 
the company has not capitalized internal hardware or software development expenses 
the company expects that in fiscal it will maintain its strong commitment to research and development to remain at the forefront of technology development in its business segment  which is essential to improving the company s position in the industry 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal such expenses were million in fiscal during fiscal the company undertook measures to control expenses  particularly selling  general and administrative expenses see discussion below in income loss from operations 
during fiscal and  the company continued to hire and train new and existing sales  service and support personnel and expand its marketing and advertising programs worldwide  despite lower than anticipated sales 
other income and expense other expense during fiscal was primarily interest paid on the company s borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
other income during fiscal and was primarily interest income on cash and short term investments 
the increase in other income in fiscal versus fiscal reflected the company s increased average cash balances 
income loss from operations the company generated operating income of million and net income of million  respectively  in fiscal the company incurred an operating loss and a net loss during fiscal of million and million  respectively 
the company generated operating income of million and net income of million in fiscal year in order to understand the company s operating and net income over the last three fiscal years  it must be noted that the company  during fiscal  incurred non recurring charges of approximately million including the following million associated with certain personnel matters  including the resignation of the company s former president and chief operating officer  and million to write off certain intangible assets as a result of the company s re examination of its product development and infrastructure requirements 
the company also provided million for potential inventory obsolescence in light of efforts to migrate customers to its internally developed nsp computing platform from the company s traditional computing platforms such as ibm ps computers 
as a result of such migration  the company reviewed its on hand supply of traditional computer platforms and determined that a provision for obsolescence was necessary to allow for a potential excess supply of traditional computer platforms of which the company had approximately million on hand at february  additionally  the company wrote off as in process research and development approximately million of the purchase price paid to integrated telephony products  inc for its esp product line 
in addition to acquiring the esp product line and certain other assets of integrated telephony products  inc the company acquired two in process research and development projects call flow and internet telephony interfaces 
call flow is a project to develop a windows nt  gui based telecommunications application development tool 
internet telephony interfaces is a project to develop interfaces to allow text and voice messaging over the internet which will enable an end user to access voice messages  text messages such as email and faxes either through traditional telecommunications networks with text messages and faxes being read to the end user using text to speech technology or through the internet 
the amount allocated to the purchased research and development projects million was expensed at the time of acquisition as the company determined that the purchased research and development projects had not reached technological feasibility based on the status of design and development activities that required further refinement and testing 
to determine the fair market value of the in process research and development projects  the company used a risk adjusted income approach  whereupon fair market value is a function of the future revenues expected to be generated by an asset  net of all allocable expenses 
in determining the amount of the purchase price to allocate to the purchased research and development  factors such as stage of completion and technological uncertainties were considered by the company in determining the present value of the future benefits to be received 
the development activities required to complete the acquired in process research and development projects include additional coding  cross platform porting and validation  quality assurance procedures and beta testing 
at the time of purchase  the estimated future cost of completing these activities was expected to be approximately million to be incurred over the next months 
actual costs incurred during fiscal were approximately million 
revenue streams from the resulting products are expected to begin in fiscal and were projected forward for five years in the risk adjusted income analysis 
a discount rate of was used to determine the present value of the cash flows related to the in process research and development projects which resulted in million of assigned value 
if these projects do not meet with the company s anticipated level of market acceptance  the company may not realize the value assigned to the purchased research and development 
also impacting operating income in fiscal was the company s adoption of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop and a tightening of the company s credit practices to improve cash flow 
see item sales 
the company incurred a one time charge of approximately million in connection with the settlement of certain litigation during fiscal adjusting for the one time charges and other items discussed above  the company would have generated operating income of approximately million and approximately million in fiscal and  respectively  and net income of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal operating income increased over fourteen times versus adjusted operating income in fiscal as the result of increased sales and the company s measures to control costs and expenses  particularly selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income  adjusted for the one time charges and other items discussed above  in fiscal and fiscal decreased and  respectively  versus the previous fiscal year as the company increased its investment in sales  marketing  application engineering  and research and development resources without a corresponding increase in the company s sales 
these investments were made to continue to pursue opportunities in the cpe and telco markets 
fiscal net income increased nearly ten times versus adjusted net income in the previous fiscal year  and net income  adjusted for the one time charges and other items discussed above  in fiscal and fiscal decreased and  respectively  versus the previous fiscal year for the same reasons as operating income 
liquidity and capital resources the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at february   while borrowings under the company s credit facilities was million 
investment activities consisting of the acquisition and purchase of fixed assets and third party software and financing activities consisting primarily of the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock together used approximately million 
net income plus non cash expense items totaled million while an increase in operating assets totaled million to yield an operating cash flow of million during fiscal the increase in operating assets was primarily attributable to a million increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to increased sales and a few large contracts with payment terms which extend beyond the dates on which revenue is recognized for financial reporting purposes 
investment activities totaling approximately million during and included the purchase of a computer telephony software suite from dronen consulting  incorporated for million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock  valued at million 
other purchases included computing hardware and software to update the company s enterprise systems and to provide the information systems infrastructure needed to support the company s worldwide growth 
expenditures were also made to acquire third party developed software to be integrated into the company s intersoft software to allow the company to offer its customers greater functionality and to ensure the company s products comply with an increasing variety of hardware and software technologies and standards 
financing activities during fiscal included the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock  at a cost of approximately million pursuant to an authorization by its board of directors during fiscal the company believes that market conditions made such share repurchases of value to its shareholders 
other financing activities included the receipt of million as proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the pay down of million on the company s borrowings 
as a result of cash generated from operations and investment and financing activities  the company experienced an increase of its cash reserves of approximately million during fiscal the company believes that its cash reserves and internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company reviews share repurchase and acquisition opportunities from time to time and believes it has access to the financial resources necessary to pursue attractive opportunities as they arise 
the company also believes it has access to other financial resources to pursue any investment opportunities or financing requirements that might arise in the foreseeable future 
the company has negotiated a million credit facility with bank of america which is scheduled to expire on november  the company completed a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend on january  basic and diluted earnings per share have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split 
on april   the company signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of brite voice systems  inc brite 
pursuant to the agreement  intervoice will pay brite shareholders per brite share  or based on approximately million shares of brite common stock outstanding  total consideration of approximately million 
of this total  approximately million  or per brite share  will be in cash and approximately million  or per brite share  will be in shares of intervoice common stock 
the merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination 
the transaction will be executed in two steps  the first being an all cash tender offer at per share for approximately million shares of brite s common stock 
the second step will consist of a merger in which shares of brite common stock not purchased in the cash tender offer will be exchanged into shares of intervoice common stock 
the ratio of exchange will be determined at the time of the merger based on the average closing price of an intervoice share for the preceding twenty five trading days 
this transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of brite and intervoice 
the cash tender offer will close on june  the closing of the transaction is subject to certain customary conditions as described in the merger agreement 
in connection with this transaction  intervoice has received a commitment from bank of america to provide senior secured credit facilities amounting to million  which will include a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit agreement 
the term loan agreement will be subject to scheduled repayments  as defined  during the revolving credit agreement will expire upon the earlier of the termination of the term loan  or august  if the tender offer and merger are consummated and the debt facilities are funded  the cash required to service the facilities could have a material impact upon the operating cash requirements of the company for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation the company does not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on its financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries 
further  the company presently is not bound by long term fixed price sales contracts and has no material long term debt obligations  which should reduce the company s exposure to inflationary effects 
if the tender offer and subsequent merger with brite is consummated see item business tender offer for brite voice systems  inc  the debt facilities financing the transaction would be considered to be a material long term debt obligation  which may expose the company to inflationary effects associated with such variable rate loans 
quarterly results of operations unaudited three months ended fiscal may aug nov feb sales     income from operations     net income     net income per share diluted 



three months ended fiscal may aug nov feb sales     income loss from operations     net income loss     net income loss per share diluted 


includes the impact of the adoption of sop  tightened credit practices  non recurring expense items  and a charge for in process research and development see discussion of fiscal in item g  selected financial data 
without these items  sales for the quarter ended february  would have been approximately million and earnings would have been per diluted share 
year compliance many installed computer systems used by numerous companies to run a variety of applications are not capable of processing date sensitive information that falls beyond the twentieth century 
unless these computer systems are replaced or upgraded prior to the year to process such date sensitive information  the systems may experience severe operating difficulties or system failures 
beginning in fiscal  the company initiated a program to replace and upgrade its information systems to accommodate the company s growth  improve productivity and remediate any century compliance problems 
this program should be substantially completed by july additionally  the company has created a year project team to review and test its information technology systems and non information technology systems and to resolve any century compliance issues that are found 
the team also is attempting to ensure that any replacements and upgrades to the company s systems are century compliant before they are implemented 
in this regard  the team is continuing to work with third party vendors to assess the year readiness of its technology systems 
the year readiness of the company s technology systems is  therefore  partially dependent upon the accuracy of disclosures and representations made by third party vendors  such as oracle  peoplesoft  microsoft  ibm and dell computer 
the company anticipates that its testing and remediation program for year issues with respect to mission critical systems should be substantially completed by august because most of the expenditures to replace and upgrade the company s internal systems have been made and will be incurred in the ordinary course of business  ie  on a non accelerated basis  the company does not anticipate that it will incur material incremental expenses in connection with its year remedial efforts 
as a result of the program to replace and upgrade its internal systems  and the efforts of the year project team  the company believes that its internal systems will be century compliant prior to the year however  there is no assurance that the company will identify and resolve any and all century compliance problems with its internal systems in a timely manner  that the expenses associated with such remedial efforts will not be significant  or that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has created a detailed year testing program for its mission critical systems 
systems which perform certain mission critical customer service applications are currently undergoing extensive century compliance testing 
the remaining mission critical systems and applications are scheduled for century compliance testing during the company s second fiscal quarter ending august  the commencement of the company s fiscal year on march  helped to accelerate its year testing program  particularly for mission critical financial  manufacturing and order entry applications which process dates that reflect the fiscal year end date ie  february  
in addition to assessing and testing internal business systems for year readiness issues  the company is also in the process of reviewing its other contingency plans for system failures that might arise in connection with the millennium transition 
the company currently has certain disaster recovery processes and procedures designed to allow it to continue critical business operations in the event of a software or hardware failure  or the failure of infrastructure services ie  electricity  telephone services  water transport  internet services  etc these disaster recovery processes and procedures generally involve manual work arounds and alternate computerized solutions 
the company is in the process of reviewing the adequacy of these processes and procedures in light of potential century compliance issues 
while the company does not currently have a full contingency plan for system failures that may occur in connection with the year  the company believes that a satisfactory contingency plan can be developed based  in part  on existing disaster recovery programs 
to assist with the development of a full contingency plan  the company is in the process of engaging a disaster recovery service company 
as part of the contingency plan  the company will acquire an auxiliary power generator to help operate mission critical systems in the event of temporary power failures 
based on a thorough review and testing of its software products and other products  the company believes that its current products are century compliant 
the company began designating certain products as such in june the company s assessment of its current products is partially dependent upon the accuracy of disclosures and representations concerning century compliance made by its suppliers  such as microsoft  ibm and dell computer 
however  many of the company s customers are using earlier versions of the company s software products and other products that may not be century compliant 
the company has instituted programs to actively warn these customers of the risks associated with using software and other products which may not be century compliant  and to actively encourage such customers to migrate to the company s current products 
the company s products are generally integrated with a customer s enterprise system  which involves software products developed by other vendors 
a customer may mistakenly believe that century compliance problems with its enterprise system are attributable to products provided by the company 
the company may in the future be subject to claims based on century compliance issues related to a customer s enterprise system or other products provided by third parties  custom modifications to the company s products made by third parties  the company s earlier products which may not be completely century compliant  the company s performance and warranty obligations under customer contracts  or issues arising from the customer s unique application or the integration of the company s products with other products 
the company has not been a party to any proceeding involving its products or services in connection with century compliance issues  however  there is no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services in such proceedings against claims of century compliance issues  and any resulting liability of the company for damages could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
based on recent discussions with current and potential customers  the company believes that the timing of purchases and implementations of call processing systems may be influenced by year readiness issues 
year readiness issues might encourage some customers to purchase new call processing systems  or upgrades to existing systems  in order to ensure that they have century compliant current systems 
on the other hand  some customers may have to spend significant amounts to remedy year readiness issues with their internal computer systems not related to their call processing systems 
these expenditures could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of other computerized systems  such as call processing systems 
some customers may also choose to delay the implementation or purchase of new or upgraded computer systems  including call processing systems  in order to stabilize their internal operations and reduce the risk of introducing new year issues 
accordingly  the company believes that year issues may simultaneously encourage certain customers to purchase call processing systems prior to the year  and may cause other customers to delay their purchases of call processing systems 
if year concerns lead to a net reduction in the company s revenues  such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  the company s current credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on either a prime rate or the london interbank offering rate 
the company had million outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement at the end of fiscal the company currently believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
in the event that the tender offer and subsequent merger with brite is consummated see item business merger with brite voice systems  inc and related financing  both the term facility of million and the revolving credit facility of million will bear interest at variable interest rates based on either a prime rate  the federal funds rate or the london interbank offering rate  plus an applicable margin 
due to the magnitude of this proposed facility  the company believes that the effect of any reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows may be material
