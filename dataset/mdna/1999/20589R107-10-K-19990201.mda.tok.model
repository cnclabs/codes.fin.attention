factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled factors affecting operating results commencing on page the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview the company was founded in from to mid  the company conducted development and network services planning activities and realized no revenues 
initially  the company was focused on providing consumers with direct dial up connectivity to bulletin board services 
online gaming and entertainment services for consumers were commenced in july through the utilization of a third party network infrastructure 
the company commenced operation of its own network in late in may  new management led by henry r 
nothhaft redefined and broadened the company s strategy to provide a range of internet and tailored  value added internet protocol based network services to consumers and businesses 
the company s revenue prior to was primarily generated from providing internet access to consumers 
the company s current focus is on developing and deploying vpns and providing dedicated network access and web hosting services for enterprise customers 
contracts with enterprise customers typically have a term ranging from one to three years 
the company expects enterprise related revenue to represent an increasing portion of total revenue in future periods 
the foregoing expectation is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors including the company s operating results  the results and timing of the company s launch of new products and services  governmental or regulatory changes  the ability of the company to meet product and project demands  the success of the company s marketing efforts  competition and acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies or products 
in february  the company acquired internex  a provider of network services  collocation services and web hosting facilities to enterprise customers 
this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements do not include results of operations  financial position or cash flows of internex prior to its acquisition in february in addition  as a result of the acquisition  the company incurred a charge of million relating to acquired in process technology and recorded an aggregate of million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which will be amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to five years 
in may  the company acquired deltanet  a provider of dial up and dedicated access services  web hosting services and web application development and design 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
results of deltanet s operations for the period beginning april  through december  are included in the consolidated results of operations 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition  the company has incurred charges of approximately million in transaction costs consisting primarily of severance costs  redundant facilities and assets and professional fees related to the acquisition 
in august  the company acquired anaserve  a provider of web hosting services 
this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the company s historical financial statements do not include results of operations  financial position or cash flows of anaserve prior to its acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  the company has recorded an aggregate of million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which will be amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives ranging from one to five years 
the company may acquire other complementary products  technology and businesses 
if the company were to incur additional charges for acquired in process technology  amortization of goodwill and acquisition costs with respect to any future acquisitions  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
see factors affecting operating results our acquisition strategy poses several risks and liquidity and capital resources 
the company has incurred net losses and experienced negative cash flow from operations since inception and expects to continue to operate at a net loss and experience negative cash flow at least through the remainder of the company s ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow from operations is dependent upon the company s ability to substantially grow its revenue base and achieve other operating efficiencies 
the company experienced net losses attributable to common stockholders of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we cannot assure you that the company will be able to achieve or sustain revenue growth  profitability or positive cash flow on either a quarterly or an annual basis 
at december   the company had approximately million of gross deferred tax assets comprised primarily of net operating loss carry forwards 
the company believes that  based on a number of factors  the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of the deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has been recorded 
these factors include the company s history of net losses since its inception and the fact that the market in which the company competes is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
the company believes that  based on the current available evidence  it is more likely than not that the company will not generate taxable income through  and possibly beyond  and accordingly will not realize the company s deferred tax assets through  and possibly beyond 
the company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on actual and forecasted operating results 
in addition  the utilization of net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
see factors affecting operating results we have a limited operating history and expect continuing operating losses 
the company expects to focus in the near term on building and increasing its revenue base  which will require it to significantly increase its expenses for personnel  marketing  network infrastructure and the development of new services  and may adversely impact short term operating results 
as a result  the company believes that it will incur losses in the near term and we cannot assure you that the company will be profitable in the future 
the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly  depending upon a variety of factors  including the timely deployment and expansion of the concentric network and new network architectures  the incurrence of related capital costs  variability and length of the sales cycle associated with the company s product and service offerings  the receipt of new value added network services and consumer services subscriptions and the introduction of new services by the company and its competitors 
additional factors that may contribute to variability of operating results include the pricing and mix of services offered by the company  customer retention rate  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s services  changes in pricing policies by the company s competitors  the company s ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components  user demand for network and internet access services  balancing of network usage over a hour period  the ability to manage potential growth and expansion  the ability to identify  acquire and integrate successfully suitable acquisition candidates  and charges related to acquisitions 
in response to competitive pressures  the company may take certain pricing or marketing actions that could have a material adverse affect on the company s business 
as a result  variations in the timing and amounts of revenues could have a material adverse affect on the company s quarterly operating results 
due to the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in the event that the company s operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of the company s common stock would likely decline

disclosures about market risk the following discusses the company s exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under the captions factors affecting operating results we have incurred substantial indebtedness and may not be able to service our debt and factors affecting operating results we may need additional capital in the future and such additional financing may not be available 
interest rate sensitivity 
short term investments owned by the company 
as of december   the company had short term investments of million 
these short term investments consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of between three and twelve months 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by percent from levels at december  would cause the fair value of these short term investments to decline by an immaterial amount 
the company has the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce the company s interest income 
outstanding debt of the company 
as of december   the company had outstanding long term debt of approximately million at a fixed interest rate of and million of preferred stock outstanding with a dividend rate of 
in certain circumstances  the company may redeem this preferred stock or exchange long term debt for this preferred stock 
because the interest and dividend rates on these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company 
increases in interest rates could  however  increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings by the company  if any 
the company does not hedge against interest rate increases 
equity price risk 
the company owns  shares of the common stock of covad 
the company purchased these shares at the time of covad s initial public offering in january at a price of per share 
on january   the closing price of covad s common stock was per share 
the company values this investment using the lower of cost or market method  and thus continues to value this investment at its cost of million 
if the price of covad common stock were to decline below per share and such decline was considered to be other than temporary  the company would be required to write down the value of this investment 
the company is generally restricted from selling these shares for at least one year from the date of their purchase 
the company does not hedge against equity price changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
all of the company s revenues are realized in dollars and substantially all of the company s revenues are from customers in the united states 
therefore  the company does not believe it has any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company does not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate changes 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
the company is currently in the process of reviewing its products and services  as well as its internal management information systems in order to identify and modify those products  services and systems that are not year compliant 
based on the company s assessment to date  the company has determined that its internally developed software  including much of its operational  financial and management information systems software is year compliant 
the company s operational  financial and management information systems software which have not been internally developed have been certified as year compliant by the third party vendors who have supplied the software 
the equipment and software that runs the company s data centers are supplied by microsoft  nortel bay networks and sun microsystems 
the company has implemented software patches supplied by microsoft so that the microsoft software in these data centers no longer contains any material year deficiencies 
the company implemented similar patches for the software supplied by sun microsystems at the end of and expects to replace the bay networks equipment and software by the end of march with versions which do not contain any material year deficiencies 
the company expects such modifications will be made on a timely basis and does not believe that the cost of such modifications will have a material effect on the company s operating results 
additionally  the company is continuing to assess the year compliance of its products and services 
to date  most newly introduced products and services of the company do not contain material year deficiencies  however some of the company s customers are running earlier product versions that are not year compliant 
the company has been encouraging such customers to migrate to current product versions 
the company estimates that the capital and other costs associated with the upgrade and conversion of its existing products  services and systems relating to the year issue will not be material 
the company does not separately track internal costs incurred to assess and remedy deficiencies related to the year problem  however  such costs are principally the payroll costs for its information systems group 
the company does not have and is not developing a contingency plan in the event its systems fail as a result of year related problems 
the company s products  services and systems operate in complex network environments and directly and indirectly interact with a number of other hardware and software systems 
the company faces risks to the extent that suppliers of products  services and systems purchased by the company and others with whom the company transacts business on a worldwide basis  including those which form significant portions of the company s network and may be sole or limited source suppliers  do not have business systems or products that comply with year requirements 
the company has not received significant assurances from its suppliers that their networks are year compliant 
if these networks fail  the company s business will be significantly impacted 
the company s expectation that it will be able to upgrade its products  services and systems to address the year issue and its expectation regarding the costs associated with these upgrades are forward looking statements subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may vary materially as a result of a number of factors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to timely and successfully modify such products  services and systems to comply with year requirements 
any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
furthermore  despite testing by the company and its vendors  the company s products  services and systems may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
in the event any material errors or defects are not detected and fixed or third parties cannot timely provide the company with products  services or systems that meet the year requirements  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
known or unknown errors or defects that affect the operation of the company s products  services or systems could result in delay or loss of revenue  interruption of network services  cancellation of customer contracts  diversion of development resources  damage to the company s reputation  and litigation costs 
there can be no assurance that these or other factors relating to year compliance issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
factors affecting operating results as described by the following factors  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
we have a limited operating history and expect continuing operating losses 
we were incorporated in  commenced network operations in and completed initial deployment of our current network architecture and use of an advanced atm backbone network in late accordingly  we have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be based 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
to address these risks  we must  among other things 
respond to competitive developments  
continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  and 
continue to upgrade our technologies and commercialize network services incorporating such technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing the risks we face 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred net losses and experienced negative cash flow from operations since inception 
we expect to continue to operate at a net loss and experience negative cash flow at least through our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow from operations is dependent upon our ability to substantially grow our revenue base and achieve other operating efficiencies 
we experienced net losses attributable to common stockholders of approximately million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or sustain revenue growth  profitability or positive cash flow on either a quarterly or an annual basis 
our estimates of the periods of time in which we expect to continue to operate at a net loss  experience negative cash flow and not generate taxable income are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in this factors affecting operating results section 
our operating results fluctuate and could decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
our operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  including the following 
timely deployment and expansion of our network and new network architectures  
the incurrence of capital costs related to network expansion  
variability and length of the sales cycle associated with our product and service offerings  
the receipt of new value added network services and consumer services subscriptions  
the introduction of new services by us and our competitors  
the pricing and mix of services offered by us  
our customer retention rate  
market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our services  
changes in pricing policies by our competitors  
our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components  
user demand for network and internet access services  
balancing of network usage over a hour period  
the ability to manage potential growth and expansion  
the ability to identify  acquire and successfully integrate suitable acquisition candidates  and 
charges related to acquisitions 
variations in the timing and amounts of revenues due to these actions could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our securities would likely decline 
the loss of any of our major customers could severely impact our business 
we currently derive a substantial portion of our total revenue from webtv 
revenue from webtv accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december   of our revenue for the year ended december  and of our revenue for the year ended december  webtv may terminate our current agreement at will after october  while we expect revenue from webtv to decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods  we believe that revenue derived from a limited number of customers may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
as a result  the loss of one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that revenue from customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  will continue  or will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
our growth and expansion may strain our resources 
our business and service offerings have grown rapidly since our inception 
the growth and expansion of our business and our service offerings have placed  and are expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
in addition  we recently expanded and upgraded our network to use an atm backbone 
we plan to continue to substantially expand our network in and future periods 
to manage our growth  we must  among other things 
continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  including our billing  accounts receivable and payable tracking  fixed assets and other financial management systems  
hire  train and retain qualified personnel  and 
continue to expand and upgrade our network infrastructure 
we are currently in the process of replacing and updating our operational  financial and management information systems 
the systems being replaced and updated include our billing  provisioning and other financial management systems 
we began to replace our information systems facilities in the fourth quarter of and these efforts will continue throughout we also consolidated our silicon valley operations in a new  larger facility in the fourth quarter of and will transfer our remaining silicon valley data centers to this facility during the first two quarters of management of the transition of our information systems and of the personnel and operational equipment to the new facility is expected to place additional strain on our resources 
we cannot assure you that this transition will be completed successfully or on a timely basis 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our network or add services at the rate or according to the schedule presently planned by us 
we had employees and independent contractors as of december   and have grown to employees and independent contractors as of december  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage this growth in personnel 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to hire  train and retain sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to meet our requirements 
our expanding customer base demands the rapid growth of our network infrastructure and technical support resources 
we may in the future experience difficulties meeting the demand for our access services and technical support 
we cannot assure you that our technical support or other resources will be sufficient to facilitate our growth 
we are striving to increase total network utilization and to optimize this utilization by targeting both business and consumer users to balance the network s usage throughout a hour period 
there will be additional demands on our customer support  sales and marketing resources as we pursue this utilization strategy 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our acquisition strategy poses several risks 
we have completed three acquisitions to date and may seek to acquire additional assets  technologies and businesses complementary to our operations 
the completed acquisitions are and any subsequent acquisitions would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in such transactions 
such risks include  among other things 
difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  
the additional financial resources that may be needed to fund the operations of acquired companies  
the potential disruption of our business  
our management s ability to maximize our financial and strategic position by the incorporation of acquired technology or businesses into our service offerings  
the difficulty of maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  
the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  
the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management  and 
the incurrence of significant expenses in consummating acquisitions 
any of the above risks could prevent us from realizing significant benefits from our acquisitions 
in addition  the issuance of our common stock in acquisitions will dilute our stockholder interests in our company  while the use of cash will deplete our cash reserves 
finally  if we are unable to account for our acquisitions under the pooling of interests method of accounting  we may incur significant  one time write offs and amortization charges 
these write offs and charges could decrease our future earnings or increase our future losses 
our future success depends upon third party distribution and engineering relationships 
an important element of our strategy is to develop relationships with leading companies to enhance our distribution and engineering efforts 
we have agreements with netscape and microsoft pursuant to which we distribute and modify their browsers 
our customization of browsers is an integral part of our current tailored vpn offerings 
the netscape agreement may be terminated at any time upon days notice and the microsoft agreement expires in march we are currently discussing with microsoft an extension of the term of our agreement  but we cannot assure you that these discussions will be successful 
we have an agreement with intuit for the development  operation and maintenance of a vpn that is the integrated access  dial up network and infrastructure used by purchasers of quicken  turbo tax and other intuit software products 
intuit customers use this vpn to access the quicken financial network website and the internet 
the intuit contract may be terminated at the election of intuit upon six months prior notice of an election to terminate 
we have also recently entered into strategic agreements with sbc and teligent for the delivery of private labeled services to their customers 
we rely on these relationships for the acquisition of enterprise and consumer customers 
our inability to capitalize on these agreements  the termination of or failure to renew any of these agreements or our inability to enter into similar relationships with others could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we have an outsourcing agreement with williams technology solutions  a subsidiary of williams communications group  inc  that enables us to use williams employees for the operational support of our network 
our use of williams employees and williams engineering expertise was integral to the development of our network and continue to be integral to the ongoing operation of our network operations center 
pursuant to the agreement with williams  all of the williams employees currently working for us will become our employees when the agreement terminates in december termination of any of these agreements or our failure to renew any of the agreements upon termination on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon new and uncertain markets 
we offer tailored  value added network services for enterprises and consumers  including internet access 
these markets are in the early stages of development 
it is difficult to predict the rate at which the market will grow  if at all  because these markets are relatively new and current and future competitors are likely to introduce competing services or products 
new or increased competition may result in market saturation 
certain critical issues concerning commercial use of tailored  value added services and internet services  remain unresolved and may impact the growth of such services 
these issues include  among others  security  reliability  ease and cost of access  and quality of service 
our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if the markets for our services  including internet access 
fail to grow  
grow more slowly than anticipated  or 
become saturated with competitors 
we depend upon new and enhanced services 
we have recently introduced new enterprise service offerings  including the introduction of value added  ip based communication services to enterprises and a new line of dsl services in limited areas 
the failure of these services to gain market acceptance in a timely manner or at all  or the failure of the dsl service in particular  to achieve significant market coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we introduce new or enhanced services with reliability  quality or compatibility problems  then market acceptance of such services could be significantly delayed or hindered 
such problems or delays could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and subscribers 
our new or enhanced services may have errors or defects 
our services may contain undetected errors or defects when new services or enhancements are first introduced 
we cannot assure you that  despite testing by us or our customers  errors will not be found in new services or enhancements after commencement of commercial deployment 
such errors could result in 
additional development costs  
loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  
diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  and 
the loss of customers and subscribers 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we need to balance network use to provide quality service 
if we do not achieve balanced network utilization over a hour period  our network could become overburdened at certain periods during the day  which could adversely affect our quality of service 
conversely  due to the high fixed cost nature of our infrastructure  under utilization of our network during certain periods of the day could adversely affect our ability to provide cost efficient services at other times 
any failure to achieve balanced network utilization could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon our suppliers and have sole and limited sources of supply for certain products and services 
we rely on other companies to supply certain key components of our network infrastructure 
these components include critical telecommunications services and networking equipment  which  in the quantities and quality demanded by us  are available only from sole or limited sources 
at t corp  mci worldcom  inc  pacwest telecomm  inc 
and williams are our primary providers of data communications facilities and capacity 
at t is currently the sole provider of the frame relay backbone of our network 
mci worldcom and williams are currently the providers of the atm backbone of our network 
we are also dependent upon lecs to provide telecommunications services to us and our customers 
we experience delays from time to time in receiving telecommunications services from these suppliers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such services on the scale and within the time frames required by us at an affordable cost  or at all 
any failure to obtain such services on a sufficient scale  on a timely basis or at an affordable cost would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we purchase our nortel bay  cisco systems  netopia  lucent technologies  sun microsystems and other vendor equipment either directly from the manufacturer or via systems integrators including milgo solutions  inc and williams 
some of these vendors are sole source suppliers 
we purchase these components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time with our suppliers 
we do not carry significant inventories of these components and have no guaranteed supply arrangements for such components 
our suppliers also sell products to our competitors and may in the future themselves become our competitors 
we cannot assure you that our suppliers will not enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices  or at all 
the expansion of our network infrastructure is placing  and will continue to place  a significant demand on our suppliers 
some of these suppliers have limited resources and production capacity 
in addition  some of our suppliers rely on sole or limited sources of supply for components included in their products 
failure of our suppliers to meet increasing demand may prevent them from continuing to supply components and products in the quantities and quality and at the times required by us  or at all 
our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of sole or limited source components or to develop alternative sources  if required  could result in delays and increased costs in expanding  and overburdening of  our network infrastructure 
any such delay  increased costs or overburdening would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also depend on our suppliers ability to provide necessary products and components that comply with various internet and telecommunications standards 
these products and components must also interoperate with products and components from other vendors 
any failure of our suppliers to provide products or components that comply with internet standards or that interoperate with other products or components used by us in our network infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our suppliers  including the rbocs and other lecs  currently are subject to tariff controls and other price constraints that in the future may be changed 
in addition  regulatory proposals are pending that may affect what the rbocs and other lecs charge us 
any such regulatory changes could result in increased prices of products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon our network infrastructure 
our success depends upon the capacity  reliability and security of our network infrastructure 
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from customer subscriptions 
we expect that a substantial portion of our future revenue will be derived from the provision of tailored  value added network services to our enterprise customers 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network infrastructure as the number of users and the amount of information they wish to transfer increase and as customer requirements change 
we currently project our network utilization will require rapid expansion of the network capacity to avoid capacity constraints that would adversely affect system performance 
the expansion and adaptation of our network infrastructure will require substantial financial  operational and management resources in and future periods 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing requirements on a timely basis  at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
in addition  if demand for network usage were to increase faster than projected or were to exceed our current forecasts  the network could experience capacity constraints  which would adversely affect the performance of the system 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if  for any reason  we fail to 
expand our network infrastructure on a timely basis  
adapt our network infrastructure to changing customer requirements or evolving industry trends  or 
alleviate capacity constraints experienced by our network infrastructure 
currently  we have transit agreements with mci worldcom  sprint and uunet and we have peering agreements with america online  psinet and other network providers to support the exchange of traffic between our network and the internet 
we also have public peering arrangements with multiple smaller internet service providers 
these public peering arrangements also support the exchange of traffic between our network and the internet 
the failure of the networks with which we have public peering  private peering or private transit  or the failure of any of our data centers  or any other link in the delivery chain  or any inability to successfully integrate new network resources into our existing infrastructure  and resulting interruption of our operations would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our market is extremely competitive 
the market for tailored value added network services is extremely competitive 
there are no substantial barriers to entry in this market  and we expect that competition will intensify in the future 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends upon a number of factors  including 
market presence  
the capacity  reliability  low latency and security of our network infrastructure  
technical expertise and functionality  performance and quality of services  
customization  
ease of access to and navigation of the internet  
the pricing policies of our competitors and suppliers  
the variety of services  
the timing of introductions of new services by us and our competitors  
customer support  
our ability to support industry standards  and 
industry and general economic trends 
our competitors generally may be divided into four groups telecommunications companies  online service providers  internet service providers and web hosting providers 
many of our competitors have greater market presence  engineering and marketing capabilities  and financial  technological and personnel resources than those available to us 
as a result  they may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily  and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we can 
in addition to the competitors discussed above  various organizations have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortiums to provide services similar to those of our company 
we believe that new competitors will enter the value added network services market 
such new competitors could include large computer hardware  software  media and other technology and telecommunications companies 
certain telecommunications companies and online services providers are currently offering or have announced plans to offer internet or online services or to expand their network services 
certain companies  including america online  bbn  psinet and verio  have also obtained or expanded their internet access products and services as a result of acquisitions 
such acquisitions may permit our competitors to devote greater resources to the development and marketing of new competitive products and services and the marketing of existing competitive products and services 
in addition  the ability of some of our competitors to bundle other services and products with virtual private network services or internet access services could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
certain companies are also exploring the possibility of providing or are currently providing high speed data services using alternative delivery methods such as over the cable television infrastructure  through direct broadcast satellites and over wireless cable 
as a result of increased competition and vertical and horizontal integration in the industry  we could encounter significant pricing pressure 
this pricing pressure could result in significant reductions in the average selling price of our services 
for example  telecommunications companies that compete with us may be able to provide customers with reduced communications costs in connection with their internet access services or private network services  reducing the overall cost of their solutions and significantly increasing price pressures on us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to offset the effects of any such price reductions with an increase in the number of our customers  higher revenue from enhanced services  cost reductions or otherwise 
in addition  we believe that the internet access and online services businesses are likely to encounter consolidation in the near future 
consolidation could result in increased price and other competition in these industries and  potentially  the virtual private networks industry 
increased price or other competition could result in erosion of our market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to continue to compete successfully 
we must keep up with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
the markets for our services are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  emerging competition and frequent new product and service introductions 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to 
effectively use leading technologies  
continue to develop our technical expertise  
enhance our current networking services  
develop new services that meet changing customer needs  
advertise and market our services  and 
influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
all this must be accomplished in a timely and cost effective manner 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in effectively using new technologies  developing new services or enhancing our existing services on a timely basis 
we cannot assure you that such new technologies or enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in adapting our network service business to alternate access devices and conduits as they emerge 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully is also dependent upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of our services with products and architectures offered by various vendors 
although we intend to support emerging standards in the market for internet access  we cannot assure you that industry standards will be established 
if industry standards are established  we cannot assure you that we will be able to conform to these new standards in a timely fashion and maintain a competitive position in the market 
specifically  our services rely on the continued widespread commercial use of tcp ip 
alternative open protocol and proprietary protocol standards have been or are being developed 
if any of these alternative protocols become widely adopted  there may be a reduction in the use of tcp ip  which could render our services obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  we cannot assure you that services or technologies developed by others will not render our services or technology uncompetitive or obsolete 
an integral part of our strategy is to design our network to meet the requirements of emerging standards such as kbps modems and applications such as ip based interactive video and voice conferencing communications 
our initial deployment of kbps modem technology was difficult for some of our customers  including webtv  due to compatibility problems between the software and their modems 
we had to remove the software from the network and modems to fix the problem 
we are currently testing a modified version of the software and we expect to redeploy it into the network in the first quarter of however  we cannot assure you that we will successfully redeploy the software 
if we fail  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce the kbps modem technology or other new or enhanced services that are compatible with industry standards and that satisfy customer requirements  then our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
see business the concentric network 
we face the risk of fundamental changes in the way internet access is delivered 
internet services are currently accessed primarily by computers connected by telephone lines 
several companies have announced the development and planned sale of cable television modems  wireless modems and satellite modems to provide internet access 
cable television  satellite and wireless modems can transmit data at substantially faster speeds than the modems we and our subscribers currently use 
in addition  wireless modems have the potential to reduce the cost of network services 
as the internet becomes accessible through these cable television  wireless and satellite modems and by screen based telephones  televisions or other consumer electronic devices  or subscriber requirements change the way internet access is provided  we will have to develop new technology or modify our existing technology to accommodate new developments such as 
internet access through cable television  satellite and wireless modems  
internet access through screen based telephones  televisions or other consumer electronic devices  or 
subscriber requirements that change the way internet access is provided 
our pursuit of these technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in adapting our internet access business to alternate access devices and conduits 
our network system could fail 
network expansion and growth in usage will place increased stress upon our network hardware and traffic management systems 
our network has been designed with redundant backbone circuits to allow traffic re routing 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not experience failures relating to individual network pops or even catastrophic failure of the entire network 
moreover  our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our network infrastructure against damage from power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
a significant portion of our computer equipment  including critical equipment dedicated to our internet access services  is located at our facilities in chicago  illinois  and cupertino  california 
in addition  our modems and routers that serve large areas of the united states are located in these cities 
our network operations center  which manages the entire network  is in st 
louis  missouri 
despite our precautions  a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  or other unanticipated problem at the network operations center  at one of our hubs sites at which we have located routers  switches and other computer equipment that make up the backbone of our network infrastructure or at a number of our pops has from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions in our services 
in addition  our services could be interrupted if our telecommunications providers fail to provide the data communications capacity in the time frame required by us as a result of a natural disaster or for some other reason 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our system may experience security breaches 
despite the implementation of network security measures  the core of our network infrastructure is vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptive problems caused by our customers or internet users 
computer viruses  break ins or other problems caused by third parties could lead to interruptions  delays or cessation in service to our customers and subscribers 
furthermore  inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems and our customer s computer systems 
we may face liability and may lose potential subscribers as a result 
although we intend to continue to implement industry standard security measures  such measures occasionally have been circumvented in the past 
we cannot assure you that our security enclosures will not be circumvented in the future 
the costs and resources required to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems may result in interruptions  delays or cessation of service to our customers that could have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon key personnel and may be unable to timely hire and retain sufficient numbers of qualified personnel 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team  including henry r 
nothhaft  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer  and john k 
peters  the company s executive vice president and general manager  network services applications division 
the loss of the services of mr 
nothhaft or mr 
peters could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our senior officers  including mr 
nothhaft or mr 
peters 
nor do we carry key man life insurance on the life of any such persons 
our success will also depend upon the continued service of the other members of our senior management team and technical  marketing and sales personnel 
competition for qualified employees is intense 
our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management  technical  sales and marketing and customer support personnel 
locating personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy is often a lengthy process 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract additional  qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations  development efforts and ability to complete the expansion of our network infrastructure 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness and may not be able to service our debt 
we are and will continue to have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness 
we have significant debt service requirements as a result of this indebtedness 
at december   our total debt including current portion was million and stockholders deficit was million 
interest on such indebtedness totals approximately million per year 
we also issued  shares of preferred stock in june dividends accrue on the preferred stock at the rate of per year 
at december   dividends and accretion on the preferred stock totaled approximately million 
dividends and accretion will total approximately million in and are expected to grow in each successive year 
to date  we have chosen to pay such dividends in shares of preferred stock  rather than in cash 
we must also redeem the preferred stock in as a result of these and other features  the preferred stock is substantially equivalent to debt 
our debt  including the preferred stock  has important consequences for our company and for you  including the following 
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  whether for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes  may be impaired  
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of interest on our debt  which reduces the funds available to us for other purposes  
our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in market conditions may be limited  and 
we may be more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
our ability to meet our debt service and preferred stock dividend obligations will depend on our future operating performance and financial results 
this ability will be subject in part to factors beyond our control 
although we believe that our cash flow will be adequate to meet our interest and dividend payments  we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to meet our debt service and preferred stock requirements 
if we are unable to generate cash flow in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges and are unable to borrow sufficient funds from other sources  then we may be required to 
refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  or 
sell all or a portion of our assets 
we cannot assure you that a refinancing would be possible 
we cannot assure you that any asset sales would be timely or that the proceeds which we could realize from such asset sales would be sufficient to meet our debt service requirements 
in addition  the terms of our debt and preferred stock restrict our ability to sell our assets and our use of the proceeds from any such asset sale 
we may need additional capital in the future and such additional financing may not be available 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources  combined with the net proceeds from this offering and financing available under a network equipment lease agreement that currently has no maximum borrowing limit  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements through however  we cannot assure you that such resources will be sufficient for anticipated or unanticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 
take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  including more rapid international expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  
develop new products or services  or 
respond to unanticipated competitive pressures 
we may also raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings if such financings become available on favorable terms 
we cannot assure you that any additional financing we may need will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop new products or services or otherwise respond to unanticipated competitive pressures 
in such case  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth above 
we face risks associated with international expansion 
a key component of our strategy is to expand into international markets 
the following risks are inherent in doing business on an international level 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
export restrictions  
export controls relating to encryption technology  
tariffs and other trade barriers  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
longer payment cycles  
problems in collecting accounts receivable  
political instability  
fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences that could adversely impact the success of our international operations 
we cannot assure you that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have an agreement with tmi telemedia international  ltd  a subsidiary of the leading italian telecommunications company  telecom italia  spa  to establish an international network based on our network technology and expertise and tmi s existing telecommunications infrastructure 
in exchange  we granted tmi certain exclusive rights in critical markets  including europe 
while the goal of this effort is to deliver a range of compatible network services worldwide  to date we have had only limited deployment of services under this agreement 
our experience in working with tmi to develop versions of our products and to market and distribute our products internationally is limited 
our international strategy has not developed as rapidly as anticipated and may be further delayed if 
we cannot successfully deploy our technology over tmi s infrastructure  
we cannot transfer our knowledge to tmi s employees  or 
tmi does not devote sufficient management  technological or marketing resources to this project 
our business  results of operation or financial condition could be materially adversely affected if delays in our international strategy continue or worsen 
we have entered into roaming agreements with third parties to allow our customers to access their internet accounts from japan and certain other foreign countries 
we provide web hosting and extranet services for gx networks united kingdom customers pursuant to an agreement signed in august we also acquired web hosting facilities in stockholm  sweden  tokyo  japan and hong kong in february as a result of our acquisition of internex 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully market  sell and deliver our products in these markets 
our business may be impacted by the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
we are currently in the process of reviewing our products and services  as well as our internal management information systems in order to identify and modify those products  services and systems that are not year compliant 
based on our assessment to date  we have determined that our internally developed software  including much of our operational  financial and management information systems software  is year compliant 
our operational  financial and management information systems software which have not been internally developed have been certified as year compliant by the third party vendors who have supplied the software 
to the extent that our systems are not year compliant  we are modifying such systems to make them compliant 
we expect such modifications will be made on a timely basis and do not believe that the cost of such modifications will have a material effect on our operating results 
additionally  we are continuing to assess the year compliance of our products and services 
to date  most of our newly introduced products and services do not contain material year deficiencies  however some of our customers are running earlier product versions that are not year compliant 
we have been encouraging such customers to migrate to current product versions 
we estimate that the capital and other costs associated with the upgrade and conversion of our existing products  services and systems relating to the year issue will not be material 
we do not have and are not developing a contingency plan in the event our systems fail due to year related problems 
our products  services and systems operate in complex network environments and directly and indirectly interact with a number of other hardware and software systems 
we face risks to the extent that suppliers of products  services and systems purchased by us and others with whom we transact business on a worldwide basis  including those which form significant portions of our network and may be sole or limited source suppliers  do not have business systems or products that comply with year requirements 
we have not received any significant assurances from our suppliers that their networks are year compliant 
if these networks fail  our business will be significantly impacted 
our expectation that we will be able to upgrade our products  services and systems to address the year issue and our expectation regarding the costs associated with these upgrades are forward looking statements subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may vary materially as a result of a number of factors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely and successfully modify such products  services and systems to comply with year requirements 
any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
furthermore  despite testing by us and our vendors  our products  services and systems may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
in the event any material errors or defects are not detected and fixed or third parties cannot timely provide us with products  services or systems that meet the year requirements  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
known or unknown errors or defects that affect the operation of our products  services or systems could result in delay or loss of revenue  interruption of network services  cancellation of customer contracts  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  and litigation costs 
we cannot assure you that these or other factors relating to year compliance issues will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we could face government regulation 
the federal communications commission fcc currently does not regulate value added network software or computer equipment related services that transport data or ip based voice messages over telecommunication facilities as telecommunications services 
we provide value added ip based network services  in part  through data transmissions over public telephone lines 
operators of these types of value added networks that provide access to regulated transmission facilities only as part of a data services package are classified for regulatory purposes as providers of information services and are currently excluded from regulations that apply to telecommunications carriers 
as such  we are not currently subject to direct regulation by the fcc or any other governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally 
however  future changes in law or regulation could result in some aspects of our current operations becoming subject to regulation by the fcc or another regulatory agency 
the fcc currently is reviewing its regulatory positions on data transmissions over telecommunications networks and could seek to impose some form of telecommunications carrier regulation on the network transport and telecommunications functions of an enhanced or information services package 
further  the fcc could conclude that our protocol conversions  computer processing and interaction with customer supplied information are insufficient to afford us with the benefits of the enhanced or information service regulatory classification 
if the fcc reaches such conclusions  it may seek to regulate some segments of our activities as telecommunications services 
state public utility commissions generally have declined to regulate enhanced or information services 
some states  however  have continued to regulate particular aspects of enhanced services in limited circumstances  such as where they are provided by incumbent lecs that operate telecommunications networks 
moreover  the public service commissions of some states continue to review potential regulation of such services 
we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities of states where we provide internet access  intranet and vpn services will not seek to regulate aspects of these activities as telecommunications services 
the prices at which we may sell our services could be affected by regulatory changes 
in the internet connectivity market  
that indirectly or directly affect telecommunications costs  or 
that increase the likelihood or scope of competition from the rbocs 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business and we cannot assure you that future regulation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we depend on our proprietary technology and technological expertise 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our technology 
in this regard  we believe our success is more dependent upon our technical expertise than our proprietary rights 
we rely upon a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization or to develop similar technology independently 
we cannot assure you that such measures have been  or will be  adequate to protect our proprietary technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
we operate a material portion of our business over the internet 
the internet is subject to a variety of risks 
such risks include but are not limited to the substantial uncertainties that exist regarding the system for assigning domain names and the status of private rules for resolution of disputes regarding rights to domain names 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to employ our current domain names in the future or that the loss of rights to one or more domain names will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
third parties may claim we infringe their proprietary rights 
although we do not believe we infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert such claims against us in the future or that such claims will not be successful 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources to defend any claims relating to proprietary rights  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to license our products in the united states or abroad
