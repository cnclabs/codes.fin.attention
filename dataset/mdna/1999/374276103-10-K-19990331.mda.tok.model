amortization of intangibles and depreciation amortization of intangibles was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in amortization arose from the inclusion of amortization of goodwill relating to the acquisitions of photodisc and allsport 
intangibles of million and million  respectively  arose on consolidation of these acquisitions 
a substantial part of these intangibles  million  has been attributed to goodwill which is being amortized over years 
other intangibles of million are being amortized over periods varying from two to three years 
depreciation increased from million in the twelve month period ended december  to million in the year ended and million in the year ended the increase primarily arose from acquisitions  together with increased investment in capital expenditure related to the continued development of getty images digital strategy

currency movements did not have a material impact on ebitda 
year the year issue refers to the risk that systems  products and equipment having date sensitive components will not recognize the year as a result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the use of non year compliant programs or the inability of the company to update its systems successfully may result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruption of operations  the corruption of data or other business problems  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions and invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities

such suppliers can include infrastructure suppliers in areas such as utilities  communications  transportation and other services 
while the company is developing alternate power generation sources for its most sensitive systems  the likelihood and effects of failures in infrastructure systems and in the supply chain cannot be estimated 
getty images year compliance program and the company s readiness getty images developed the year compliance program the program to identify and mitigate year issues in its information systems  facilities and suppliers 
the program can be divided into three phases evaluation identify issues  inventory the systems affected and develop solutions to address the issues  implementation deploy program and software changes and complete necessary contingency plans  and testing perform applications and acceptance testing and certification 
the goals of the program are to ensure that getty images and its business divisions can continue to function at optimal levels up to and beyond december   to provide getty images customers and partners with the company s services throughout the affected period and to ensure that key suppliers are year compliant and that there will be no disruption in the supply of services and products to getty images 
the chief executive officer of the company  subject to the board of directors oversight  is responsible for the overall implementation of the program and ensuring that the company becomes year compliant by december  the senior vice president of planning is responsible for the day to day management of the program and reports directly to the board of directors of the company 
a dedicated team has been assembled to implement the program 
as of march   getty images had completed phase of the program and had partially completed phases and the company expects that the bulk of its systems will be year compliant by the end of the third quarter of  with the remainder compliant during the fourth quarter of contingency plans will be developed for any matter not resolved in that may have a material negative impact on the company s final year readiness 
evaluation the company has inventoried all of its major hardware and software platforms  as well as the relevant computer  embedded and communication systems  which may be affected by the year issue and assessed the needs of the company to become year compliant 
the company has completed a review of the year issues faced by its material suppliers and evaluated the risks and dependencies associated with such suppliers 
the review of the year issue faced by licensees and agents is scheduled to be completed by april  implementation the company is well advanced in its deployment of software and hardware changes 
year compliance measures have been incorporated into all new web initiatives  becoming the standard within the company for all new contracts and have been incorporated into the company s due diligence program when evaluating potential acquisitions and partnerships 
in addition  the company has begun preparation of its first stage contingency plan which addresses the identification of alternate suppliers and distribution channels and the implementation of manual systems if it becomes necessary 
the company expects to complete all contingency planning by the end of the second quarter of testing the company has tested its cd products and e commerce systems 
testing on the e commerce system demonstrated that certain of the systems  principally credit authorization and payment processing  needed upgrades to become year compliant 
if further testing identifies this as a problem  then a new compliant payment processor or payment software will be implemented 
the company will continue its testing of its computer  embedded and communication systems as it completes the implementation of its software and hardware changes 
getty images estimates that the expected total aggregate costs for its year activities and related systems changes from through will be approximately million  of which approximately  has been spent as of march  risks related to the year issue although the company s efforts to be year compliant are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the year issues on the company s operations and business  the actual effects of the year issue will not be known until the failure by the company and or its material suppliers to become year compliant in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s capital requirements may differ materially from the foregoing estimate as a result of regulatory  technological and competitive developments in the company s industry 
the year disclosure set forth above is intended to be a year statement as such term is defined in the year information and readiness disclosure act of the year act and  to the extent such disclosure relates to year processing of the company or to products or services offered by the company  is intended to be a year readiness disclosure as such term is defined in the year act 
the euro conversion a new european currency was implemented in january to replace the separate currencies of eleven western european countries 
this is requiring changes in the company s operations as it modifies systems and commercial arrangements to deal with the new currency 
modifications are necessary in operations such as payroll  benefits and pension systems  contracts with suppliers and customers and internal financial reporting systems  and have a particularly significant impact on the company s european subsidiaries 
although a three year transition period is expected during which transactions may also be made in the old currency  this is requiring dual currency processes for the company s operations 
the company has identified the issues involved and is developing and implementing solutions 
the company does not expect the cost of this effort to have a material effect on its business or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that all problems will be foreseen and corrected or that no material disruption of the company s business will occur
