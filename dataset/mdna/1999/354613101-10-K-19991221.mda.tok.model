item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements in this section  we discuss our results of operations and our financial condition 
we also make some statements relating to the future which are called forward looking statements 
although we do our best to make clear and accurate forward looking statements  the actual results and outcomes could be significantly different from those that we discuss in this document 
for this reason  you should not rely too heavily on these forward looking statements 
we encourage you to look at the risk factors section below  where we discuss these statements in more detail 
general the majority of our operating revenues  operating expenses and net income are derived from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual funds  institutional and private accounts  and other investment products 
this is our primary business activity and operating segment 
the mutual funds and other products that we advise  collectively called our sponsored investment products  are sold to the public via three brand names franklin templeton mutual series our sponsored investment products include a broad range of domestic and global international equity  fixed income and money market mutual funds  as well as other investment products that meet a wide variety of investment needs of individuals and institutions 
the level of our revenues is largely dependent upon the level and relative composition of assets under management 
to a lesser degree  our revenues are also dependent on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts between ourselves and our sponsored investment products or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business activity and operating segment is banking finance 
our banking finance group offers consumer lending and selected retail banking services to individuals 
franklin templeton operates primarily in the united states  but we also provide services and earn revenues in canada  the bahamas  europe and asia pacific 
most of these revenues and associated expenses  however  are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our revenues and expenses is not significant 
this situation may change in the future as our business grows outside the united states 
at september   we employed approximately  people in over countries  serving customers on six different continents 
assets under management in billions as of september  vs vs franklin templeton group equity global international domestic us total equity hybrid funds fixed income tax free taxable domestic primarily us government global international total fixed income money funds total monthly average for the year our assets under management at the end of our fiscal year were billion  higher than they were at the end of last year 
however  the monthly average value of these assets during was billion as compared to billion in  a drop 
the change in the monthly average assets under management is more indicative of investment management fee revenues than the increase in year end assets 
during  our sponsored investment products experienced overall net cash outflows in contrast to the net cash inflows experienced in and in  this trend was offset to some extent by market appreciation of these assets 
in  market depreciation  principally in the fourth quarter  was offset by net cash inflows 
results of operations the table below presents the highlights of our operations for the last three years 
in millions except per share amounts vs vs net income earnings per share basic diluted without restructuring charge operating margin as reported without restructuring charge ebitda margin as reported without restructuring charge ebitda margin is earnings before interest  taxes on income  depreciation and the amortization of intangibles divided by total revenues 
net income and diluted earnings per share for decreased by  principally as a result of decreased investment management fee revenues and a restructuring charge recognized in net income and diluted earnings per share for increased by and  respectively  principally as a result of increased investment management fee revenues 
the table below presents the percentage change in each category between and and between and operating revenues as a percentage of total revenues vs vs investment management fees underwriting and distribution fees shareholder servicing fees other  net total operating revenues summary in  domestic and international equity markets were volatile 
investment management fees and underwriting and distribution fees fell as the average value of our assets and sales volumes decreased from levels  particularly in our sponsored equity funds 
in  all categories of revenues increased from the previous year s levels as a result of increases in the average values of assets  sales and shareholder accounts 
investment management fees investment management fees  the largest component of our operating revenues include both investment advisory and fund administration fees 
these fees are generally calculated under fixed fee arrangements as a percentage of the value of assets under management 
annual rates vary and generally decline as the average net assets of the portfolios exceed certain threshold levels 
in return for these fees  we provide investment advisory and administrative services 
there have been no significant changes in these fee structures for the funds and accounts that we manage in the years under review 
investment management fees decreased in fiscal  primarily due to lower average assets under management 
in  revenues fell faster than average assets due to a shift in our asset mix towards lower fee fixed income products 
consistent with this trend  the effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by average assets under management decreased in to compared to in future changes in the composition of assets under management will likely affect our effective investment management fee rate 
in fiscal  an increase in average assets under management led to a increase in investment management fees 
underwriting and distribution fees underwriting commissions are earned from the sale of certain classes of mutual funds that have a front end sales commission 
distribution fees are paid by our sponsored mutual funds in return for sales and marketing efforts on their behalf 
distribution fees include b plan fees which are subject to maximum pay out levels  based upon a percentage of the assets in each fund 
a significant portion of underwriting commissions and distribution fees are paid to the brokers and other intermediaries who sell funds to the public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 
underwriting and distribution fees decreased in underwriting commissions decreased as a result of a drop in gross mutual fund sales from levels 
distribution fees also decreased as a result of the decrease in average assets under management 
underwriting and distribution fees increased in due to the increased value of average assets under management and increased mutual fund sales in over levels 
shareholder servicing fees shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
fees are received for each shareholder account as compensation for providing transfer agency services which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service and tax reporting 
in accordance with current agreements with the funds  closed accounts in a given calendar year remain billable through the second quarter of the following calendar year at a reduced rate 
in  shareholder servicing fees increased over as a result of a million increase in average billable shareholder accounts  a substantial portion of which were closed accounts  and an increase in the per account charge 
shareholder servicing fees increased in compared to this increase was primarily the result of an increase in billable shareholder accounts 
other  net other  net consists primarily of revenues from the banking finance operating segment operating revenues  consisting primarily of interest and servicing income interest expense  and provision for loan losses other  net decreased in primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses 
charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding increased in over also  loan balances increased million at september   compared to september  in addition  during  a portion of the reserves related to auto loans was released because of improved loss experience over we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking finance segment of a basis point movement in market interest rates and we do not expect it would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations 
operating expenses as a percentage of total expenses vs vs underwriting and distribution compensation and benefits information systems  technology and occupancy advertising and promotion amortization of deferred sales commissions amortization of intangible assets other restructuring charges total operating expenses underwriting and distribution includes sales commissions and distribution fees paid to brokers and other third parties for selling and distributing our funds to the public 
during  underwriting and distribution expenses decreased  consistent with the trend in underwriting and distribution revenues 
during  underwriting and distribution expenses increased  consistent with the trend in revenues 
compensation and benefits decreased in  primarily due to decreased temporary labor costs and employee overtime 
we also have reduced the number of full time employees throughout in january  we announced that we were eliminating positions  primarily as a result of efficiencies gained from conversion to one domestic transfer agency system 
through employee attrition and turnover the number of employees decreased a further  by september  from the previous year 
in  compensation and benefits increased over the prior year  reflecting an increase in the number of full time employees and in temporary labor costs 
in order to be able to hire and retain our key employees in the current labor market  we are committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive  which may mean that the level of compensation and benefits will increase more quickly than inflation 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in and in during the past three years  we have started major systems implementations including the conversion to one transfer agency from three  our year project and euro preparations  and we have upgraded our network  desktop and internet environments 
we are also developing e business strategies to meet the needs of our distribution network and our mutual fund shareholders 
we expect that such major systems undertakings will continue to have an impact on our operating results through fiscal and beyond 
advertising and promotion expenses decreased in and increased in in  we reduced expenditures on media advertising and reduced other promotional activities in line with our general cost saving efforts 
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased in and increased in certain fund classes are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  while  at the same time  we pay a commission to selling brokers and others 
we expect to recover the payments in distribution revenues and contingent deferred sales charges over periods of up to a maximum of eight years following the sale 
accordingly  the payments are capitalized and amortized over periods not exceeding eight years 
in the second quarter of  our sponsored canadian funds arranged for financing of these sales commissions directly with a third party 
the amortization of deferred sales decreased in as a result of decreased sales of these products and as a result of the third party financing of canadian sales 
in  these amounts increased as a result of increased sales 
during  we recognized pretax restructuring charges of million or per diluted share after tax 
these charges were related to a plan initiated by management in the first quarter of fiscal see note to the financial statements 
we do not expect to incur any additional charges with respect to the plan during fiscal of the million total restructuring charge  approximately was utilized during the anticipated lost revenues associated with discontinued products are not expected to have a material impact on ongoing results of operations 
at the completion of these restructuring efforts  our annual operating expenses are expected to decrease approximately million from peak levels in fiscal these expectations may be affected by changes in the business environment in future years  but in the nine months since we announced the restructuring plan  we have realized over million reduction in controllable expenses from peak periods in a substantial portion of the savings came from decreased employee  occupancy and associated other costs as a result of the reduction in the workforce discussed above 
for the year ended september   the savings recognized from the restructuring plan have been partially offset by increased information system and technology costs as we continue to invest in our business 
other income expense investment and other income is made up primarily of dividends from investments in our sponsored mutual funds  and interest income from investments in bonds and government securities 
it also includes realized gains and losses from the sale of investment securities  realized foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous income 
see note to the financial statements 
in  higher interest income was offset by lower dividend income and reduced realized gains from the sale of investments 
investment income increased in primarily as the result of the investment of increased operating cash flows in interest earning accounts and securities 
interest expense decreased in due to a reduction in debt used to finance our investment management operating segment 
during  average debt used to finance consumer auto loans also decreased resulting in lower interest expense for the banking finance group 
see other  net revenues above 
interest expense decreased in  primarily due to increased operating cash flows and to the capitalization of interest related to borrowings used to finance construction of a number of new office buildings 
taxes on income our effective income tax rate for fiscal remained relatively stable on an annual basis at  the same rate as in the effective tax rate will continue to be reflective of the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million at september  liquid assets  which consist of cash and cash equivalents  investments available for sale and current receivables increased to  million at september  from  million at september  at september   approximately million was available to franklin templeton under unused commercial paper and medium term note programs 
revolving credit facilities at september  aggregated million of which million was under a day facility 
the remaining million facility will expire in may cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in  from million in this decline was due mainly to lower net income in the current fiscal year 
during the year ended september   we generated net cash of million from investing activities 
net liquidation of investments generated million and we purchased million fixed assets  net of disposals and invested million  net in our banking finance segment 
the million invested was made up of million in net new loans originated  partially offset by million received in the may securitization of auto loans and million received from the net sale of investments 
net cash used in financing activities during the year was million  compared to million in we repaid million of debt  net of new borrowings  purchased million shares of our common stock for million  paid million in dividends to stockholders  repaid million of deposits of the banking finance group and received million from the exercise of stock options 
outstanding debt declined to million at september   compared to million at september  debt primarily consisted of fixed interest medium term notes and commercial paper that carried interest at variable rates 
as described in note to the financial statements  we participate in the financial derivatives markets solely to manage our exposure to variable interest rate fluctuations on a portion of commercial paper 
our overall weighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper and medium term notes was at both september  and september  through our interest rate swap agreements and medium term note program  we have fixed the rates of interest we pay on of our outstanding debt 
during september  we entered into a series of agreements to finance the construction of a new corporate headquarters on a acre site in san mateo  california 
an owner lessor trust has been set up to finance the construction and lease the completed facility to franklin templeton 
the agreements are not expected to impact our cash flows or financial condition materially during the initial five year lease period 
during  franklin templeton also arranged for third party  non recourse financing of sales commissions on its b shares 
at september   the amounts financed by us under this arrangement are not material 
management expects that the principal future needs for cash will be to advance sales commissions  fund increased property and equipment acquisitions including information systems and technology  pay stockholder dividends and service debt 
management believes that existing liquid assets  together with the expected continuing cash flow from operations  our borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and our ability to issue stock will be sufficient to meet our present and reasonably foreseeable future cash needs 
the banking finance segment s cash needs are expected to be met from existing cash flows or from additional securitizations of loans receivable 
year readiness disclosure background 
before work commenced on what is commonly known as the year problem  many of the world s computer systems recorded years in a two digit format 
without remediation  such computer systems might have been unable to recognize  interpret or use dates in and beyond the year correctly 
because a significant number of key transactions for most businesses are affected by dates or are date related  the inability to use such date information correctly could lead to business disruptions both in the united states and internationally 
the short time frames within which computer systems must receive and process data to complete securities transactions increases the potential impact of the year problem for the financial services industry 
year readiness 
all of our mission critical systems and important non mission critical systems have now been certified as year compliant as described below and are operating in production 
we will focus our efforts through year end on updating verification of third party readiness  reviewing  refining and testing our contingency plans  including detailed year end cross over plans and additional integrated testing of certain systems 
certification and testing process 
our year certification process included assessment  remediation and a number of prescribed tests either established by franklin templeton and or the vendor of the system 
although franklin templeton believes that its systems are ready and will function correctly in the year  no testing procedures can absolutely guarantee that a system which has been certified as year compliant will be free of difficulties associated with the year industry testing 
during  franklin templeton successfully participated in several industry wide tests the securities industry association s street wide testing held over five weekends in march and april  testing of major real time market data services in may  and six days of testing interfaces with major broker dealers in july 
these tests included simulated year securities transactions and market data feeds  and involved the major north american securities exchanges  securities clearing organizations  financial information services  market data services  major banks  brokerages and investment advisory and investment management companies in the united states 
third parties and year franklin templeton s operating segments are heavily dependent upon a complex worldwide network of information technology systems  some of which are owned and managed by third parties 
some of these third party systems are franklin templeton s mission critical systems 
these third party systems include data feeds  trading systems  securities transfer agent operations and stock market links 
there were a number of third party systems that we could not test ourselves and for these systems we relied upon vendor representations  the results of point to point testing  or test scripts supplied by the vendor 
franklin templeton has contacted all of its major external suppliers of goods and services to assess their compliance efforts and our exposure in the event that third party compliance efforts fail 
in addition  certain of these third parties assisted us with modifying and testing our systems  and participated in street wide testing with franklin templeton and with one another 
to date  no major third party supplier has informed us that it would not be year compliant or year ready by the millennium date  nor has our testing with third parties revealed any significant non compliance issues 
communication with third parties will continue as we proceed with our year project  and into the year to monitor system functions 
however  no testing or inquiries with respect to third party systems can absolutely guaranty that problems related to the year will not occur 
contingency planning 
extensive preparation efforts cannot guarantee a total absence of year problems 
therefore  we continue to develop  exercise  and integrate comprehensive worldwide contingency plans 
all of franklin templeton s worldwide contingency plans have been formulated and tested  we expect to refine  change and update our contingency plans through the rollover date 
in addition to technical systems matters  the contingency planning process considered operational issues such as an increased volume of shareholder requests  cash flow matters related to purchase or redemption volumes  market adjustments and other areas of potential disruptions 
as part of the effort to create a smooth transition to the year  franklin templeton formed a worldwide year cross over team with representatives from each major business function 
this team will staff command centers around the world from december through the end of the first week of january during the cross over weekend  personnel will be at key command centers hours a day  beginning with the first rollovers to the year in australia  hong kong and singapore until the final rollover at franklin templeton s headquarters in california 
due to the complexity and magnitude of our business processes there are  in certain cases  limited or no alternatives to some of our mission critical systems or public utilities 
it is not possible to predict which internal or external systems or utilities may be affected worldwide  or the exact nature of all problems that might occur 
while redundant systems and multi day back up power sources are in place at franklin templeton s main data centers to address communication or power interruptions  if telephone systems or public utilities fail in multiple locations or if mission critical systems of franklin templeton or third parties fail  there could be a material adverse impact upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this is especially true if such outages or failures were to extend for a period of many days 
cost estimates 
the total estimated costs through march associated with the year project are expected to be between million and million  including an unallocated amount for unanticipated costs 
these estimated costs are mainly internal and third party labor costs which are expensed as incurred 
the total amount expended on the project through september  was approximately million 
franklin templeton s estimate of the total costs to complete the year project will continue to be refined in future periods 
liquidity 
franklin templeton believes that its liquid assets  together with existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet any corporate needs related to year problems 
however  in the event of a worldwide liquidity crisis or broad based market panic  no financial organization can absolutely assure that it or its managed portfolios would not be impacted 
franklin templeton also has arranged a million short term special line of credit for certain of its domestic sponsored retail mutual funds to assist in meeting liquidity requirements that could arise out of year concerns 
non it systems 
all of our non information technology non it systems have been certified as being year ready  either by internal verification or by third party representations  for franklin templeton s domestic properties and foreign properties over  square feet 
like other companies  franklin templeton is dependent upon certain non it systems such as third party long distance telephone and data lines  and public utility electrical power 
we do not expect to experience any material effects related to the year compliance of non it systems unless there are widespread national or international telephone and data line  or general public utility problems  beyond our control 
specific risks associated with the year franklin templeton s ability to manage year issues is subject to uncertainties beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above 
franklin templeton could become subject to legal claims in the event of any year problem in our business operations 
in addition  we are subject to regulation by various domestic and international authorities which could impose sanctions or fines or cause us to cease certain operations in the event our systems are not year compliant 
if there is a general disruption in securities or capital markets  or if investors withdraw funds because they are concerned about year issues  this could create global liquidity issues that could have a material adverse effect upon franklin templeton s business  financial condition and results of operations 
these types of disruptions could occur regardless of the existence or severity of year problems  as a result of overreaction or market panic in response to even minor year problems or false reports of year problems 
if there are year system interruptions or failures of important third parties  such as securities transfer agents  stock exchanges  data providers or other organizations such as those mentioned above under third parties and year  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although certain third parties may represent that their systems are year ready  there can be no assurance that their systems are in fact year compliant or that they have provided complete and accurate information to franklin templeton 
factors that could influence the impact of the year problem also include the success of franklin templeton in identifying systems and programs that are affected 
other factors include the nature and amount of testing  remediation  programming  installation and systems work required to upgrade or to replace each of the affected programs or systems  the rate  magnitude and availability of related labor and consulting costs  our success in correcting our internal systems and the success of franklin templeton s external partners and suppliers in addressing their respective year problems 
risk factors forward looking statements 
when used in this annual report  words or phrases about the future such as expected to  will continue  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of statements about key employee compensation  financing construction of our new corporate headquarters  our future cash needs and the expected sources of future cash inflows  estimates about our year plan  including cost projections  statements about possible effects of the year problem and contingency plans are also forward looking statements 
these types of statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  such as the factors described in specific risks associated with the year above and the risk factors outlined below 
these risks and uncertainties could cause our current expectations and predictions in the forward looking statements to be wrong 
forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made  and you should not rely on them 
rather  you should read the forward looking statements in conjunction with the risk disclosures in this annual report 
if a circumstance occurs that causes any of our forward looking statements to be inaccurate  franklin templeton does not have an obligation to publicly release the change to our expectations  or to make any revision to the forward looking statements 
franklin templeton faces strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with numerous stock brokerage and investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  online and internet investment sites  savings and loan associations and other financial institutions 
these companies also offer financial services and other investment alternatives 
in recent years  there has been a trend of consolidation in the mutual fund industry  resulting in stronger competitors with greater financial resources than franklin templeton 
there has also been a trend toward online internet financial services 
we are currently expanding our internet e business  but there can be no assurance that our e business will compete effectively with other alternatives available to investors 
to the extent that existing customers stop investing with us and instead invest with our competitors  or if potential customers decide to invest with other companies instead  this could cause our market share  revenues and net income to decline 
competing securities dealers and banks could restrict sales of our funds 
although we rely on securities dealers to sell and distribute franklin  templeton and mutual series fund shares  many of those securities dealers also have mutual funds under their own names that compete directly with our products 
the banking industry also continues to expand its sponsorship of proprietary funds 
these firms or banks could decide to limit or restrict the sale of our fund shares  which could lower our future sales and cause our revenues to decline 
we currently rely upon our distribution channels 
franklin templeton derives nearly all of its income from sales made by broker dealers and other similar investment advisors  and we are heavily dependent upon these distribution channels 
however  there is increasing competition to get into these channels  which has caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future 
higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings 
if one of these major financial advisors had to cease operations  even for a few days  due to year problems or for other reasons  it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
similarly  franklin templeton relies upon these business relationships and there is no guarantee that good relations can be maintained 
if we cannot effectively compete  distribute and sell our products  this would have a negative effect on our level of assets under management  related revenues and overall business and financial condition 
new share classes bring in lower revenues and have reduced operating margins 
franklin templeton receives no or reduced sales charges at the time of an initial investment in b shares and c shares but still must pay the related dealer commission 
in addition  due to industry competition  the dealer commissions that we pay on these types of shares are now higher than in the past and may increase in the future 
this could potentially have a negative effect on our liquidity and operating margins 
if our asset mix shifts to predominantly fixed income  our revenues would decline 
we derive higher fee revenues and income from the equity assets that we manage 
a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products has caused in the past  and would cause in the future  a decline in our income and revenue 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the global equity markets 
as franklin templeton s asset mix has shifted since from predominantly fixed income to a majority of equity assets  we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in global equity markets 
declines in these markets have caused in the past  and would cause in the future  a decline in our income and revenue 
global economic conditions  interest rates  inflation rates and other factors which are difficult to predict affect the mix  market values  and levels of our assets under management 
fluctuations in interest rates and in the yield curve will affect the value of fixed income assets under management as well as the flow of monies to and from fixed income funds 
in turn  this affects our revenues from those funds 
in addition  changes in the equity marketplace may significantly affect the level of our assets under management 
the factors above often operate inversely on equity funds and fixed income funds  making it difficult to predict the net effect of any particular set of conditions 
general economic and securities markets fluctuations affect our business 
adverse general securities market conditions  currency fluctuations  governmental regulations and recessionary global economic conditions could lower franklin templeton s mutual fund share sales and other financial services products sales 
an inability to meet cash needs could have a negative effect on our financial condition and business operations 
franklin templeton s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value  our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock 
similarly  our ability to securitize future portfolios of auto loan and credit card receivables would also be affected by the market s perception of those portfolios  finance rates offered by competitors  and the general market for private debt 
we face increased competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 
our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the competition from other companies to hire these kinds of employees has increased  particularly in certain geographic locations where the majority of our workforce is employed 
we may be forced to offer compensation and benefits to these employees at a level that exceeds inflation 
with historically low unemployment in the united states  qualified personnel are now moving between firms and starting their own companies with greater frequency 
if franklin templeton is not able to attract and retain these employees  our overall business condition and revenues could suffer 
our emerging market portfolios and related revenues are subject to increased risks 
these portfolios and our revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political and diplomatic developments  currency fluctuations  social instability  changes in governmental polices  expropriation  nationalization  asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership 
foreign trading markets  particularly in some emerging market countries are often smaller  less liquid  less regulated and significantly more volatile 
our securitized consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation and competes with businesses with significantly larger portfolios 
auto loan and credit card portfolio losses can be influenced significantly by trends in the economy and credit markets which reduce borrowers ability to repay loans 
diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans 
we compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans  including the finance subsidiaries of large automobile manufacturers 
some of these competitors can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales 
we rely on our relationships with various automobile dealers and there is no guarantee that we can maintain relationships with these dealers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial position of franklin templeton is subjected to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
franklin templeton is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily in its debt transactions 
through its interest rate swap agreements and its medium term note program franklin templeton has effectively fixed the rate of interest it pays on of its debt outstanding at september  as a result  franklin templeton does not believe that the effect of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on franklin templeton s financial position  results of operations or cash flow would be material 
we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking finance segment of a basis point movement in market interest rates and we do not expect it would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations
