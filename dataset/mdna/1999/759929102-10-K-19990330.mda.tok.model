these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the market demand and acceptance of the corporation s existing and new loan and deposit products  the impact of competitive products  the company s ability to achieve the desired consolidation efficiencies from its planned acquisitions  and changes in economic conditions  such as inflation or fluctuations in interest rates

asset liability management and liquidity liquidity the asset liability management committee alco reviews the company s liquidity  which is its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  deposit withdrawals  and other cash demands 
the primary sources of funds consist of deposits  amortization and prepayments of loans  sales of investments  other funds from operations and the company s capital 
the bank is a member of the fhlb and has the ability to borrow to supplement its liquidity needs 
when the company s primary sources of funds are not sufficient to meet its liquidity needs  the company may supplementally borrow funds from the fhlb and from other sources 
the fhlb acts as an additional source of funding for banks and thrift institutions that make residential mortgage loans 
fhlb borrowings  known as advances  are secured by the bank s mortgage loan portfolio  and the terms and rates charged for fhlb advances vary based on an institution s loan portfolio and in response to general economic conditions 
as a shareholder of the fhlb  the bank is authorized to apply for advances from this bank 
varieties of borrowing plans are offered by the fhlb  each with its own maturity and interest rate 
the fhlb will consider various factors  including an institution s regulatory capital position  net income  quality and composition of assets  lending policies and practices  and level of current borrowings from all sources  in determining the amount of credit to extend to an institution 
as of december   the bank had million of outstanding advances from the fhlb 
see business supervision and regulation federal home loan bank system and liquidity 
at december   the bank s liquidity ratio  defined as net cash and investments of million divided by net deposits and short term liabilities of million  was as compared to at december  net liquid assets were million in excess of the amount required by florida banking regulations 
asset liability management one of the primary objectives of the company is to reduce fluctuations in net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
to manage interest rate risk  the board of directors has established interest rate risk policies and procedures which delegate to alco the responsibility to monitor and report on interest rate risk  devise strategies to manage interest rate risk  monitor loan originations and deposit activity  and approve all pricing strategies 
the management of interest rate risk is one of the most significant factors affecting the ability to achieve future earnings 
the measure of the mismatch of assets maturing or re pricing within certain periods  and liabilities maturing or re pricing within the same period  is commonly referred to as the gap for such period 
controlling the maturity or re pricing of an institution s assets and liabilities in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
negative gap occurs when  during a specific time period  an institution s liabilities are scheduled to re price more rapidly than its assets  so that  barring other factors affecting interest income and expense  in periods of rising interest rates the institution s interest expense would increase more rapidly than its interest income  and in periods of falling interest rates the institution s interest expense would decrease more rapidly than its interest income 
positive gap occurs when an institution s assets are scheduled to re price more rapidly than its liabilities  so that  barring other factors affecting interest income and expense  in periods of falling interest rates the institution s interest income would decrease more rapidly than its interest expense  and in periods of rising interest rates the institution s interest income would increase more rapidly than its interest expense 
it is common to focus on the one year gap  which is the difference between the dollar amount of assets and the dollar amount of liabilities maturing or re pricing within the next months 
alco uses an industry standard computer modeling system to analyze the impact of financial strategies prior to their implementation 
the system attempts to simulate the asset and liability base and project future operating results under a variety of interest rates and spread assumptions 
through this management tool  management can also  among other things  project the effects of changing its asset and liability mix and modifying its balance sheet  and identify appropriate investment opportunities 
the results of these simulations are evaluated within the context of the interest rate risk policy  which sets out target levels for the appropriate level of interest rate risk 
the policy is to maintain a cumulative one year gap of no more than of total assets 
management attempts to conform to this policy primarily by managing the maturity distribution of its investment portfolio and emphasizing loan originations and loan purchases carrying variable interest rates tied to interest sensitive indices 
additionally  the bank has joined the fhlb to enhance its liquidity position and to provide it with the ability to utilize long term fixed rate advances to improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in certain periods 
currently  off balance sheet hedging instruments are not used to manage overall interest rate risk but such instruments are used to limit the exposure to changes in the value of residential loans held for resale and estimated loan commitments to originate and close fixed rate residential and mortgage loans 
however  there continues to be a risk that such loan commitments do not close or are renegotiated in a declining interest rate environment 
management may expand its use of off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage exposure to overall interest rate risk in the future  subject to board approval 
the cumulative one year gap at december   was a negative million  or a negative expressed as a percentage of total assets 
management will attempt to moderate any lengthening of the re pricing structure of earning assets by emphasizing variable rate assets and  where appropriate  match funding longer term fixed rate loans with fhlb advances 
see business sources of funds 
the following table presents the maturities or re pricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the balances shown have been derived based on the financial characteristics of the various assets and liabilities 
adjustable and floating rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than their scheduled maturity dates 
fixed rate loans are shown in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid according to contractual amortization and  where appropriate  prepayment assumptions  based on the coupon rates in the portfolio have been used to adjust the repayment amounts 
re pricing of time deposits is based on their scheduled maturities 
based on management s experience in the markets in which the company operates  statement savings deposits are assumed to re price at of the total balance in the first three months  in the four to twelve month category  and the remaining from one to five years 
passbook savings deposits are assumed to re price equally over a month period 
re pricing of interest checking is assumed to occur at of the total balance for every three month interval over a year period and re pricing of money market accounts is assumed at of the total balance over a month period
