item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis mesa air group  inc and its subsidiaries are a group of regional airlines and related companies providing service across the united states as america west express  mesa airlines  usairways express  and until may   as united express 
the following tables set forth selected operating and financial data of mesa for the years indicated below operating data years ended september passengers    available seat miles    revenue passenger miles    load factor revenue per asm cent cent cent yield per rpm cent cent cent cost per asm cent cent cent financial data years ended september percent cost percent cost percent cost amount of per amount of per amount of per revenues asm revenues asm revenues asm flight operations  cent  cent  cent maintenance  cent  cent  cent aircraft and traffic  cent  cent  cent servicing promotion and sales  cent  cent  cent general and administrative  cent  cent  cent depreciation and amortization  cent  cent  cent other operating items  cent  cent  cent total operating expenses  cent  cent  cent interest expense  cent  cent  cent revenue and expense comparison fiscal versus fiscal operating revenues decreased by million for fiscal year ended september   compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the termination of mesa s united express operations on the west coast and denver  colorado in april and may  this represents a decrease in passengers  partially offset by an increase in average fares 
capacity  measured by available seat miles asms  decreased by and passenger traffic  measured by revenue passenger miles rpms  which represents one passenger carried one mile  decreased by 
the load factor decreased from to  yield passenger revenue per rpm decreased to cent in fiscal from cent per rpm  and revenue per asm decreased to cent from cent per asm in fiscal the airline industry has a history of fare and traffic volatility 
management expects revenue per available seat mile to remain relatively stable in existing markets during the next fiscal year 
however  the crj jet aircraft  which is faster and flown over a longer stage length than turbo prop aircraft  generates lower revenue per asm than turbo prop aircraft 
because mesa expects to operate increasing numbers of crj aircraft in the future  overall revenue per asm and cost per asm is expected to be lower in the fiscal year than that attained in fiscal flight operations expense decreased by percent to million cent per asm for the fiscal year  from million cent per asm for the comparable period in fuel costs decreased by million during the current period as compared to the prior period  primarily as a result of operating fewer aircraft in on an asm basis  fuel costs decreased to cent during the current period from cent in the prior period as a result of longer stage length and more efficient aircraft 
pilot costs decreased by million during the year  remaining at cent per asm for both the fiscal years ending september  and pilot training costs increased by million for the fiscal year ended september   from the fiscal year ended september  due to the retraining costs associated with adding crj aircraft into the fleet 
dispatch costs increased by 
million in the period due to the stricter operating requirements of far part these cost increases were partially offset by an approximate million reduction in aircraft lease expense  from cent per asm in the fiscal year to cent in the fiscal year  which resulted from flying fewer aircraft 
ownership costs of owned aircraft are reported as depreciation and interest expense rather than flight operations expense 
maintenance costs decreased by to million cent per asm for the fiscal year  from million cent per asm for the prior year 
engine overhaul expenses decreased by million due to the decline in fleet size 
these savings were partially offset by increased parts usage of million and accrued costs for engine overhauls for the dash and crj engines on power by the hour contracts 
aircraft and traffic servicing costs decreased by to million cent per asm during fiscal from million cent per asm in fiscal station wages decreased by million or from cent per asm in fiscal to cent per asm in fiscal due to more efficient staffing 
station rent decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal due to the elimination of the higher rental cost west coast and denver operations 
promotion and sales expense decreased by to million cent per asm during fiscal from million cent per asm in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in booking fees 
mesa s new contract with america west eliminates booking fees and travel agency commissions  and thus these expenses are expected to continue to decrease in fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million to million in fiscal and interest expense decreased by million to million in such period 
the decrease in depreciation was due to the write off of the denver system intangibles at september  in connection with the termination of the united express operations 
the decrease in the interest expense was due to lower outstanding loan balances as a result of the retirement of aircraft 
at december  and september   mesa recognized provisions of million and million  respectively  for the termination of the united express operations which included the non renewal of the westair  and early termination of the mai  code sharing agreements with ual 
these provisions are included in other operating items 
see footnotes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
both the million and the million provisions provide for the estimated loss on the retirement or sale of aircraft  parts and equipment which were surplus to the needs of mesa upon expiration and early termination of the code sharing agreements 
in addition  the provision includes an estimate for all other anticipated costs of discontinuation or sale of mesa s westair  denver and pacific northwest operations 
other operating items in fiscal also include million for the termination of the ft 
worth jet operations  and million for the settlement of a shareholder lawsuit 
other operating items in fiscal also include a gain from the settlement with an aircraft manufacturer of million and a million aircraft return provision related to the final settlement and return of mesa s fokker aircraft 
fiscal versus fiscal operating revenues increased by million for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in operating revenues is the result of a increase in passengers  partially offset by a decrease in average fares 
capacity  measured by asms  increased by and passenger traffic  measured by rpms  increased by 
the load factor increased from to  yield decreased to cent in fiscal from cent per rpm  and revenue per asm increased to cent from cent per asm in fiscal flight operations expense increased by to million cent per asm for the fiscal year ended september   from million cent per asm for the year ended september  fuel costs increased by million to cent per asm from cent per asm during the current period as compared to the prior period 
of that increase  million is a result of a cent per gallon increase in the average price of fuel with increased usage accounting for the balance 
pilot costs increased by million during the year due primarily to a million increase in pilot wages and payroll taxes 
of this increase million was a result of increased rates of pay associated with the new pilot contract which became effective in december and million of the increase was due to an increase in the number of pilots employed 
the costs of pilot meals and lodging increased by million as a result of the new contract and conversion to operating under far part dispatch costs increased by million and pilot training costs rose by million in the period due to the stricter operating requirements of far part these cost increases were partially offset by an approximate million reduction in aircraft lease costs during the fiscal year which resulted from the purchase of aircraft in may  previously operated by mesa under operating leases 
aircraft ownership costs are reported as depreciation and interest expense rather than flight operations expense 
maintenance costs increased by million to million cent per asm for the fiscal year  from million cent per asm for the prior year 
the requirements of operating under far part  the associated new training requirements and implementation of the consent order with the faa resulted in a increase in the number of mechanics per airplane in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in number of mechanics per aircraft and a wage increase granted to the mechanics resulted in increasing labor costs by approximately million during the fiscal year 
an increase in the number of aircraft engine overhauls resulted in an increase in engine overhaul expense of million 
aircraft and traffic servicing costs increased to million cent per asm during fiscal from million cent per asm in fiscal station labor costs rose by million due to an across the board wage increase granted in september in order to attract and retain qualified individuals 
non completion costs increased by million in fiscal the increase was caused by a higher than normal level of flight cancellations as a result of flight crew scheduling difficulties and training delays 
the flight crew scheduling difficulties and training delays were related to the significant changes required by conversion to far part and compliance with the faa consent order 
deicing costs increased 
million and security expenses increased 
million in over the prior year 
increased costs of security are directly related to the increase in passengers carried 
promotion and sales expense increased slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal general and administrative costs declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced management compensation expense under the management incentive program 
depreciation and amortization expense rose by million to million and interest expense increased by million to million 
the increase in depreciation and interest expense was due to the purchase of aircraft in may  which had previously been operated by mesa under operating leases  and the purchase of new beechcraft aircraft financed with debt 
at september   mesa recognized a provision of million for the non renewal of the westair  and early termination of the mai  code sharing agreements with ual 
this provision is included in other operating items 
see footnotes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the million provision provides for the estimated loss on the retirement or sale of aircraft  parts and equipment which are expected to be surplus to the needs of mesa upon expiration and early termination of the code sharing agreements 
in addition  the provision included an estimate for all other anticipated costs of discontinuation or sale of mesa s westair  denver and pacific northwest operations 
other operating items in fiscal also includes a gain from the settlement with an aircraft manufacturer of million and a million aircraft return provision related to the final settlement and return of mesa s fokker aircraft 
in fiscal  mesa recognized a million provision related to return of the fokker aircraft 
mesa s effective tax rate of is comparable with prior years 
liquidity and capital resources mesa s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of september  were million  representing a decrease of million over the prior year 
mesa s net cash flows used in operations was approximately million during  primarily as a result of the termination of the united express code sharing agreement 
mesa s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are intended to be used for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
mesa had receivables of approximately million at september   which consist primarily of amounts due from code sharing partner usairways 
under the terms of the usairways agreement  mesa receives a substantial portion of its revenues through the airline clearing house 
historically  mesa has generated adequate cash flow to meet its operating needs 
however  termination of the united express code sharing agreement has left mesa with excess aircraft which will need to be re deployed on other routes  or alternatively  sold or returned to their lessors 
at september   mesa had excess beech d aircraft  of which two were sold subsequent to september  at september   mesa had seven embraer brasilia aircraft which will all be traded in on new crj aircraft 
the manufacturer intends to reimburse mesa for the lease cost until the aircraft are sold or leased elsewhere 
by december  three of the embraer brasilia aircraft had been traded in on crj aircraft 
management s belief that mesa will have adequate cash flow to meet its operating needs is a forward looking statement 
actual cash flow could materially differ from the forward looking statement in the event of the termination of one or more code sharing agreements  failure to sell  dispose of  or re deploy excess aircraft in a timely manner  a substantial decrease in the number of routes allocated to mai under its code sharing agreement with usairways  termination of one or more of mesa s credit facilities resulting in the need to repay unanticipated debt  reduced levels of passenger revenue  additional taxes or costs of compliance with governmental regulations  fuel cost increases  increase in competition  increase in interest rates  general economic conditions and unfavorable settlement of existing or potential litigation 
mesa has minimal market risk with respect to market risk instruments such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk 
mesa is subject to interest rate risk with respect to current and future aircraft financings 
on march   mesa s million secured line of credit expired by its terms and the bank declined to renew it 
mesa has million in restricted cash to secure letters of credit for various airports under this line of credit at september  mesa has significant lease obligations and debt payments on existing aircraft 
at september   mesa had aircraft with debt balances with maturities through december during  raytheon aircraft credit corporation racc provided financing on beech d aircraft 
in april  mesa reached an agreement with racc  to defer the monthly principle and interest payments due on the aircraft for the months of may  june and july 
the payments were deferred by extending the financing terms for an additional three months 
in addition  racc agreed to finance two beech aircraft owned by mesa for an amount equal to the monthly payments due on beech d aircraft for the months of august  september and october mesa then used the proceeds of the financing for those monthly payments 
the two aircraft were financed by racc with non recourse  non interest bearing loans and are in the process of being sold 
in september  racc refinanced from another lender an additional beech d aircraft 
the total financing by racc is secured by the aircraft and totals million at september  with monthly payments of million 
in november  racc refinanced from another lender three more beech d aircraft 
in august mesa reached an agreement with racc whereby racc agreed to purchase excess beech aircraft parts from mesa 
as a result of disputes between mesa and racc regarding the applicability and value of certain aircraft parts under the agreement  mesa withheld its monthly payment on beech aircraft to racc for the months of october and november in an agreement dated january   mesa and racc resolved the issues regarding these parts and racc accepted them in lieu of payment for the months of october and november to the extent that any event of default  as defined in the loans  may have occurred for the months of october and november  they have been deemed fully cured pursuant to the terms of the agreement with racc 
future lease payments due under all aircraft operating leases were approximately million at september  in addition  mesa has significant lease obligations on other operating and non operating aircraft 
these leases are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
at september  aircraft were leased by mesa with terms extending through june total lease expense for the twelve months ended september  was million 
mesa has ordered crj aircraft for use in its america west express operation in phoenix  arizona and columbus  ohio  and for its usairways express operations on the east coast 
as of december   mesa had received of the crj aircraft on order and expects to take delivery of the remaining by the end of mesa has options for an additional crj aircraft with a delivery schedule of one per month beginning june the value of these additional crj aircraft  at listed prices  is approximately million 
the expected delivery schedule of aircraft is a forward looking statement  which could significantly differ based on manufacturer s delivery delays  among other factors 
permanent financing has been completed on of these aircraft for which mesa has entered into operating leases 
the manufacturer  bombardier regional aircraft division  is providing interim financing and has agreed to provide back up financing at agreed upon rates if mesa is not successful in obtaining permanent financing 
the rate  but not the commitment  is subject to there being no material adverse change of mesa 
mesa anticipates finalizing operating leases upon the completion of permanent financing for the additional aircraft delivered through december and for the remaining aircraft to be delivered in approximately million was incurred as a one time expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the two fokker aircraft returned by mesa to daimler benz 
mesa currently has offers for various real properties in farmington  new mexico 
the administration building was sold in december and mesa anticipates closing on the revenue accounting and operations buildings in early mesa expects to receive in excess of million from these sales 
mesa is also currently reviewing offers to buy desert turbine services and four corners aviation 
westair ceased operations on may  as a result of the termination of its united express code share agreement 
in november  mesa settled all claims with the aircraft and equipment lessors of westair for approximately million 
westair contributed approximately million of the settlement and mesa approximately million 
mesa anticipates recovering million from westair s receivables and deposits in the future 
westair had operated leased aircraft pursuant to the partnership agreement and upon cessation of united express service had considerable liabilities for the remaining terms of the leases 
mesa worked closely with all lessors to develop and implement a plan that was acceptable to both mesa and the various lessors 
mesa has negotiated year engine maintenance contracts with general electric aircraft engines ge for the crj and with pratt and whitney  canada aircraft services pwc for the dash aircraft 
the ge engine maintenance contract provides coverage for the engines on the first crj aircraft to be delivered 
mesa is presently negotiating with ge to add the crj aircraft engines for additional crj aircraft to this maintenance contract 
the pwc contract provides coverage for all dash aircraft engines operated by mesa 
both contracts provide for payment at the time of the repair event and a fixed dollar amount per flight hour  subject to escalation based on changes in the cpi  for the number of flight hours incurred since the previous event 
in connection with the million loss provision recorded of which million was for the fiscal year ended september  and million was for the year ended september   mesa incurred million in cash expenditures in fiscal primarily for disposition of surplus aircraft  severance and other expenditures 
mesa estimates that the cash expenditures for fiscal year attributable to the remaining costs related to the termination of the united express code share agreements and the shut down of the denver and fort worth operations are approximately million primarily related to aircraft interest and severance costs 
at september   mesa had applied million to this provision  leaving a balance of million for remaining disposition costs 
mesa estimates that the remaining provision will be adequate for the remaining disposition expenses 
mesa s estimation that the remaining provision will be adequate for the remaining disposition expenses is a forward looking statement 
year issues many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept two digits entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in the computer shutting down or performing incorrect computations 
as a result  in less than eleven months  computer systems and software used by many companies will need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
certain of mesa s systems  including information and computer systems and automated equipment  will be affected by the year issue 
mesa has begun to compile a comprehensive inventory of its core business applications to determine the adequacy of these systems to meet future business requirements 
to date  mesa s year remediation efforts have focused on its core business computer applications ie  those systems that mesa is dependent upon for the conduct of day to day business operations 
year readiness is only one of many factors considered in this assessment 
out of this effort  a number of systems have already been identified for upgrade or replacement 
in no case has a system been replaced or contemplated to be replaced solely because of year issues  although in some cases the timing of system replacements is being accelerated 
thus  mesa does not believe the costs of these system replacements are specifically year related 
additionally  while mesa may have incurred an opportunity cost for addressing the year issue  it does not believe that any specific information technology projects have been deferred as a result of its year efforts 
mesa s reservation systems are tied to its code sharing partners  usairways and america west 
mesa representatives have met with the reservation system providers and are engaged in on going dialogue regarding their year progress 
mesa has installed an upgraded version of its current accounting system which is represented by the vendor to be compliant but has not yet been tested 
a new flight operations software package which will handle crew scheduling and dispatch is currently being installed to replace an in house system and is expected to be compliant after implementation of a vendor supplied upgrade 
mesa has had extensive discussions with the manufacturers of its various aircraft to discuss year issues and identify the required avionics and flight systems upgrades which will be implemented during the aircraft manufacturers are also required to report the year status of their aircraft to the faa 
mesa currently has two employees devoted full time to year issues one in information technology and one in the maintenance department 
projects are currently underway to evaluate the remaining systems including tracking of maintenance parts  revenue accounting and payroll and replace them if needed  with implementations and testing scheduled for the remainder of calendar year as with systems that have already been replaced  mesa does not believe the costs of these replacements are specifically year related 
mesa has upgraded or replaced much of its personal computers and related equipment that have embedded software in the last several months 
again  these replacements were not specifically related to year but were part of a larger system upgrade 
mesa has spent approximately million on these upgrades thus far  and anticipates another 
million in expenditures to complete its system upgrade 
mesa expects to incur costs to replace or repair some of its systems  but it has not at this time determined the amount of these costs 
mesa is currently assessing other potential year issues  including non information technology systems 
a broad based year task force is being formed and will began meeting to identify areas of concern and develop action plans 
mesa has also been meeting with similar task forces at america west  usairways  and sabre 
also as part of the task force effort  the company s relationships with vendors  contractors  financial institutions and other third parties will be examined to determine the status of the year issue efforts on the part of the other parties to material relationships 
the year task force will include both internal and company external representation 
mesa expects to incur year specific costs in the future but does not at present anticipate that these costs will be material 
mesa believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for the year issue would be that mesa or the third parties with whom it has relationships would cease or not successfully complete their year remediation efforts 
if this were to occur  mesa would encounter disruptions to its business that could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial position  and results of operations 
mesa could be materially impacted by widespread economic or financial market disruption or by year computer system failures 
mesa has not at this time established a formal year contingency plan but will consider and  if necessary  address doing so as part of its year task force activities 
mesa maintains and deploys contingency plans designed to address various other potential business interruptions 
these plans may be applicable to address the interruption of support provided by third parties resulting from their failure to be year ready 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued several new pronouncements that are not yet adopted by mesa 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  to establish standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners and its components in financial statements 
this new standard  which will be effective for mesa for the fiscal year ended september   is not currently expected to have a material impact on mesa s consolidated financial statements based on the current financial structure and operations of mesa 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  to establish standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements  selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports and disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
this new standard  which will be effective for mesa for the fiscal year ending september   will require mesa to report financial information on the basis that is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments  which is currently anticipated to result in more detailed information in the notes to mesa s consolidated financial statements than is currently required and provided 
forward looking statements this form k contains certain statements including  but not limited to  information regarding the replacement  deployment  and acquisition of certain numbers and types of aircraft  and projected expenses associated therewith  costs of compliance with faa regulations and other rules and acts of congress  the passing of taxes  fuel costs  inflation  and various expenses to the consumer  the relocation of certain operations of mesa  the resolution of litigation in a favorable manner  compliance with year issues  and certain projected financial obligations
