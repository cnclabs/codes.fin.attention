interest income 
interest income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to the higher cash and cash equivalent balances from the company s equity offerings 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company received net proceeds of approximately  from an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock and approximately  from a concurrent private placement to medtronic  inc of  shares of its common stock 
also on march   all outstanding shares of the company s preferred stock were automatically converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock following the for reverse stock split 
the company s operations since inception have been primarily funded by net proceeds from the sales of common and preferred stock totaling approximately  through december  as of december  and december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company used  for operations and  for capital expenditures 
of the capital expenditures  was financed through capital leases 
the company has recently announced a financing agreement with medtronic  inc under the agreement  the company will receive million from medtronic asset management  which is repayable by or  if earlier  at the close of a significant round of debt or equity financing 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  with the addition of the medtronic financing  will be sufficient to fund the operations of the company through at least the next months 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of regulatory actions regarding the company s products  the results of clinical trials and competition  the extent to which the company s ensite system gains market acceptance and the costs and timing of expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities 
year many currently installed computer systems and software are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code fields 
these date code field will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates 
this problem could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of business operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in other similar business activities 
as a result  many companies computer systems and software will need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with year requirements 
the potential global impact of the year problem is not known  and if not corrected in a timely manner  could affect the company and the us and world economy generally 
the company has formed a project team consisting of representatives from its information technology  finance  manufacturing  product development and quality department to address internal and external year issues 
the company s internal financial  manufacturing and other operational computer systems have been upgraded to address year issues 
management believes that the new software substantially addresses year issues 
the company believes it has completed its year compliance program for all of its significant internal financial and manufacturing systems 
the company may be required  however  to make minor modification to some of its existing hardware as well as various product development software packages in order for its computer system to function properly in the year and thereafter 
the company is currently assessing both of these areas and expects to complete this assessment in the first quarter the company s product development processes will contain steps to include year compliance verification for all current and future products 
the company believes that the ensite system is year compliant because it operates on a unix operating system which should be unaffected by the year issue 
the company is currently completing validation testing for its products and expects to complete its year compliance testing for its products during the first quarter in addition  the company has received assurances from its major suppliers that they are addressing the year issue and that product purchased by the company from such suppliers will function properly in the year these actions are intended to help mitigate the possible external impact of the year problem 
even assuming that all material third parties confirm that they are or expect to be year compliant by december   it is not possible to state with certainty that such parties will be so compliant 
it is impossible to fully assess the potential consequences in the event service interruptions from suppliers occur or in the event that there are disruptions in infrastructure areas as utilities  communication  transportation  banking and government 
the amount of remediation work required to address year problems is not expected to be extensive and the total estimated cost for resolving the company s year issues is minimal and not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company expects the remainder of the year compliance program to be substantially complete by second quarter based on the company s assessment to date  the company believes it will not experience any material disruption as a result of year problems in its financial  internal manufacturing processes or the ensite system 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be converted in a timely manner  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has not yet developed a contingency plan to provide for continuity of processing in such event of various problem scenarios  but it will assess the need to develop such a plan based on the outcome of its validation phase of its year compliance program and the results of surveying it major suppliers 
assuming no major disruption in service from utility companies or other critical third party providers  the company believes that it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that unexpected difficulties will not arise and  if so  that the company will be able to timely develop and implement a contingency plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had approximately million of cash and investments on december  substantially all of the investments were us government or investment grade  fixed income securities from domestic issuers 
because of the credit risk criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of the company s investments  however  because management considers it unlikely that the company would need or choose to substantially liquidate the company s investments  management believes that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
even though the company distributes products abroad  the company does not conduct sales in foreign currencies 
therefore  management does not believe the company is exposed to any material foreign currency exchange rate risk
