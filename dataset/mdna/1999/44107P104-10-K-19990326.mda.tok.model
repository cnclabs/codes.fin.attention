item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition lack of comparability following the reit conversion because substantially all of our hotels are leased due to the reit conversion  we do not believe that the historical results of operations are comparable to what our results of operations following the reit conversion 
therefore  in addition to the historical presentation  we have presented a discussion of the results of operation on a pro forma basis as if the reit conversion had occurred on the first day of each respective year 
results of operations our historic revenues primarily represent gross property level sales from our hotels  net gains losses on property transactions and equity in the earnings of affiliates 
on november   the emerging issues task force or eitf of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on eitf  application of fasb statement no 
and apb opinion no 
to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with contractual management arrangements 
eitf addresses the circumstances in which a management entity may include the revenues and expenses of a managed entity in its financial statements 
we considered the impact of eitf on our financial statements and determined that eitf required us to include property level sales and operating expenses of our hotels in the statements of operations 
we have given retroactive effect to the adoption of eitf in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
application of eitf to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   january  and january  increased both revenues and operating expenses by approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  and had no impact on operating profit  net income or earnings per share 
our hotel operating costs and expenses have been  to a great extent  fixed 
therefore  we have derived substantial operating leverage from increases in revenue 
this operating leverage was somewhat diluted  however  by the impact of base management fees which were calculated as a percentage of sales  variable ground lease payments and incentive management fees tied to operating performance above certain established levels 
successful hotel performance resulted in certain of our properties reaching levels which allowed the manager to share in the growth of profits in the form of higher management fees 
for the periods discussed below  our hotel properties experienced substantial increases in revpar 
revpar is a commonly used indicator of market performance for hotels which represents the combination of the average daily room rate charged and the average occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include food and beverage or other ancillary revenues generated by the property 
the revpar increase primarily reflects strong percentage increases in room rates  while occupancy increases have been more moderate 
increases in average room rates have generally been achieved by the managers through shifting occupancies away from discounted group business to higher rated group and transient business and by selectively increasing room rates 
this has been made possible by increased travel due to improved economic conditions and by the favorable supply demand characteristics existing in the upscale and luxury full service segments of the lodging industry 
compared to historical revenues 
revenues increased billion  or  to billion for from billion for our revenue and operating profit were impacted by improved results for comparable full service hotel properties  the addition of full service hotel properties during and full service hotel properties during and the gain on the sale of two hotel properties in hotel sales  which are gross hotel sales  including room sales  food and beverage sales  and other ancillary sales such as telephone sales  increased billion  or  to over billion in  reflecting the revpar increases for comparable units and the addition of full service hotels in and improved results for our full service hotels were driven by strong increases in revpar for our comparable units of to for results were further enhanced by approximately one percentage point increase in the house profit margin for comparable full service properties 
average room rates increased nearly for our comparable full service hotels

as a result of the reit conversion  we are required to use available funds to pay dividends to the extent of of taxable income in order to maintain our reit qualification  and we have indicated an intent to pay dividends equivalent to of taxable income for each year 
payment of these dividends is expected to be funded by the operating partnership 
to the extent that the operating partnership s cash flow is not sufficient for this purpose  it may be required to borrow money to pay such dividends 
capital transactions 
we substantially changed our debt financing through the following series of transactions which were intended to facilitate the consummation of the reit conversion 
on april   we and certain of our subsidiaries filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for billion in securities  including debt  equity or any combination thereof 
hmh properties  inc  then our wholly owned subsidiary utilized billion of the capacity under this shelf registration to issue the new senior notes described further below 
on august   hmh properties  which was merged into the operating partnership as part of the reit conversion  purchased substantially all of its i million of senior notes due  ii million of senior notes due and iii million of senior notes due concurrently with each offer to purchase  hmh properties solicited consents from registered holders of these old senior notes to certain amendments to eliminate or modify substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain other provisions contained in the indentures pursuant to which the old senior notes were issued 
hmh properties simultaneously utilized the shelf registration to issue an aggregate of billion in new senior notes  in two series million of series a notes due in and billion of series b notes due in the august consent solicitations facilitated the merger of hmc capital resources holdings corporation  then our wholly owned subsidiary  with and into hmh properties 
hmc capital resources  the owner of eight of our hotel properties  was the obligor under our old million revolving credit facility 
in august  hmh properties entered into a new billion credit facility with a group of commercial banks  which replaced the old credit facility 
the credit facility provides i a million term loan facility  subject to certain increases  and ii a million revolving credit facility 
the new credit facility has an initial three year term with two one year extension options 
borrowings under the new credit facility generally bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus at december  and the interest rate and commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility fluctuate based on certain financial ratios 
as of december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
the net proceeds from the offering of the billion senior notes and borrowings under the credit facility were used to purchase substantially all of hmh properties old senior notes  to repay amounts outstanding under the old credit facility and to make bond premium and consent payments totaling million 
these costs  along with the write off of deferred financing fees of approximately million related to the old senior notes and the old credit facility  were recorded as a pre tax extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt in in december  hmh properties issued million of series c senior notes due in under the same indenture and with the same covenants as the series a and series b senior notes previously issued 
the proceeds were used to pay down other debt and pay expenses of the reit conversion 
hmh properties had a total of billion in senior notes outstanding as of its merger with the operating partnership on december  these senior notes  and obligations under the new credit facility  became obligations of the operating partnership at that time 
in february  the operating partnership issued million of series d senior notes due in under the same indenture and with the same covenants as the new senior notes and series c senior notes 
the debt was used to refinance  or purchase  approximately million of debt acquired in the partnership mergers  including approximately million of other mortgage debt 
in july  hmh properties and hmc acquisition properties  inc each of which is our wholly owned subsidiary  completed consent solicitations with holders of their senior notes to amend certain provisions of their senior notes indentures 
the consent solicitations facilitated the merger of acquisitions with and into hmh properties 
concurrent with the consent solicitations and the hmh properties and acquisitions merger  hmh properties issued an aggregate of million of senior notes at par with a maturity of july hmh properties received net proceeds of approximately million  net of the costs of the consent solicitations and the offering 
hmh properties paid dividends to host marriott of million and million in and  respectively  as permitted under the indentures 
no dividends were paid in in addition to the capital resources provided by its debt financings  in december host marriott financial trust  one of our wholly owned subsidiary trusts  issued million shares of convertible quarterly income preferred securities  with a liquidation preference of per share for a total liquidation amount of million 
the convertible preferred securities represent an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the trust and  pursuant to various agreements entered into in connection with the transaction  are fully  irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by us 
proceeds from the issuance of the convertible preferred securities were invested in convertible subordinated debentures due december  issued by us  which are the trust s sole assets 
each of the convertible preferred securities is convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at the rate of shares per convertible preferred security equivalent to a conversion price of per share of our common stock 
this conversion ratio includes adjustments to reflect distributions made to our common stockholders in connection with the reit conversion 
during  and  no shares were converted into common stock 
holders of the convertible preferred securities are entitled to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of accruing from the original issue date  commencing march   and payable quarterly in arrears thereafter 
the distribution rate and the distribution and other payment dates for the convertible preferred securities correspond to the interest rate and interest and other payment dates on the convertible subordinated debentures 
we may defer interest payments on the convertible subordinated debentures for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
if interest payments on the convertible subordinated debentures are deferred  so too are payments on the convertible preferred securities 
under this circumstance  we would not be permitted to declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to our capital stock or debt securities that rank equal in right of payment with or junior to the convertible subordinated debentures 
subject to certain restrictions  the convertible preferred securities are redeemable at our option upon any redemption of the convertible subordinated debentures after december  upon repayment at maturity or as a result of the acceleration of the convertible subordinated debentures upon the occurrence of a default  the convertible preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption 
we may  from time to time  make market repurchases of these securities as conditions permit 
in connection with consummation of the reit conversion  the operating partnership assumed primary liability for repayment of the convertible subordinated debentures  although we also retain liability 
upon conversion by a convertible preferred securities holder  we will issue shares of our common stock  which will be delivered to such holder 
upon the issuance of such shares by host marriott  the operating partnership will issue to us a number of op units equal to the number of shares of our common stock issued in exchange for the debentures 
in march  we completed the issuance of million shares of common stock for net proceeds of nearly million 
capital acquisitions  additions and improvements 
we seek to grow primarily through opportunistic acquisitions of full service hotels 
we believe that the upscale and luxury full service hotel segments of the market offer opportunities to acquire assets at attractive multiples of cash flow and at discounts to replacement value  including under performing hotels which may be improved by conversion to the marriott or ritz carlton brands 
in the first quarter of  we acquired a controlling interest in the partnership that owns the  room atlanta marriott marquis hotel for million  including the assumption of million of mortgage debt 
we also acquired a controlling interest in the partnership that owns the room albany marriott  the room san diego marriott mission valley and the room minneapolis marriott southwest for approximately million 
in the second quarter of  we acquired the room park ridge marriott for million and acquired the room ritz carlton  phoenix for million 
in addition  we acquired the room ritz carlton  tysons corner  virginia for million and the room torrance marriott near los angeles  california  for million 
in the third quarter of  we acquired the room ritz carlton  dearborn for approximately million  the room ritz carlton  san francisco for approximately million and the room memphis crowne plaza which was converted to the marriott brand upon acquisition for approximately million 
we are regularly engaged in discussions with respect to other potential acquisition properties 
in december  we completed the acquisition of  or controlling interests in  twelve world class luxury hotels and certain other assets  including a mortgage note on a thirteenth hotel property from affiliates of the blackstone group 
the operating partnership paid approximately million in cash and assumed debt and issued approximately million op units  along with other consideration for a total value of approximately billion 
the number of op units issued in the blackstone acquisition will fluctuate based upon certain closing adjustments to be determined on march  based on current stock prices  the operating partnership will be required to issue the blackstone entities approximately million additional op units pursuant to such adjustments in april in december  subsidiaries of the operating partnership merged with eight public partnerships and acquired limited partnership interests in four private partnerships  which collectively own or control properties of which were controlled by us and consolidated on our financial statements prior to december the operating partnership issued approximately million op units  million of which were subsequently converted to our common stock  for interests in these partnerships valued at approximately million 
as a result of these transactions  the operating partnership increased its ownership of most of the properties to while consolidating additional hotels  rooms 
in connection with our conversion to a reit  we formed two non controlled subsidiaries  which own approximately million in assets 
the ownership of most of these assets by us and the operating partnership could jeopardize our status as a reit and the operating partnership s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
these assets primarily consist of partnership or other interests in hotels which are not leased and certain furniture  fixtures and equipment used in the hotels 
in exchange for the operating partnership s contribution of these assets to the non controlled subsidiaries  the operating partnership received only nonvoting common stock representing of the total economic interests of the non controlled subsidiaries 
the host marriott statutory employee charitable trust  the beneficiaries of which are a trust formed for the benefit of certain employees of the operating partnership and the j 
willard marriott foundation  acquired all of the voting common stock representing the remaining of the total economic interests  and reflecting of the control of each non controlled subsidiary 
as a result  as of december   we did not control the non controlled subsidiaries 
during  we acquired eight full service hotels  rooms and controlling interests in nine additional full service hotels  rooms for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million including the assumption of approximately million of debt 
we also completed the acquisition of the room new york marriott financial center  after acquiring the mortgage on the hotel for million in late during  we acquired six full service hotels  rooms for an aggregate purchase price of million and controlling interests in additional full service properties  rooms for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion including the assumption of million of debt 
in november  we announced a committment to develop and construct the room tampa convention center marriott for a cost estimated at approximately million  net of an approximate million subsidy provided by the city of tampa 
we may also expand existing hotel properties where strong performance and market demand exists 
expansions to existing properties create a lower risk to us as the success of the market is generally known and development time is significantly shorter than new construction 
we recently committed to add approximately rooms and an additional  square feet of meeting space to the  room marriott s orlando world center 
in july  we announced the purchase of a acre parcel of land for the development of a room ritz carlton that will serve as an extension of the room ritz carlton naples  which was purchased in september the existing hotel just completed a restaurant and public space refurbishment and is in the process of adding a world class spa 
in addition  a subsidiary of one of the non controlled subsidiaries entered into a joint venture through which a non controlled subsidiary owns of the surrounding hole world class greg norman designed golf course development 
the golf course joint venture was transferred to a non controlled subsidiary in connection with the reit conversion 
the total investment by us in expansion and investments in the ritz carlton  naples property is expected to be approximately million 
in  we acquired the outstanding common stock of the forum group from marriott senior living services  inc  a subsidiary of marriott international 
we purchased the forum group portfolio of senior living communities for approximately million  including approximately million in debt 
additionally  during and  we completed certain expansions and acquired two additional senior living properties for million  including million of debt 
the properties  which continued to be operated by marriott international were owned by a subsidiary of crestline and distributed to our shareholders in connection with the reit conversion and are reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
in december  we discontinued the senior living business as a result of the distribution of the crestline common stock to our shareholders 
asset dispositions 
we historically have disposed of  and may from time to time in the future consider opportunities to sell or exchange  real estate properties at attractive valuations when the proceeds could be redeployed into investments with more favorable returns 
during the second quarter of  we disposed of the room new york marriott east side for proceeds of million and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million and the napa valley marriott for proceeds of million and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million 
during  we disposed of the room sheraton elk grove suites for proceeds of approximately million 
we also sold of an acre parcel of undeveloped land in germantown  maryland for approximately million  which approximated its carrying value 
during the first and second quarters of  of our courtyard properties and of our residence inn properties were sold  subject to a leaseback  to hospitality properties trust for approximately million  with approximately million to be received upon expiration of the leases 
a gain on the transactions of approximately million was deferred and is being amortized over the initial term of the leases 
in february  we disposed of the minneapolis bloomington marriott for million and recorded a pre tax gain on sale of approximately million 
in cases where we have made a decision to dispose of particular properties  we assess impairment of each individual property to be sold on the basis of expected sales price less estimated costs of disposal 
otherwise  we assess impairment of our real estate properties based on whether it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows from such properties will be less than their net book value 
if a property is impaired  its basis is adjusted to its fair market value 
cash flows 
our cash flow from continuing operations in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
cash flow from used in discontinued operations totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively

comparative ffo 
management believes that comparative funds from operations or comparative ffo  which represents funds from operations  as defined by nareit  plus deferred tax expense  is a meaningful disclosure that will help the investment community to better understand our financial performance 
ffo is meaningful due to the significance of our long lived assets and because such data is considered useful by the investment community to better understand our results  and can be used to measure our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand its business 
ffo is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash flows from operations or any other operating or liquidity performance measure prescribed by gaap 
ffo is also not an indicator of funds available for our cash needs  including distributions 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  is not comparable to such other reits

we consider ebitda and comparative ffo to be indicative measures of our operating performance due to the significance of our long lived assets and because such data is considered useful by the investment community to better understand our results  and can be used to measure our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand its business  however  such information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating or liquidity performance measure prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles 
cash expenditures for various long term assets  interest expense for ebitda purposes only and income taxes have been  and will be  incurred which are not reflected in the ebitda and comparative ffo presentation 
partnership activities 
prior to the reit conversion  we had general and limited partner interests in numerous limited partnerships which owned hotels including full service hotels  managed by marriott international 
debt of the hotel limited partnerships was typically secured by first mortgages on the properties and was generally nonrecourse to the limited partnerships and their partners 
however  we committed to advance amounts to certain affiliated limited partnerships  if necessary  to cover certain future debt service requirements  these commitments now have been assumed by the operating partnership 
these commitments are limited  in the aggregate  to million 
amounts repaid to us under these guarantees totaled million and million in and  respectively 
fundings by us under these guarantees amounted to million in there were no fundings in or as a result of the reit conversion  our interests in the limited service hotels were transferred to the non controlled subsidiaries 
additionally  as part of the reit conversion  of the full service hotels were acquired by the operating partnership  two were sold  four were transferred to one of the non controlled subsidiaries and one was retained by us 
leases 
we lease certain property and equipment under noncancelable operating leases  including the long term ground leases for certain hotels  generally with multiple renewal options 
the leases related to the courtyard properties and residence inn properties sold during and  are nonrecourse to us and contain provisions for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts 
we remain contingently liable on certain leases related to divested non lodging properties 
such contingent liabilities aggregated million at december  however  management considers the likelihood of any substantial funding related to these divested properties leases to be remote 
inflation 
our hotel lodging properties have been impacted by inflation through its effect on increasing costs and on the managers ability to increase room rates 
unlike other real estate  hotels have the ability to change room rates on a daily basis  so the impact of higher inflation generally can be passed on to customers 
our exposure to inflation is less now that substantially all of our hotels are leased to others 
a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at fixed rates 
this debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in the rate of inflation on future interest costs 
however  we are currently exposed to some variable interest rate debt  whose market risk is hedged through interest rate exchange agreements with financial institutions with an aggregate notional amount of million 
under the agreements  we collect interest based on one month libor rate of at december  and pay interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
the agreements expire between august and august accordingly  the amount of our interest expense under the interest rate exchange agreements and the floating rate debt for a particular year will be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
year issue year issues have arisen because many existing computer programs and chip based embedded technology systems use only the last two digits to refer to a year  and therefore do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the following disclosure provides information regarding the current status of our year compliance program 
we have adopted the compliance program because we recognize the importance of minimizing the number and seriousness of any disruptions that may occur as a result of the year issue 
our compliance program includes an assessment of our hardware and software computer systems and embedded systems  as well as an assessment of the year issues relating to third parties with which we have a material relationship or whose systems are material to the operations of our hotel properties 
our efforts to ensure that our computer systems are year compliant have been segregated into two separate phases in house systems and third party systems 
following the reit conversion  crestline  as the lessee of most of our hotels  will deal directly with year matters material to the operation of the hotels  and crestline has agreed to adopt and implement the program outlined below with respect to third party systems for all hotels for which it is the lessee 
in house systems 
since the distribution of marriott international on october   we have invested in the implementation and maintenance of accounting and reporting systems and equipment that are intended to enable us to provide adequately for our information and reporting needs and which are also year compliant 
substantially all of our in house systems have already been certified as year compliant through testing and other mechanisms and we have not delayed any systems projects due to the year issue 
we are in the process of engaging a third party to review our year in house compliance 
management believes that future costs associated with year issues for our in house systems will be insignificant and therefore not impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have not developed  and do not plan to develop  a separate contingency plan for our in house systems due to their current year compliance 
third party systems 
we rely upon operational and accounting systems provided by third parties  primarily the managers and operators of our hotel properties  to provide the appropriate property specific operating systems  including reservation  phone  elevator  security  hvac and other systems  and to provide us with financial information 
based on discussion with the third parties that are critical to our business  including the managers and operators of our hotels  we believe that these parties are in the process of studying their systems and the systems of their respective vendors and service providers and  in many cases  have begun to implement changes  to ensure that they are year compliant 
however  we have not received any oral or written assurances that these third parties will be year compliant on time 
to the extent these changes impact property level systems  we may be required to fund capital expenditures for upgraded equipment and software 
we do not expect these charges to be material  but we are committed to making these investments as required 
to the extent that these changes relate to a third party manager s centralized systems  including reservations  accounting  purchasing  inventory  personnel and other systems  management agreements generally provide for these costs to be charged to our properties subject to annual limitations  which costs will be borne by crestline under the leases 
we expect that the third party managers will incur year costs in lieu of costs for their centralized systems related to systems projects that otherwise would have been pursued and  therefore  the overall level of centralized systems charges allocated to the properties will not materially increase as a result of the year compliance effort 
we believe that this deferral of certain systems projects will not have a material impact on our future results of operations  although it may delay certain productivity enhancements at our properties 
we and crestline will continue to monitor the efforts of these third parties to become year compliant and will take appropriate steps to address any non compliance issues 
we believe that  in the event of material year non compliance  we will have the right to seek recourse against the manager under our third party management agreements 
the management agreements  however  generally do not specifically address the year compliance issue 
therefore  the amount of any recovery in the event of year non compliance at a property  if any  is not determinable at this time  and only a portion of such recovery would accrue to us through increased lease rental payments from crestline 
we and crestline will work with the third parties to ensure that appropriate contingency plans will be developed to address the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios  which may not have been identified fully 
in particular  we and crestline have had extensive discussions regarding the year problem with marriott international  the manager of a substantial majority of our hotel properties 
due to the significance of marriott international to our business  a detailed description of marriott international s state of readiness follows 
marriott international has adopted an eight step process toward year readiness  consisting of the following awareness fostering understanding of  and commitment to  the problem and its potential risks  inventory identifying and locating systems and technology components that may be affected  assessment reviewing these components for year compliance  and assessing the scope of year issues  planning defining the technical solutions and labor and work plans necessary for each affected system  remediation replacement completing the programming to renovate or replace the problem software or hardware  testing and compliance validation conducting testing  followed by independent validation by a separate internal verification team  implementation placing the corrected systems and technology back into the business environment  and quality assurance utilizing an internal audit team to review significant projects for adherence to quality standards and program methodology 
marriott international has grouped its systems and technology into three categories for purposes of year compliance i information resource applications and technology it applications enterprise wide systems supported by marriott international s centralized information technology organization ir  ii business initiated systems bis systems that have been initiated by an individual business unit  and that are not supported by marriott international s ir organization  and iii building systems non it equipment at properties that use embedded computer chips  such as elevators  automated room key systems and hvac equipment 
marriott international is prioritizing its efforts based on how severe an effect noncompliance would have on customer service  core business processes or revenues  and whether there are viable  non automated fallback procedures system criticality 
marriott international measures the completion of each phase based on documented and quantified results  weighted for system criticality 
as of january   the awareness and inventory phases were complete for it applications and substantially complete for bis and building systems 
for it applications  the assessment  planning remediation replacement and testing phases were each over percent complete  and compliance validation had been completed for nearly half of key systems  with most of the remaining work in its final stage 
bis and building systems  assessment and planning are nearly complete 
remediation replacement and testing is percent complete for bis  and marriott international is on track for completion of initial testing of building systems by the end of the first quarter of compliance validation is in progress for both bis and building systems 
marriott international remains on target for substantial completion of remediation replacement and testing for system critical bis and building systems by june and september  respectively 
quality assurance is in progress for it applications  bis and building systems 
year compliance communications with marriott international s significant third party suppliers  vendors and business partners  including its franchisees are ongoing 
marriott international s efforts are focused on the connections most critical to customer service  core business processes and revenues  including those third parties that support the most critical enterprise wide it applications  franchisees generating the most revenues  suppliers of the most widely used building systems and bis  the top suppliers  by dollar volume  of non it products  and financial institutions providing the most critical payment processing functions 
responses have been received from a majority of the firms in this group 
a majority of these respondents have either given assurances of timely year compliance or have identified the necessary actions to be taken by them or marriott international to achieve timely year compliance for their products 
marriott international has established a common approach for testing and addressing year compliance issues for its managed and franchised properties 
this includes a guidance protocol for operated properties  and a year toolkit for franchisees containing relevant year compliance information 
marriott international is also utilizing a year best practices sharing system 
risks 
there can be no assurances that year remediation by us or third parties will be properly and timely completed  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us  our business and our financial condition 
we cannot predict the actual effects to us of the year problem  which depend on numerous uncertainties such as whether significant third parties properly and timely address the year issue and whether broad based or systemic economic failures occur 
moreover  we are reliant upon crestline to interface with third parties in addressing the year issue at the hotels leased by crestline 
we are also unable to predict the severity and duration of any such failures  which could include disruptions in passenger transportation or transportation systems generally  loss of utility and or telecommunications services  the loss or disruption of hotel reservations made on centralized reservation systems and errors or failures in financial transactions or payment processing systems such as credit cards 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem and our dependence on third parties  including crestline  we are unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on us 
our year compliance program  and crestline s adoption thereof  are expected to significantly reduce the level of uncertainty about the year problem and management believes that the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
accounting standards 
in the fourth quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
during  we adopted sfas no 
 earnings per share  sfas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the adoption of these statements did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and the appropriate disclosures required by these statements have been incorporated herein 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income which establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
sfas requires unrealized gains or losses on our right to receive host marriott services corporation stock and foreign currency translation adjustments  to be included in other comprehensive income 
for and  our other comprehensive income loss was million and million  respectively 
as of december  and january   our accumulated other comprehensive income loss was approximately million and million  respectively 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we have not determined the impact of sfas no 
 but we do not believe it will be material 
on november   the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus of eitf  application of fasb statement no 
and apb opinion no 
to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with contractual management arrangements 
eitf addresses the circumstances in which a management entity may include the revenues and expenses of a managed entity in its financial statements 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  we have adopted eitf in the fourth quarter of with retroactive effect in prior periods to conform to the new presentation 
application of eitf to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years  and increased both revenues and operating expenses by approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  and had no impact on operating profit  net income or earnings per share 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
as of december   the change in current yields between one year and five year us treasury bonds is three basis points  thus  minimal fluctuations in the average interest rates are anticipated over the maturity periods
