all forward looking statements included in this document are based on the information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed herein 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenue  consolidated statements of income data for the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenue product maintenance and service total revenue costs and expenses cost of product revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative non recurring charges total costs and expenses income from operations interest income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenue total revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop the company derives revenue from the sale of software licenses  post contract support support and other services 
support includes telephone technical support  bug fixes  and rights to upgrades on a when and if available basis 
services range from installation  training  and basic consulting for software modification to meet specific customer needs 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products  specified upgrades  support and or other services  the company allocates the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each of the deliverables determined based on vendor specific objective evidence 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue on arrangements with customers who are not the ultimate end users primarily resellers is not recognized until the product is delivered to the end user 
revenue allocable to support is recognized on a straight line basis over the period support is provided 
arrangements that include other software services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
when services are considered essential  revenue under the arrangement is recognized using contract accounting 
when services are not considered essential  the revenue allocable to the software services is recognized as the services are performed 
the company distributes the majority of its products through its headquarters based direct sales organization which is complemented by indirect sales channels  including value added resellers vars  system integrators sis and independent software vendors isvs 
sales derived through indirect channels accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue in as compared to in the company expects that sales derived through indirect channels will increase 
international sales accounted for of total revenue in and of total revenue in both and international sales are denominated and collected in us currency 
the majority of international sales were made in europe  with lower amounts in canada  the pacific rim and latin america 
currently the company maintains offices in the united kingdom  france  germany  singapore  australia  japan and canada 
in october  the company set up remedy software international limited rsil in ireland 
from this location  the company ships its products to customers in europe  the middle east and africa 
the company also expects to increase the staffing levels of its international based operations in because a substantial majority of the company s international sales are indirect  any material increase in the company s international sales as a percentage of total revenue may adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit prices that the company receives when selling through indirect channels 
although the company s international revenue is currently not at risk for currency fluctuations because such sales are currently denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in those markets 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities 
in the future  some portion of the company s revenues may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars and  as a result  the company may in the future engage in minimal hedging activities 
if any revenues are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  the company will be subject to the risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  due to the substantial volatility of foreign exchange rates  the company s business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
product revenue 
the company currently derives substantially all of its product revenue from licenses of the ar system 
revenue from product licenses was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
this represents increases of from to and from to the growth of revenue in absolute dollars is largely a result of the company s sales and marketing efforts and the increased acceptance of the ar system 
the prices of the company s products have remained relatively constant in the periods presented 
the company intends to continue to enhance its current software products as well as to develop new products 
as a result  the company anticipates that revenue from product licenses will continue to represent a substantial majority of its revenue in the foreseeable future 
maintenance and service revenue 
maintenance and service revenue was million  million  million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to this growth is primarily due to the renewal of maintenance contracts after the initial one year term 
although prior years licensing growth has resulted in increased revenue from maintenance and support  training and consulting services  the company expects that prior growth rates of the company s installed base and  consequently  in the company s service revenue  may not be sustainable in the future 
cost and expenses cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of the costs of royalties paid to third party vendors  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials  personnel related costs and shipping expenses 
cost of product revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing of the related product revenue for and  and in the increases in the dollar amount of cost of product revenue in each successive year reflect the higher volumes of product shipped in each year 
the decrease in costs as a percentage of the related product revenue from to was primarily due to economies of scale realized as a result of shipping greater quantities of product in and because all development costs incurred in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing software products have been expensed as incurred  cost of product revenue includes no amortization of capitalized software development costs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of maintenance and service revenue 
cost of maintenance and service revenue consists primarily of personnel related costs incurred in providing telephone support  consulting services and training to customers 
cost of maintenance and service revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing of the related maintenance and service revenue for and  and in the increases in the dollar amounts of cost of maintenance and service since are a result of increased personnel related costs  as the company continued to build its customer support and training organizations 
the company believes that cost of maintenance and service revenue will continue to increase in dollar amounts 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million or of total revenue in and of total revenue in both and the increases in research and development expenses in both absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily attributable to increased staffing  outside contractors and associated support for software engineers required to expand and enhance the company s product line 
the company believes that research and development expenses will continue to increase in dollar amounts in the future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses for sales and marketing personnel  as well as promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million million and million  or  and of total revenue  in  and  respectively 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses in both absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily due to the expansion of sales and marketing resources and increased marketing activities  including trade shows and promotional activities 
the company believes that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in dollar amounts in the future as the company expands its sales and marketing staff 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million or of total revenue in and and of total revenue in the increases in dollar amounts were primarily the result of increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support the company s growth 
the company believes that its general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amounts in the future as the company expands its staffing 
non recurring charges 
in october  the company acquired baystone software baystone  a privately held provider of a suite of customer support  quality assurance  and opportunity management and telesales automation applications for rapidly growing businesses 
the purchase price for baystone approximated million  which consisted of million of cash and million assumption of net liabilities and other direct costs 
the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired 
a total of million was expensed in the company s final fiscal quarter of this was comprised of purchased in process research and development of million and approximately million in other merger related expenses  including million for subsequent personnel severance and outplacement expenses and million for other indirect costs of the acquisition 
purchased in process research and development of million was recorded representing the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which  at the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the amount allocated to goodwill million is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of four years from the date of the acquisition 
a total of million has been amortized as of december  pro forma results of operations have not been presented since the effect of this acquisition was not material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to the investment of increased amounts of cash provided by operating activities 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the years ended december   and was 
the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  offset by tax exempt interest income and research and development tax credits 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively  of which net income was a significant component in each year 
in all three years  cash from operations was used to support the company s working capital requirements  as such requirements expanded  and in all three years the company experienced significant growth in receivables  accompanying the company s increased sales volumes  partially offset by growth in deferred revenue balances 
on august   the board of directors authorized management of the company to repurchase up to million shares or approximately percent of the company s outstanding shares of common stock over the next twelve months 
the company plans to purchase the shares on the open market from time to time  depending on market conditions 
the repurchases will be funded from the company s cash and short term investments 
at december   the company had repurchased a total of approximately million shares of the company s stock at an average price of for approximately million 
the company s investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of short term investments  goodwill related to the acquisition of baystone software and property and equipment 
purchases of short term investments exceeded maturities by million 
to date the company has not invested in derivative securities or any other financial instruments that involve a high level of complexity or risk 
management expects that  in the future  cash in excess of current requirements will continue to be invested in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
in  million of the investing activity represented the acquisition of baystone software 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash used to purchase property and equipment  primarily computer workstations and file servers for the company s growing employee base was million in and and million in the company expects that the rate of purchases of property and equipment will remain constant or increase as the company s employee base grows 
the company s principal commitments consist primarily of leases on its headquarters facilities and on its telephone system 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the net cash used in financing activities in was million in contrast to the million and the million provided by investing activities in and  respectively 
this comparative decrease is primarily due to the use of approximately million as part of the company s initial purchase of million shares of the company s stock under the share repurchase program 
the board of directors has authorized management to repurchase up to million shares through july see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of working capital 
the company also has available a million unsecured bank line of credit which expires in june there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit as of december  the company believes that its current cash and short term investment balances  cash available under its line of credit and cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent the company experiences growth in the future  the company anticipates that its operating and investing activities may use cash 
consequently  significant future growth may require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that  in the event that additional financing is required  the company will be able to raise such additional financing on acceptable terms or at all 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity sfas  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the statement permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter 
the company has yet to determine its date of adoption 
the statement will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
management has not yet determined what the effect of sfas will be on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the aicpa issued sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop no 
requires entities to capitalize certain costs related to internal use software once certain criteria have been met 
management expects that the adoption of sop no 
will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
remedy will be required to implement sop no 
for the year ending december  in april  the aicpa issued sop no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop no 
requires that all start up costs related to new operations must be expensed as incurred 
in addition  all start up costs that were capitalized in the past must be written off when sop no 
is adopted 
management expects that the adoption of sop will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
remedy will be required to implement sop no 
for the year ending december sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions was issued in december and addresses software revenue recognition as it applies to certain multiple element arrangements 
sop also amends sop  deferral of the effective date of a position of sop  to extend the deferral of application of certain passages of sop through fiscal years beginning on or before march  all other provisions of sop are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after march  remedy has not yet determined the effect of the final adoption of sop on its future revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk potential fluctuations in quarterly results  seasonality 
the company s quarterly operating results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as increased competition  the timing of new product announcements and changes in pricing policies by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  the size and timing of significant orders  the mix of direct and indirect sales  changes in operating expenses  changes in company strategy  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and general economic factors 
the company operates with no significant order backlog because its software products typically are shipped or electronically downloaded over the web shortly after orders are received 
furthermore  the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter  with this revenue frequently concentrated in the last weeks of a quarter 
as a result  product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
product revenue is also difficult to forecast because the market for client server and web based application software products is rapidly evolving  and the company s sales cycle  from initial trial to multiple copy purchases and the provision of support services  varies substantially from customer to customer 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenue 
if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results are likely to be adversely affected 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue because a proportionately smaller amount of the company s expenses varies with its revenue 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience a level of seasonality  in part due to customer buying patterns 
in recent years  the company has generally had weaker demand in the quarter ending in march 
the company believes this pattern will continue and accordingly anticipates total revenue and net income in the quarter ending march  will be lower than in the quarter ended december  competition 
the client server and web based application software markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid change 
the company expects the number of competitors to increase with the company s expansion into additional client server and web based applications 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
the company encounters competition from a number of sources  including i other software companies  ii third party professional services organizations that develop custom software  and iii management information systems departments or outsourcers that develop custom software 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the software market  the company expects additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the client server and web based application software market continues to develop and expand 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
some of the company s current  and many of the company s potential  competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than the company can 
the company also expects that competition could continue to increase as a result of software industry consolidations 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of the company s prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on new products and rapid technological change  risk of product bugs 
the client server and web based application software market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
in  the company invested significant resources into the research and development  sales and marketing of new client server and web based applications 
the company is continuing to invest heavily in these efforts in there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards and customer requirements  or that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products  or that its new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
if the new products currently being developed by the company do not achieve market acceptance or are not released when expected  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the company has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its new products and enhancements after their introduction and has experienced delays or lost revenue during the period required to correct these errors 
although the company has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such errors to date  there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
limited operating history  future operating results uncertain  need to increase sales force 
the company was incorporated in november and began shipping products in december although the company has experienced significant absolute dollar growth in revenue in recent years  there can be no assurance that the prior growth rates are sustainable or indicative of future operating results or that the company will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company s limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including the demand for the company s products  the level of product and price competition  the company s success in expanding its direct sales organization and indirect distribution channels  the ability of the company to develop and market new products and control costs  and the percentage of the company s revenue derived from indirect channels  which may have lower gross margins than direct sales 
in particular  the company intends to hire a significant number of additional sales personnel in and beyond  which is required if the company is to achieve significant revenue growth in the future 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its existing sales personnel or that it can attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified sales persons in the future 
the company increased the size of its sales organization from to in and from to in in the past  the company has experienced difficulty in recruiting a sufficient number of qualified sales persons 
if the company is unable to hire such personnel on a timely basis  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company expects increased competition and intends to invest significantly in its business 
as a result  the company may not sustain current operating margins in the future 
product concentration 
the company currently derives the majority of its revenue from licenses of the ar system  the applications remedy provides  which are built upon the ar system foundation  and related services 
broad market acceptance of the company s products is critical to the company s future success 
as a result  a decline in demand for or failure to achieve broad market acceptance of the ar system foundation and applications as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
the company s future financial performance will depend in part on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the ar system foundation and other applications 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in marketing the ar system or any new or enhanced products or applications 
in  the company invested significant resources into the research and development  sales and marketing of new client server and web based applications 
however  the company believes that its success in expanding its product line will depend largely on new products achieving market acceptance and technological competitiveness 
management of growth  dependence upon key personnel 
the company has recently experienced a period of significant growth that has placed a significant strain upon its management systems and resources 
the company recently implemented a number of new financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage its employee work force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so successfully 
the company s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its key technical  sales and senior management personnel  none of whom is bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s current executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has experienced several changes at the executive officer level in the past year 
in march  michael l 
dionne joined the company as senior vice president worldwide sales 
also in march  richard p 
allocco joined the company as vice president and general manager worldwide customer services 
in july  george de urioste  the company s vice president of finance and operations and chief financial officer  left the company and ron j 
fior joined the company as his replacement 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key technical  sales and managerial employees or that it can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
expansion of indirect channels 
an integral part of the company s strategy is to continue to develop the marketing channels of value added resellers vars  system integrators sis and independent software vendors isvs 
vars  sis and isvs accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue in if these marketing channels increase as a percentage of sales  the company s operating margins may be adversely affected due to the lower unit prices that the company receives when selling through indirect channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract vars  sis and isvs that will be able to market the company s products effectively and will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
in addition  the company s agreements with vars  sis  and isvs are not exclusive and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause  and many of the company s vars  sis and isvs carry competing product lines 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any var  si or isv will continue to represent the company s products  and the inability to recruit  or the loss of important vars  sis or isvs could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in addition  if it is successful in selling products through these channels  the company expects that any material increase in the company s indirect sales as a percentage of total revenue may adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit prices that the company receives when selling through indirect channels 
the company intends to rely on third party implementation providers  including integration consulting firms and remedy approved consultant contractors racs  to assist with the implementation of its products in large enterprise customers and in the training of personnel within such enterprises  in order to meet demand for implementation of the company s product from large enterprise customers  if any 
if the company s strategy to increase its sales to enterprise customers and to use third party service providers to service such customers is successful  the company s operating margins may be lower as a result of the higher expenses associated with engaging third party service providers 
international operations  currency fluctuations 
international sales represented approximately of the company s revenue in the company currently has seven international wholly owned subsidiaries  which are primarily sales offices  which are located in the united kingdom  france  germany  singapore  australia  japan and canada 
one of the company s strategies is to continue to expand its existing international operations and enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
traditionally  international operations are characterized by higher operating expenses and lower operating margins 
as a result  if international revenues increase as a percentage of total revenue  operating margins may be adversely affected 
costs associated with international expansion include the establishment of additional foreign offices  the hiring of additional personnel  the localization and marketing of its products for particular foreign markets and the development of relationships with additional international service providers 
if international revenue is not adequate to offset the expense of expanding foreign operations  the company s business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s international sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in those markets 
in the future  some portion of the company s revenues may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars and  as a result  the company may in the future engage in minimal hedging activities 
if any revenues are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  the company will be subject to the risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  due to the substantial volatility of foreign exchange rates  the company s business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s international operations are subject to other risks inherent in international business activities and generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  products lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and general economic conditions in such countries 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  the company s results of operations 
in addition  because a substantial majority of the company s international sales are indirect  any material increase in the company s international sales as a percentage of total revenue may adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit prices that the company receives when selling through indirect channels 
general economic and market conditions 
during recent years  segments of the personal computer industry have experienced significant economic downturns characterized by decreased product demand  production over capacity  price erosion  work slowdowns and layoffs 
the company s operations may in the future experience substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of such industry patterns  general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers  and other factors affecting capital spending 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology  risks of infringement 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
the company presently has no patents or patent applications pending 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  it is possible that such licenses may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringes the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim infringement by the company with respect to current or future products 
the company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the company s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
product liability 
the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  it is possible that such licenses may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
for these and other reasons  it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the company s license agreements may not be effective 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with potential acquisitions 
from time to time the company may acquire or invest in companies  technologies or products that complement the company s business or its product offerings 
any such acquisitions may result in the use of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the write off of software development costs or other assets  incurrence of severance liabilities  the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and or the incurrence of debt  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
acquisitions involve numerous additional risks including difficulties in the assimilation of operations  services  products and personnel  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the disruption of the company s business  and the entry into markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience 
in addition  potential acquisition candidates targeted by the company may not have audited financial statements  detailed financial information or any degree of internal controls 
there can be no assurance that an audit subsequent to any successful completion of an acquisition will not reveal matters of significance  including with respect to revenues  expenses  liabilities  contingent or otherwise  and intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with selling to large enterprise customers 
the company has recently increased it efforts to sell its products to large enterprise customers  and has devoted significant management and financial resources to achieving this goal 
if successful  large enterprise customers are expected to deploy the company s products in business critical operations which involve significant capital and management commitments by such customers 
potential large enterprise customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available enterprise software and require the company to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them about the value of the company s solutions 
sales of the company s products to such customers require an extensive sales effort throughout a customer s organization because decisions to purchase such products generally involve the evaluation of the software by a significant number of customer personnel in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
a variety of factors  including factors over which the company has little or no control  may cause potential large enterprise customers to favor a particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase 
as a result of these or other factors  the sales cycle for the company s products is long  typically ranging between three and nine months 
as a result of the length of the sales cycle and the significant selling expenses resulting from selling into the large enterprise  the company s ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales is limited  and the delay or failure to complete one or more large transactions to which the company has devoted significant resources could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition and could cause significant variations in the company s operating results from quarter to quarter 
year compliance 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
in  the company incurred approximately million in its year remediation efforts 
roughly half of these costs are attributed to external consulting with the remainder being internal costs and equipment 
remedy expects additional remediation costs of approximately million in  which includes expenditures for consulting  equipment and internal personnel 
it is expected that the entire amount will be expensed in although the company is not currently aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal it systems and non it systems for the year  the company may experience material unanticipated problems caused by undetected errors in both technology utilized for our it systems and vendors with whom remedy does business 
any year compliance problems of either the company or its vendors could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
the company is currently taking steps to address year issues in the following three areas remedy products internal systems including information technology such as financial and order entry systems and non information technology systems such as phones and facilities third parties with whom we have business relationships the company has assigned a dedicated year project team to develop and implement a comprehensive year readiness plan for our world wide operations relating to all of these areas 
this plan has executive sponsorship  is regularly reviewed by senior management and includes progress reports to appropriate parties on a regular basis 
remedy products remedy software currently supports any date value set by the operating system 
all date information  such as creation dates  modification dates  and time date stamps  is generated using the date value provided by the operating system microsoft windows  apple macintosh  unix  and others 
the company believes the functionality of the current or listed versions of the following remedy products will not be impaired by the change to the year the current versions of these products accurately represent date information within the constraints of the operating systems on which they run action request system r version or newer  including localized versions multi processing server option tm distributed server option tm full text search option tm arweb r version or newer flashboards r version or newer remedy help desk tm version or newer remedy help desk express tm remedy service level agreements tm remedy change management tm remedy asset management tm as remedy software supports the date value set by the operating system  it is important for customers to confirm that the operating systems in use are  or will be  year compliant 
the software license agreement provided with the remedy software includes a year certification 
that provision states that the remedy software  when used in conjunction with the remedy compatible operating systems described in the remedy software documentation  will accurately process date data including  but not limited to  calculating  comparing  and sequencing from  into and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries including leap year calculations 
the provision also assumes that all products hardware  software and firmware used in combination with the remedy software will properly exchange date data with the remedy software 
internal systems the company s internal systems include both its information technology it and non it systems 
the company has initiated an assessment of its internal it systems including third party software and hardware technology and its non it systems such as its security system  building equipment  and embedded microcontrollers and retained an outside contractor to provide assistance 
the company expects to complete that testing in q of to the extent the company is unable to test the technology provided by third party vendors  the company is seeking assurances from such vendors that their systems are year compliant 
third parties the company is currently researching the status of its vendors concerning the year compliance status 
if the company s current or future vendors fail to achieve year compliance or if they divert technology expenditures especially technology expenditures that were reserved for enterprise software to address year compliance problems  the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company has not yet fully developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if the company is unable to achieve year readiness of its critical operations 
the cost of developing and implementing such a plan may itself be material 
finally  the company is also subject to external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as utility or transportation companies year compliance failures and related service interruptions
