results of operations 
total revenues for fiscal increased million to million  a increase over the prior year 
our policy of balanced diversification continues to create increased stakeholder value through strong growth in sales and earnings 
a significant portion of the increase relates to our continued penetration within the electronic cable markets and the benefits received from our electronic manufacturing services segment that includes our acquisition of rwa  inc effective may  the specialized manufacturing segment continued to provide some growth although it was effected by the loss of certain sales that were included last year due to a distribution agreement that was terminated as of september  these sales reductions were offset by increases within our existing divisions and at increased margins as the product was manufactured by the company

the dollar value of cost of products was higher in fiscal compared to both and these increases were mostly volume related 
as a percent of sales  cost of products increased to in when compared to in while was about the same as the current year 
the increase is due to some increase in raw material costs  product mix and some selling price erosion created by competitive pressure 
when comparing to  raw materials cost decreases were a significant part of the gross profit margin improvement 
gross profit margins during the past three years have been relatively stable and we would expect continued solid margins during the current fiscal year as long as current market trends prevail

these improved sales and the elimination of a need to adjust certain investments assisted in our profit enhancement 
management will continue its approach of seeking to maximize and expand our current businesses while at the same time seeking future opportunities through selective acquisitions
