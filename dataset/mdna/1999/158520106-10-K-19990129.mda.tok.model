working capital as of october   was million  an increase of million from october  the increase in cash and cash equivalents and working capital consists primarily of the residual net proceeds of the stock offering and the acquisitions 
in april  the company completed an offering of  common shares 
the net proceeds net of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses to the company from the april offering approximated million 
approximately million of the net proceeds has been used to reduce long term debt through october  the remaining proceeds from the april stock offering are invested in a money market account with a national financial institution 
it is management s intention to maintain these funds in a highly liquid money market account to be used for further debt reduction  working capital and general purposes  including the continuation of the company s acquisition program 
management is in the process of implementing a corporate wide cash management program that management anticipates will provide it with better access to daily cash flow 
this program is expected to be in place by the second quarter of fiscal year once the program is implemented  management believes it will be in a position to better utilize available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to further reduce long term debt 
the company has historically used cash generated from operating activities and debt to finance capital expenditures and the cash portion of the purchase price of acquisitions 
management plans to continue making significant investments in equipment and expects total capital expenditures to approximate million in included in these capital expenditures for is the initial cost to convert the company s printing operations to a centralized information system see below for further discussion regarding the company s information systems infrastructure 
however  to fund the company s continued expansion of operations internally and through acquisitions and to upgrade its information systems  additional financing may be necessary 
the company has available lines of credit totaling million see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
for the foreseeable future  management believes it can fund operations  meet debt service requirements  and make the planned capital expenditures based on the available cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and lines of credit 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities for the years ended october   and were million  million  and million 
these cash flows increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased net income  depreciation and amortization  and the improvement in the management of accounts receivable and inventories 
the reduction in deferred revenue in the year ended october   was from an acquired company that had previously required advance payments on certain large transactions 
cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal year compared to decreased primarily as a result of the investment in inventories to support increased sales 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were million  million  and million for the years ended october    and cash flows used in investing activities decreased in compared to as a result of the increase in proceeds from sales of assets and the cash received from acquired businesses 
this decrease was partially offset by the additional investment in property and equipment of million 
cash flows used in investing activities in compared to also decreased because of the change in cash related to make acquired businesses 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities for the years ended october    and were million  million  and million 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in compared to came from the proceeds from the stock offering  net of issuance expenses  partially offset by the repayment of notes payable and long term debt 
the decrease in net cash flows from financing activities in compared to related to the reduction in new long term borrowings and the increase in debt service from the debt assumed in the interform acquisition 
equipment and vehicles have generally been financed through bank financing 
dividends paid in fiscal years  and were million  million and million 
inflation and economic conditions management believes that the effect of inflation on the company s operations has not been material and will continue to be immaterial for the foreseeable future 
the company does not have long term contracts  therefore  to the extent permitted by competition  it has the ability to pass through to its customers most cost increases resulting from inflation  if any 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced a greater portion of its annual sales and net income in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters 
the second quarter generally reflects increased orders for printing of corporate annual reports and proxy statements 
a post labor day increase in demand for printing services and office products coincides with the company s fourth quarter 
information systems and year assessment update management has in place a company wide program to assess the need to modify or replace portions or all of its information systems to maintain its competitiveness and enable the proper processing of transactions relating to the year and beyond 
management has made the decision to purchase and implement a new information system for the printing divisions 
this new system is an enterprise wide system encompassing sales  purchasing  production  and financial reporting 
implementation is expected to begin in march or april and take approximately two years 
there are four printing systems currently in use that are not year compliant 
these systems will be converted first and are expected to be operational by september  in the event that these non compliant systems are not converted by december   the systems can be converted to the company s core printing software  that is year compliant  within a short timeframe of one to two months 
it is anticipated that the new system will cost approximately   related to software and training and  of hardware costs 
approximately  of these estimated costs will be capitalized and amortized against income over a period of five years 
it is the opinion of management that the cost of converting the printing divisions to a new information system and the annual amortization thereof will not materially impact results of operations or financial condition 
there are a number of risks in implementing a new system  including the complexity of the conversion process and the new systems themselves  the converting of business data from the old system to the new system  and the need for comprehensive employee training on the new information systems 
there can be no assurance that this process will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
based on its assessment of the information currently available  management has determined that the office products and office furniture division information system is year compliant 
once the new information system is implemented in all of the printing divisions  a program will be initiated to assess the benefits of having both divisions under one financial reporting system 
in addition  management is in the process of finalizing its assessment of non critical systems 
based on the information currently available  most of these systems are year compliant 
the systems that are not compliant will be replaced 
the new systems are expected to be operational by july  the related costs to replace these systems are not expected to be material to the operating results or financial position of the company 
the company is also in the process of obtaining assurances from its significant suppliers  large customers  financial institutions  and others that those parties are year compliant or have appropriate plans to remediate year issues 
the company has received correspondence from some third parties and it appears they are taking reasonable steps to remedy year issues 
the company continues to assess the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should those organizations fail to properly remediate their computer systems 
while management believes its efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial position
