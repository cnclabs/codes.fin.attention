item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general over the past few years  petco has expanded its store format from smaller  traditional stores to the current superstore format 
at the end of fiscal  superstore square footage represented over of the company s total square footage 
petco plans to open superstores in the future and follows a strategy of converting and expanding its existing store base to conform to the superstore format 
as a result of this strategy  the company has opened and acquired superstores  has expanded and relocated smaller stores into superstores and has closed underperforming stores 
as a result of the company s store expansion strategy  operating results may reflect lower average store contribution and operating margins due to increased store preopening expenses and lower anticipated sales volumes of immature stores 
during fiscal the company completed two acquisitions of retailers of pet food and supplies which were accounted for as purchases 
the company also acquired three retailers of pet food and supplies which operated under the trade names pet nosh  with eight stores in the new york area  pets usa with four stores in colorado  and pet food warehouse with stores in the upper midwestern states 
these acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interests

the company also acquired a retailer that operated pet food and supply stores under the trade name petcare located in midwestern and southern states which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
during fiscal the company completed two acquisitions of retailers of pet food and supplies operating four stores in transactions accounted for as purchases 
all results of operations have been restated to reflect the poolings of interests and to reflect the purchase transactions from their respective acquisition dates 
results of operations from immaterial poolings are reflected from the beginning of the period from which these acquisitions were consummated

the company s compliance program includes various initiatives  including conducting an inventory and identification of all year sensitive components of the company s it and non it systems including hardware  software  security  and telecommunications  requesting compliance status statements from the company s business partners  suppliers and vendors  and testing of new and existing systems 
the inventory and identification of year it and non it issues is now largely complete 
many year it issues have been resolved through hardware and software updates and upgrades undertaken for other reasons 
as part of the company s ongoing it upgrade plans  in fiscal the company completed the conversion of its store point of sale systems to a year compliant version at a cost of approximately million  which has been capitalized and will be depreciated over the components estimated useful lives 
this conversion  although not undertaken specifically for year purposes  was accelerated in order to achieve year compliance in this critical area 
with respect to non it systems  the company has nearly completed the inventory and assessment of its embedded systems contained in the corporate offices  distribution centers and store locations 
this assessment is focusing principally on the company s telecommunications system hardware and software and security systems 
the amount of other expenditures for updates and upgrades that relate specifically to year compliance is not separable from the total  but is not believed to be a material amount 
the remaining year compliance activities are expected to be substantially completed by mid for certain of the company s key suppliers  such as pet food suppliers  the disruption of product deliveries would have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company is actively extending its relationships with these suppliers to include joint year risk assessments  remedial actions  and contingency plans in the event of non compliance 
contingency plans  which are expected to be substantially completed by mid  may include backup manual ordering procedures and inventory buildup by the company prior to december  any additional inventory buildup by the company would generate unfavorable cash flows and inventory valuation exposures of uncertain amount and duration 
the company does not expect the cost of its year compliance program to be material to its business  results of operations  or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s assessment of the impact of year is complete and that further analysis and study  as well as the testing and implementation of planned solutions  will not reveal the need for additional remedial work 
the company is potentially vulnerable to mistakes made by key suppliers of products and services in their advice to the company with respect to their year readiness 
the company is also potentially vulnerable to operational difficulties in the company s corporate offices  distribution centers or store locations  including the risk of power and water outages and the potential failure of credit card and check authorization systems 
the financial magnitude of these risks cannot currently be estimated 
the foregoing statements as to the company s year efforts are forward looking and  along with all other forward looking statements herein  are made in reliance on the safe harbor provisions discussed under the caption certain cautionary statements in item  above 
new accounting standards in june the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the statement 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations and expansion program through internal cash flow  external borrowings and the sale of equity securities 
at january   total assets were million  million of which were current assets 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s sales are substantially on a cash basis 
therefore  cash flow generated from operating stores provides a significant source of liquidity to the company 
the principal use of operating cash is for the purchase of merchandise inventories 
a portion of the company s inventory purchases is financed through vendor credit terms 
the company uses cash in investing activities primarily to acquire stores  purchase fixed assets for new and converted stores and  to a lesser extent  to purchase warehouse and office fixtures  equipment and computer hardware and software in support of its distribution and administrative functions 
during fiscal the company invested million in a limited partnership that operates retail pet food and supply stores in canada and made loans of million to a limited partner in the limited partnership 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company also finances some of its purchases of equipment and fixtures through capital lease and other obligations 
purchases of million  million and million of fixed assets were financed in this manner during fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes additional sources of capital lease and other obligation financing are available on a cost effective basis and plans to use them  as necessary  in connection with its expansion program 
during fiscal  the company completed two acquisitions of retailers of pet food and supplies in purchase transactions 
the aggregate fair value of assets acquired was million and assumed liabilities were million with million of net cash invested in the acquisition of these businesses  of which million was expended in fiscal during fiscal  the company completed two acquisitions of retailers of pet food and supplies in purchase transactions 
the aggregate fair value of assets acquired and the net cash invested in the acquisition of these businesses was million 
the company s primary long term capital requirement is funding for the opening or acquisition of superstores and conversion of existing stores into superstores 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal   and  net proceeds of million  million  and million  respectively  were generated from sales of common stock 
remaining cash flows provided by financing activities were borrowings under long term debt agreements  net of repayment of long term debt agreements and other obligations 
cash flows from financing activities were used to finance the acquisition of related businesses and fund the company s expansion program and working capital requirements 
the company has a credit facility with a syndicate of banks with a commitment of up to million that expires january  the credit facility provides for million in revolving loans and a million term loan 
borrowings under the credit facility are unsecured and bear interest  at the company s option  at the agent bank s corporate base rate or libor plus to  based on the company s leverage ratio at the time 
the credit agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants related to indebtedness  interest and fixed charges coverage  and consolidated net worth 
as of january   the company had million of revolving loans available under the credit facility 
as of january   the company had available net operating loss carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes  which begin expiring in  and million for state income tax purposes  which begin expiring in the company anticipates that funds generated by operations  funds available under the credit facility and currently available vendor financing and capital lease and other obligation financing will be sufficient to finance its continued operations and planned store openings at least through fiscal inflation although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  it does not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on its net sales or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in short term interest rates as the company s unsecured credit facility utilizes a portfolio of short term libor contracts 
libor contracts are fixed rate instruments for a period of between one and six months  at the company s discretion 
the company s portfolio of libor contracts vary in length and interest rate  such that adverse changes in short term interest rates could affect the company s overall borrowing rate when contracts are renewed 
the lengths of contracts within the portfolio are adjusted to balance the company s working capital requirements  fixed asset purchases and general corporate purposes 
the company continuously evaluates the portfolio with respect to total debt  including an assessment of the current and future economic environment 
as of january   the company had million in debt under the credit facility 
the average debt outstanding for the fiscal year was million 
based on this average debt level  a hypothetical adverse change in libor rates would increase net interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis  and likewise would decrease our earnings and cash flows 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on debt  nor can there be any assurance that long term fixed rate debt will be available at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes in interest rates or debt availability 
the company did not have any material foreign exchange or other significant market risk or any derivative financial instruments at january
