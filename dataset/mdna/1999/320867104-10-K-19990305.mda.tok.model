item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is intended to address the significant factors affecting first midwest s consolidated income statements for the years through and statements of condition as of december  and the discussion is designed to provide stockholders with a more comprehensive review of the operating results and financial condition than could be obtained from a review of the consolidated financial statements alone and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto and other financial information presented in this form k 
a condensed review of operations for the fourth quarter of is included on page the review provides an analysis of the quarterly earnings performance for the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in the consolidated financial statements and financial information for all previously reported periods presented herein have been restated to include first midwest s july  acquisition of heritage which was accounted for as a pooling of interests and is discussed in the acquisitions section that follows 
all dollar amounts are presented in thousands  except per share date 
unless otherwise stated  all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis 
acquisitions heritage financial services  inc on july   first midwest consummated the merger with heritage in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
heritage  headquartered in suburban chicago  was a multi bank holding company whose subsidiaries included a branch commercial bank  a trust company and a subsidiary that offered trust services and operated an insurance agency business 
heritage had total assets and stockholders equity of approximately billion and million  respectively  as of july  each outstanding share of heritage common stock  no par value  was converted into 
shares of first midwest common stock  
par value  resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of first midwest common stock 
first midwest merged heritage s commercial bank and trust company  into first midwest bank  national association and first midwest trust company  respectively  in the fourth quarter the remaining subsidiary  heritage bank  national association  continues to offer trust services to customers of first midwest  the insurance agency business formerly operated by this subsidiary was transferred to first midwest bank  national association in connection with the commercial bank merger 
in connection with the merger  first midwest recognized  in the third quarter of  a pretax merger related charge totalling  consisting of  in customary acquisition related costs and expenses and in provision for loan losses incident to conforming the commercial bank s credit policies to first midwest s 
further information regarding the transaction is included under item of this form k located on page and in note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page sparbank  incorporated on october   first midwest consummated the merger with sparbank  incorporated sparbank  the holding company of mchenry state bank msb a million commercial bank  located in mchenry  illinois 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests with an exchange of common stock resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of first midwest common stock to sparbank shareholders 
in connection with the merger  first midwest recorded a merger related charge in the amount  or 
per share relating to the acquisition consisting of  in acquisition related costs and expenses and in provision for loan losses incident to conforming msb s credit policies to first midwest s 
on february   msb was merged into first midwest bank  national association

in management of net interest margin net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest expense paid for the funding sources used to finance those assets 
changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and the rates earned and paid  respectively  on those assets and liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
for purposes of this discussion  both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis for certain tax exempt loans and securities

interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis 
net interest margin in decreased to from in and in the decrease in net interest margin in is primarily due to four factors i a lower level of high yielding loans  ii a reduction in the overall yield of the securities available for sale portfolio relating primarily to collateralized mortgage obligations  iii a higher level of public funds at lower interest spreads  and  iv the purchase of corporate owned life insurance 
as noted on table  the most significant factor effecting the reduction in net interest income from to was a decrease in interest income on the loan portfolio attributable to both lower volumes and  to a lesser extent  lower rates earned on the portfolio 
the year to year reduction in loan volumes is due to two factors  securitized loans transferred to the securities available for sale portfolio and the planned outplacement of certain higher risk loans 
during  first midwest securitized approximately million in family residential real estate loans and transferred them to the securities available for sale portfolio as a result of the integration of both the heritage and sparbank loan portfolios 
additionally  during first midwest undertook the planned outplacement of approximately million in higher risk loans from both the first midwest and heritage loan portfolios in an effort to improve the risk profile of the consolidated portfolio 
first midwest s collateralized mortgage obligation cmo portfolio of mortgage backed securities is carried in the securities available for sale category 
as noted in table  the yield on securities available for sale decreased to in from in and in the reduction in the overall rate earned was due primarily to the cmo portfolio and resulted from the overall low interest rate environment and its impact on mortgage refinancings generally 
as a result of the trend in refinancings  mortgage loan prepayments and the resulting prepayments on the cmo portfolio increased significantly in and  the overall investment yield was negatively impacted 
to minimize earnings volatility  first midwest restructured its securities available for sale portfolio during  selling a portion of its cmo portfolio and reinvesting the proceeds in a combination of us government and tax exempt securities 
also contributing to the reduction in net interest margin during was an increase in public funds deposited by local governments accompanied by a reduction in the net interest spread earned on such funds of approximately basis points  primarily during the second half of the increase in volumes was due primarily to a seasonal  higher level of tax receipts and operating funds deposited by this core customer base while the decrease in interest spread was primarily due to the volatility in the interest rate markets during the third quarter of finally  first midwest purchased approximately million in corporate owned life insurance during  while no such investment existed in while the life insurance asset is reflected on the statement of condition as a non earning asset with the related income being reflected in noninterest income  the cost of funding the assets flows through net interest income in the form of interest expense 
the earnings on corporate owned life insurance produces an after tax earnings rate of approximately 
the impact of this investment on net interest margin in was a reduction of approximately basis points 
while first midwest is able to partially insulate itself against volatility in the interest rate markets through asset liability management techniques and the establishment of funding liquidity policies  improvement in net interest margin and income in future quarters will be dependent on its ability to generate higher yielding assets  primarily in the form of loan growth 
the following sections entitled rate sensitivity management and funding and liquidity management describe the techniques used by first midwest in managing the volatility and other factors affecting net interest income and net interest margin 
rate sensitivity management first midwest s earning assets and funding sources do not respond uniformly to changing market interest rates because of the differing interest rate  repricing and maturity characteristics of the various balance sheet categories of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk is the degree to which these market interest rate fluctuations can affect net interest income 
while there are several ways in which to analyze interest rate risk  the traditional method is called gap analysis 
gap analysis is a static management tool used to identify mismatches or gaps in the repricing of assets and liabilities within specified periods of time 
first midwest s gap analysis as of december  is presented in table earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented within selected time intervals over a one year forward period based upon their repricing and maturity characteristics 
in a perfectly matched gap analysis  an equal amount of rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be reflected as repricing within each given time interval 
a positive interest rate sensitivity gap indicates more assets than liabilities will reprice in that time period  while a negative gap indicates more liabilities will reprice 
table analysis of rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  days days days days rate sensitive assets rsa     rate sensitive liabilities rsl     interest sensitivity gap gap rsa less rsl incremental     cumulative     cumulative  excluding savings and now accounts 
    rsa rsl ratio gap total assets cumulative gap total assets cumulative  excluding savings and now accounts the preceding table reflects a cumulative liability sensitive balance sheet over a one year time frame which likely will more positively affect net interest income if interest rates fall than if they rise 
however  while the gap analysis is widely used in the industry  it is unable to capture other factors affecting the sensitivity of the balance sheet  such as the time lags required for certain assets and liabilities to reprice because of their varying sensitivity to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  included in the total for rate sensitive liabilities are  in savings and now accounts 
while immediately repriceable  the rates paid on these deposit accounts will not change in direct correlation with changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
for example  if first midwest s base lending rate declines by basis points  the interest rate paid on these deposits will not immediately decline by the full basis points 
conversely  if lending rates increase by the same amount  the rates paid on these deposits will likewise not increase immediately or by the full basis points 
for the reasons noted above  a static gap analysis has limitations in its usefulness and its ability to effectively present the rate sensitivity of a balance sheet 
accordingly  first midwest uses a more dynamic approach to measuring interest rate risk by conducting simulations that demonstrate the changes that would occur in net interest income under different interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this form of modeling is conducted monthly  involves adjustments to balance sheet volumes over a month forward period  incorporates a repricing analysis of earning assets and funding sources and considers certain other off balance sheet hedging vehicles such as interest rate exchange agreements swaps  as further described below 
furthermore  first midwest has generally followed a policy of maintaining a balanced mix of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  making each side of the balance sheet approximately equally flexible in reacting to changes in market interest rates so that net interest income will not be adversely affected by more than  regardless of whether interest rates rise or fall rapidly 
the simulations described above  coupled with policy guidelines intended to limit the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates  provide guidance to first midwest in adjusting its strategies based on projections of the future interest rate environment to ensure maximization of net interest income 
the net interest income simulation model used by first midwest to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates utilizes interest rate scenarios that show interest rates gradually rising by basis points  falling by basis points and remaining flat over a month horizon 
additionally the model has the capability of determining the affect on net interest income of an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  cash flows and maturities of derivative and other financial instruments  changes in loan volumes and pricing  deposit sensitivity and first midwest s capital plans 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in interest rate market conditions and strategies  among other factors 
furthermore  first midwest also believes that immediate and sustained changes in interest rates will not necessarily impact all interest bearing liabilities in the same fashion 
as discussed above  an immediate increase or decrease in first midwest s base lending rate may not result in an immediate  identical increase in rates paid on non maturing  non indexed interest bearing liabilities such as savings accounts and now accounts 
accordingly  first midwest analyzes the impact of immediate and sustained parallel changes in interest rates both including and excluding non maturing  non indexed deposits 
based on the results of its simulation model and the assumptions included therein  as of december   exclusive of the effect of the rate increase on non maturing  non indexed deposits  first midwest would expect a decrease in net interest income of and an increase in net interest income of if interest rates experienced an immediate increase or decrease  respectively  by basis points over a month period 
if non maturing  non indexed deposits were included in this analysis and were immediately affected by such increase or decrease in interest rates  the reduction in net interest income from a rise in rates of basis points would be while an improvement in net interest income of would result from a reduction in interest rates of basis points 
comparative data for is not presented due to the heritage acquisition and the resulting pooling of interests restatement 
first midwest believes that its interest rate sensitivity position is appropriate given the current economic and interest rate environment 
as a part of its approach to controlling the interest rate risk within its balance sheet  first midwest has entered into interest rate swaps with third parties in order to limit variations in net interest income 
the advantages of using interest rate swaps include the ability to maintain or increase liquidity  lower capital requirements as compared to cash instruments  enhance net interest margin and to customize the interest rate swap agreement to meet desired risk parameters 
interest rate swap transactions involve exchanges of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional ie  principal amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
the net cash flow paid or received by first midwest on these transactions is treated as an adjustment to the interest income and expense on the underlying earning asset or funding source to which the swap relates 
these swaps earn interest at libor and pay interest at the prime rate as quoted in the wall street journal less basis points 
the weighted average rate being received by first midwest at year end was while paying on the  notional amount of the basis swaps 
the primary risk associated with interest rate swap transactions is credit risk  or the ability of the swap counterparty to perform its interest payment obligation under the terms of the agreement 
credit risk on the interest rate swap transactions consists of the aggregate net interest payable to first midwest by the counterparty in addition to the aggregate unrealized gain on the swap position 
first midwest controls this credit risk by maintaining a policy limiting credit exposure to any one counterparty to not more than of consolidated stockholders equity 
in addition  first midwest s interest rate swap transactions generally require the establishment of a mutual mark to market arrangement whereby cash collateral may be required to be on deposit with first midwest and or the counterparty 
as of december   first midwest had total interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of  in place  hedging various balance sheet categories 
the specific terms of these swaps as well as the fair value are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page first midwest does not act as an intermediary in arranging interest rate swaps for customers 
funding and liquidity management liquidity management is the ability to provide funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit  withdrawal and loan demand needs 
first midwest s liquidity policy establishes parameters as to how liquidity should be managed to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in liquidity needs over a month forward period  including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the board of directors 
while asset liquidity provides funds through the maturity and sale of loans  securities  and other interest earning assets  another source of liquidity is liability liquidity  consisting primarily of interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposits as well as repurchase agreements 
other liability funding sources potentially include funds purchased facilities available through certain correspondent banks and funding through the discount window borrowing facilities of the federal reserve system 
table provides a year to year comparison of the sources of first midwest s liability funding based upon average balances over the last three years 
average  rather than period end  balances are more meaningful in analyzing first midwest s funding sources because of the inherent fluctuations that occur on a monthly basis within most deposit categories 
table funding sources average balances of of of total total total demand deposits    savings deposits    now accounts    money market accounts    time deposits in denominations of or less 
   core deposits    time deposits in denominations of or more 
   repurchase agreements    funds purchased and other short term borrowings    total funding sources    the increase in average core deposits experienced in results from a combination of product introductions coupled with a new advertising campaign and the use of multi media advertising  primarily in the chicago suburban markets 
the front end costs applicable to the advertising promotions are reflected in the increase in advertising and promotion costs shown on table and the discussion following that table 
the increase in time deposits of or more resulted from higher levels of governmental deposits as discussed in the net interest income section located on page tables and that follow provide additional information regarding first midwest s wholesale deposit and short term funding activities table maturities of time deposits of or more as of december  maturing within months  after but within months  after but within months  after months  total  table short term borrowing activities as of december  repurchase agreements    funds purchased   other short term borrowings    total    includes federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
maximum amount outstanding at weighted average interest rate any month end december  repurchase agreements    funds purchased    other short term borrowings 
   years ended december  aggregate short term borrowings average amount outstanding 
   weighted average interest rate paid for each year historically  first midwest has made extensive use of repurchase agreements as a deposit surrogate because this funding source is not subject to the reserve requirements applicable to interest bearing deposits and has also realized direct cost savings in prior years because fdic insurance premiums were not assessed on these funding sources 
during  first midwest reduced its reliance on repurchase agreements as a funding source because the cost of these funds became more expensive relative to both core deposit funding and other short term borrowing sources 
as a result  first midwest placed a greater reliance on funds purchased and fhlb advances 
as interest rates dropped in  first midwest once again emphasized the use of repurchase agreements as a funding source 
the liquidity needs of first midwest parent company consist primarily of operating expenses and dividend payments to first midwest s stockholders 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from affiliates 
however  this source can also be supplemented by fees assessed to affiliates  a practice which has not been utilized in recent years 
the parent company has short term credit facilities available to fund cash flow needs totaling  at december  the parent company also has the ability to enhance its liquidity position by raising capital or incurring debt 
the parent company had  of debt outstanding under its short term credit facilities as of year end analysis of net overhead noninterest income noninterest income  exclusive of net security gains  increased by and in and  respectively  reflecting improvements in virtually all categories  as further discussed below

service charges on deposit accounts  the largest component of noninterest income  consists of fees on both interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts as well as charges for items such as insufficient funds  overdrafts and stop payment requests 
service charges on deposit accounts include both hard dollar charges and charges assessed through account analysis  the latter being reduced by earnings credits indexed to a short term us treasury yield and generally applicable to business deposit accounts 
the increases of  or in and  or in were both due to higher volumes of business checking accounts and the resulting higher service charges 
the trust company provides trust and investment management services to its customers  acting as executor  administrator  trustee  agent  and in various other fiduciary capacities for client accounts 
trust and investment management fees generally follow the amount of total assets under management as well as conditions in the equity and credit markets because fees are often assessed on the market value of managed funds 
assets under management totaled billion at december  representing an increase from the billion at year end and billion at year end changes in trust assets under management from year to year results from a combination of growth in new business  offset by attrition  in addition to equity and bond market conditions impacting the valuation of the trust assets 
this category of noninterest income increased by in  and in the increase in was broad based and effected all types of trust accounts with the largest portion of the increase being realized in the personal trust category 
the increase in was not as broad based and concentrated in employee benefit trusts 
the increase in other service charges  commissions and fees  which totaled in and in  primarily relates to revenue generated by debit card income  merchant credit card fees and alternative investment revenues 
in first midwest purchased certain life insurance policies with five national insurance carriers all of whom were rated in the top ranking levels by the insurance carrier rating agencies 
the policies  on which first midwest is the beneficiary  insure the lives of certain key first midwest executives and were purchased with the proceeds of securities sales from the available for sale portfolio 
corporate owned life insurance income represents the cash buildup from the life insurance policies 
the cash buildup is afforded tax favored treatment and serves as a proxy for tax exempt income 
the tax equivalent yield on the corporate owned life insurance policies  which totaled  at december   was approximately 
other income increased by in over  following a increase in over the increase in both years was attributable to both higher volumes of automatic teller machine atm activity as well as a general increase in fee schedules for atm s 
first midwest conducts its residential real estate mortgage loan origination  sales and servicing operations through fmmc 
mortgage banking revenues from these operations are a major component of noninterest income and include commissions and fees from third party loan servicing  realized gains on the sale of loans into the secondary market and origination and other fees received at closing

million in although servicing fee income increased by or in as compared to  due in large part to the volumes of loans sold to third parties in  the related amortization of mortgage servicing rights also increased by  or due to market interest rates and their affect on refinancing of mortgages 
as mortgages are refinanced  the mortgage servicing rights related to such mortgages likewise must be written down in full 
it is first midwest s policy to use financial derivatives to hedge interest rate risk associated with mortgage servicing rights to minimize the impairment of such servicing rights resulting from a drop in interest rates and the attendant increase in mortgage refinancings

noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled  in as compared to  in and  in noninterest expense in each of the three years included certain special items relating to fdic assessments and acquisition expenses

   compensation expense for must be analyzed within the context of two material factors that occurred in late and throughout  the acquisitions previously described and a restructuring of first midwest s retirement plans 
on october  the sparbank acquisition was consummated and in february its bank subsidiary was merged into first midwest bank  national association 
on july   the heritage acquisition was closed and on october  its bank subsidiary was likewise merged 
furthermore  heritage s trust subsidiary was merged into first midwest trust company on december  the result of these mergers was staff reductions at both bank and trust facilities with an offsetting increase in temporary personnel expense to accommodate the significant level of merger activity 
since most of the merger activity occurred in late  first midwest expects the benefits of this merger activity and the related staff reductions to be more fully realized in another factor affecting salaries and wages in was the restructuring of first midwest s retirement benefits effective january  as a result of the restructuring  first midwest increased base salaries of certain positions to make them more market competitive and reduced retirement benefits which were found to be in excess market levels 
the result contributed to the increase in salary and wages in and the reduction in retirement and other employee benefit costs 
a discussion of first midwest s retirement benefits and the expenses related thereto is included in note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page occupancy expense increased by in over following a increase in over the increase reflects the operational costs of four additional branches established in last half of  with two additional branches opened in the third quarter of and rental increases on certain leased facilities 
the increase reflects the full year operational costs of the branches established in as well as four additional branches in and the expansion of an operations center to accommodate the sparbank and heritage acquisitions 
offsetting a portion of the occupancy cost increases in were savings realized from the merger activity 
equipment expense decreased by in  as compared to  following a increase in over the increase in reflects higher equipment depreciation expense as a result of companywide computer hardware upgrades and capitalized purchases of furniture and equipment for the additional branches established in and the decrease in resulted from an absence of the high volume computer hardware upgrades as well as cost savings associated with the merger activities 
computer processing expense increased by in over and followed a increase in over the increases in both and were primarily volume driven but also included costs related to the merger activities 
additionally  the increase was due to the implementation of a wide area network on a companywide basis 
the increase in professional fees in related primarily to legal costs associated to the loan securitizations as well as costs incurred to establish the hedging activities discussed under the noninterest income section related to mortgage banking activities 
the increase in related to the legal costs associated with the sale of certain residential mortgage loans during that year 
advertising and promotions expense increased in both and over prior years primarily as a result of a new multi media advertising campaign targeting primarily at the suburban metropolitan chicago 
additionally  in both and  additional advertising costs were incurred related to the sparbank and heritage acquisitions to ensure maximum customer retention 
acquisition expenses related to both the sparbank and heritage acquisitions were recorded in and  respectively  and included customary investment banking and professional fees and anticipated severance and related benefits due to staff reductions 
a discussion of the acquisitions  including the special charges incurred  is included under the acquisitions section of managements discussion and analysis located on page and in note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page income taxes first midwest annually develops an income tax plan for the current year and updates its long term plan which addresses a three year tax planning horizon 
first midwest s goal in tax planning is the maximization of long term  after tax profitability on a consolidated basis and not necessarily a reduction in the absolute income tax expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
first midwest s provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense 
an analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods through are detailed in table table analysis of income tax expense income before income tax expense    income tax expense    effective income tax rate certain acquisition related expenses recorded during and were not deductible for income tax purposes and affected the effective tax rates for both years 
factoring out the acquisition related charges for and  the effective tax in each period would have been and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for both and as compared to the prior years is due primarily to planned increases in state tax exempt income 
capital management and dividends a strong capital structure is crucial in maintaining investor confidence  accessing capital markets and enabling first midwest to take advantage of future profitable growth opportunities 
first midwest has developed a policy to manage its capital structure and that of its affiliates in accordance with regulatory guidelines and to ensure the appropriate use of this resource 
first midwest s capital policy requires that each affiliate maintain a capital ratio in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines and also acts as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities  in addition to setting targeted levels of return on equity 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  first midwest and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines require that first midwest and its banking subsidiaries meet specific guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgements by the regulators about components of capital and assets  risk weightings and other factors 
quantative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require first midwest and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital to average assets as defined 
first midwest believes that  as of december   first midwest and first midwest bank  national association meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject

the maturity distributions of mortgaged backed securities in table are based upon the contractual maturities of such securities 
actual maturities of the securities in table may differ from that reflected in the table due to securities with call features which are assumed to be held to contractual maturity for maturity distribution purposes 
in first midwest restructured its mortgaged backed securities portfolio through the purchase of a mixture of short term average life  high coupon collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s and long term tax exempt securities 
first midwest felt that the combination of the cmo s and long term tax exempt securities would provide interest rate risk protection if interest rates rose due to the high coupons on the cmo s and would also provide protection if rates declined due to the lack of callability of the long term tax exempt securities 
during  the cmo portfolio underperformed initial expectations as a result of the decline in market interest rates and the historically high mortgage prepayments that occurred as mortgage holders refinanced their debt 
the increase in prepayments reduced the expected income from the cmo portfolio because the unamortized portion on the cmo balances being paid down was amortized immediately as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
in order to limit the future  potential negative impact on interest income as a result of the performance of the cmo portfolio  first midwest sold the poorest performing portion of that portfolio and offset the effect of the loss by selling a portion of the long term tax exempt securities portfolio at a like gain 
the proceeds from the sale of the securities were reinvested in similar municipal securities  us agency securities and more stable  longer term cash flow mortgage backed securities 
the increase in the mortgage backed securities portfolio from december  to was due in part to this reinvestment  but was primarily attributable to the million in loan securitizations described in the net interest margin section located on page note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page includes an analysis of the securities portfolio including the proceeds and gains losses from the sales

securities gains  net net gains increased in to  as compared to  in and in loan portfolio and credit quality portfolio composition loans represent the principal source of revenue to first midwest because  as a category  they are both the largest component and the highest yielding asset on the statement of condition 
the corollary to generating higher yields  however  is the assumption of credit risk associated with the loan portfolio 
among the ways in which credit risk is controlled is through diversification of the loan portfolio and the limitation of the amount of loans extended to any one industry or group of borrowers 
over the past several years  first midwest has migrated toward a loan portfolio that it has attempted to distribute approximately evenly among the categories of commercial and industrial including agricultural  consumer including real estate family and real estate both commercial and construction 
this type of diversification spreads the risk and reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries 
it is first midwest s policy to concentrate its lending activities in the geographic market areas it serves  generally lending to consumers and small to mid sized businesses from whom deposits are gathered in the same market areas 
as a result  first midwest had no consequential out of market loans at december  first midwest does not engage in lending to foreign countries or foreign entities 
the following table summarizes the total loans outstanding  and their percent of the loan portfolio  for the periods through table loan portfolio as of december  of of of of of total total total total total commercial and industrial      agricultural      consumer      real estate family      real estate commercial      real estate construction      other      total      total loans decreased by in after experiencing four years of growth from through the decrease in total loans was primarily attributable to four factors  i the securitization of million family fixed rate mortgages acquired as a part of the sparbank and heritage loan portfolios  ii lower levels of nonmortgage loan originations as a result of more stringent underwriting and administration standards adopted during  iii the outplacement from various loan categories of approximately million in loans that no longer met heightened credit standards  and iv pricing and underwriting competitive circumstances that became more acute in all of these factors contributed to the decline of the loan portfolio  but the loan securitization factor was by far the most significant  representing of the total million decline in total loans outstanding 
commercial and industrial loans are diversified from an industry standpoint and include loans extended to manufacturing  retailing and other service businesses 
consistent with first midwest s emphasis upon relationship banking  most of these credits represent core  multi relationship customers who also maintain deposit relationships and utilize other first midwest banking services such as cash management 
consumer loans consist of loans made directly to individuals for various personal purposes as well as indirect installment loans represented mainly by automobile financings acquired from dealerships in first midwest s primary markets 
this category also includes direct home equity loans and other direct installment loans 
the decrease in this loan category in from is reflective of the tightened underwriting standards implemented during real estate family loans decreased by  or  in primarily due to the first quarter million loan securitization and the fourth quarter million securitization  as well as accelerated paydowns that were experienced as a result of increased refinancings related to the general decline in mortgage loan interest rates during of real estate family loans are comprised predominantly of owner occupied residential properties 
in addition to the real estate family loans generated for its own portfolio  first midwest also conducts a substantial residential real estate mortgage loan origination  sales and servicing operation through its mortgage banking subsidiary 
in first midwest originated in its primary markets approximately  in real estate family loans 
sales of such loans to the public and private investors totaled approximately  representing of such loans originated in this compares to s  in real estate family loans originated and  in sales into the secondary market 
first midwest s strategy has been to originate and retain in its portfolio adjustable rate mortgages while selling fixed rate mortgages to third party investors  retaining the servicing rights thereon 
this line of business  along with the attendant servicing operations  is further described in the noninterest income section beginning on page real estate commercial loans  totaling  represent multi unit residential mortgages and commercial real estate mortgages  many housing the operations of the borrower s business 
the decrease in commercial real estate loans from to of  was due primarily to heightened competition during the course of from secondary markets 
during the first three quarters of  many first midwest commercial real estate borrowers were being attracted by long term low rate loans being offered through the secondary markets 
first midwest felt that loans on such terms were not appropriate for its portfolio and elected not to compete on those terms 
with the volatility that the bond and credit markets experienced during the early fourth quarter of this trend began to reverse and first midwest expects this reversal to continue into real estate construction loans  which increased by or  in  consist primarily of single family and multi family residential projects located in the primary market areas of first midwest s banking offices 
real estate construction loans are a profitable line of lending for first midwest due to the higher level of interest rates and fees earned on such loans as compared to other loan categories and the favorable loss experience on these loans 
first midwest closely monitors its extension of credit to customers in this loan category in order to limit its exposure to construction projects

first midwest has implemented a comprehensive and standardized credit administration policy and procedures which are monitored by an internal loan review staff 
these policies and procedures are reviewed and modified on an ongoing basis in order to remain suitable for the management of risk as conditions change and new financial products having credit risk are offered 
first midwest s credit administration policies include a loan rating system and an analysis by the internal loan review staff of all loans and commitments over a fixed limit  as well as statistical sampling of loans under such dollar limit 
furthermore  each account officer is vested with the responsibility of monitoring their respective loan customer relationships and acts as the first line of defense in determining changes in the loan ratings on credits for which they are responsible 
first midwest believes that any significant change in the overall quality of the loan portfolio will first manifest itself in the migration of loan ratings within the monitoring system 
first midwest maintains a reserve for loan losses to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the reserve for loan losses is determined by systematically performing a review of the loan portfolio quality as required by the credit administration policies and procedures described above 
the reserve for loan losses consists of three elements  i reserves established for specific loans developed through detailed credit reviews  ii reserves based on historical loan loss experience  and  iii reserves based on general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors in the markets in which first midwest operates 
the specific reserves are based on the detailed analysis of loans over a specified dollar limit  as discussed above  as well as loans where the internal credit rating is below a predetermined classification 
specific reserves for commercial loans are based on an ongoing review of individual loans outstanding and binding commitments to lend  whereas consumer and retail loan reserve allocations are based upon the evaluation of pools or groups of such loans 
the portion of the reserve based on historical loan loss experience is determined statistically using a loss migration analysis that examines loss experience and the related internal rating of loans charged off 
the loss migration analysis is performed quarterly and loss factors are periodically updated based on actual experience 
the portion of the reserve based on general economic conditions and other factors is considered the unallocated portion of the reserve 
this portion considers general economic conditions and involves a higher degree of subjectivity in its determination 
this segment of the reserve considers risk factors that may not have not manifested themselves in first midwest s historical loss experience used to determine the allocated component of the reserve 
table shows the allocation of the reserve for loan losses by loan category as well as charge off and recovery information for the last years 
in  first midwest refined its allocation methodology to more closely align the projected losses in each category of the loan portfolio with the migration analysis and historical loan loss experience methodology discussed above 
additionally  based upon the year planning discussed in the section entitled impact of the year located on page  first midwest has also incorporated an allocation of the reserve for loan losses totalling  to loan categories that contain loans to customers categorized as high risk with respect to their year compliance 
accordingly  first midwest has allocated a larger portion of its reserve for loan losses in than in prior years 
the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense in any given year is dependent on factors including loan growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  net charge off levels and management s assessment of the reserve for loan losses based upon the credit administration policies and procedures discussed above 
the provision for loan losses totalled  and includes representing a one time provision to conform heritage s credit policies to first midwest s 
the provision for loan losses of  includes  representing a one time provision to likewise conform sparbank s credit policies 
the reduction in the provision for loan losses in is directly attributable to the decrease in loan volumes discussed under the portfolio composition section located on page based upon the reduction in loans outstanding in and the risk profile of the portfolio generally  first midwest determined that the provision could be appropriately reduced

past due loans are loans which are delinquent days or more and are still accruing interest 
it is first midwest s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan when there is reasonable doubt as to the timely collectability of interest or principal 
nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the financial position of the borrower and other relevant factors indicate there is no longer doubt as to such collectability

first midwest s disclosure with respect to impaired loans is contained in note to notes to the consolidated financial statements located on page in addition to the loans summarized in table  the securities and exchange commission industry guide for bank holding companies requires that certain other loans in the portfolio which first midwest is monitoring  but where existing conditions do not warrant classification as nonaccrual or restructured  be disclosed 
these loans  which totaled  at december   as compared to  at year end  continue to accrue interest and are specifically considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
year readiness disclosure notice is hereby given that the year statement set forth below is being designated a year readiness disclosure in accordance with section b of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
introduction since april  first midwest has been engaged in the process of addressing a potential problem that is facing all users of automated information systems  including personal computers  that is generally referred to as the year issue 
the issue is the result of computer systems processing transactions based upon digits representing the year of the transaction rather than full digits ie for 
these computer systems may not operate properly when the last two digits become  as will occur on january  in some cases  this could result in a system failure  miscalculations causing disruptions of operations or the temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the issue could effect a wide variety of automated information systems such as main frame computer applications  personal computers  communications systems  including telephone systems  and other information systems utilized by not only first midwest but also its customers and vendors 
the most significant of first midwest s automated information systems affected by the year issue are the data processing systems used to process transactions and information for loan  deposit and trust customers  and for first midwest s mortgage loan origination and servicing activities 
first midwest currently purchases the services for these systems from two nationally recognized data processing vendors 
other programs and applications used in first midwest s operations that will be affected by the year issue include building and security systems  equipment including proof machines  sorters and cash dispensers  hardware including routers  servers  printers and controllers  atm modems and computer software 
the majority of these items have been purchased from outside vendors who are responsible for maintenance of the systems and modifications to enable uninterrupted usage 
additionally  first midwest does have some in house applications  interface equipment and interfaces that must be reviewed and modified 
a detailed discussion of the state of readiness  risks  contingency plans and costs associated with first midwest s plan to address the year issue are discussed below 
state of readiness first midwest s year plan process began in april at that time  the chief information officer executive vice president of first midwest bank  na was appointed the year plan coordinator and a steering committee was formed consisting of representatives from the appropriate disciplines across the company 
the year steering committee has been meeting regularly since august the company s internal auditor is a participant at the committee meetings 
to date  first midwest has completed the initial awareness phase as well as the assessment phase  identifying all mission critical applications  vendors and external agents 
first midwest is currently on schedule for the finalization of the renovation process and the testing ie validation of hardware and software 
first midwest is substantially completed with the renovation and testing of all mission critical applications 
the remaining renovation and testing of mission critical applications will occur in the first quarter of a third party consulting firm has been retained to review the testing of year mission critical applications 
the review commenced in december and will conclude in february first midwest relies on outsourced data processing for core banking applications from two nationally recognized data processing vendors 
both vendors have advised first midwest that the computer programming language code affected by the year issue has been fully renovated and tested  and was placed in production as of october  year compliance testing of the mainframe banking applications is planned for the first quarter of this will occur with the renovated live code 
of the mission critical applications requiring renovation  approximately have been renovated and are scheduled for renovation in of the total mission critical applications  are currently compliant 
the year plan has been fully documented in a narrative format which outlines the procedures and processes used to achieve compliance 
the year plan is divided into a number of sections focusing on applications software  hardware  equipment  forms  etc  third party vendors  and customer or external agent relationships 
in march a review of the plan was conducted by a consulting firm with expertise in year compliance resulting in two recommendations for enhancement to the plan being made  both of which were implemented 
additionally during  the compliance plan and activities of both first midwest bank  na and first midwest trust company were formally reviewed by the occ  their primary bank regulator 
the year plan coordinator periodically submits written reports to the board of directors relative to the company s year plan status and compliance 
risks from year issues the predominant risk associated with the year issue for first midwest rests with the functionality of the mainframe systems 
since first midwest relies heavily on outsourced processing  the preparedness of both outside vendors are of paramount importance 
the inability of these vendors to process mainframe information would be detrimental to the company s ability to process transactions and serve customers  and for this reason  the company has entered into an agreement for contingency processing with a third nationally recognized data processing vendor in the event of year noncompliance by either primary data processing vendors 
in addition  the company closely monitors the progress of these vendors with regard to their preparedness as stated above 
the year renovated code is currently functional in the live system and has been tested by both of the primary data processing vendors 
proxy test results have been reviewed and maintained for further assurance of compliance by these two vendors 
with regard to other turnkey systems and hardware  first midwest has a program of renovation in process with testing having commenced in november with completion scheduled for february customers also present potential risk relative to their compliance with year within their own organizations 
first midwest has identified critical relationships and has initiated a plan to assess the year sufficiency of its customer base 
as of november the identified portfolio of mission critical customer relationships has been rated low on a scale of high  moderate or low year risk 
in addition  for any customers rated high risk  a follow up review is conducted every weeks  for moderate ratings a follow up review is conducted every weeks  and for low risk customers  a follow up review is conducted every ninety days 
although it is very difficult to assess or quantify the year risk level of customer relationships  the percentage of mission critical customers rated high is at year end vendors and other third party relationships are also under continuing evaluation 
first midwest relies on a number of critical vendors with whom communications relative to year risk levels are regularly reviewed 
of such vendors  one of the more critical is first midwest s outsourced item processing vendor 
that vendor  another nationally recognized data processor  is considered well advanced with its year compliance efforts 
of all third party vendors and suppliers  perhaps the most difficult assessment of year risk are utility companies  such as electrical  gas and telephone 
this is a risk that is shared by everyone and cannot be accurately quantified at this time 
contingency plans the primary contingency plan of first midwest is the contingency processing agreement with the vendor discussed above 
the purpose of this agreement is to hold a place for converting to that data processor in the event that either  or both  primary data processing vendors do not become year compliant and first midwest elects to proceed with this contingency plan 
first midwest  as part of its contingency plan  has identified the core business units and functions of the company and the associated computer applications pertinent to these core business units and functions 
trigger dates and contingency plans have been identified for each of the mission critical systems applicable to these units and functions  none of which have required execution at this time 
furthermore  first midwest has identified failure scenarios and is in the process of developing information to identify the minimum level of output and services  critical requirements tools to produce the minimum level of outputs and services and recovery plans for minimum levels of outputs and services 
as of december  the year steering committee has begun to aggressively address business resumption plans to ensure that the critical components of first midwest s operations will continue in the event of a failure scenario 
this process includes analyzing the critical risk factors and preparing in advance to mitigate such risks 
it is anticipated that business resumption risk plans will fully be in place not later than june  a formal conversion process along with a designated team of internal managers will prepare for the century turn beginning in october and respond to operational problems and issues that may arise 
this readiness process is intended to further mitigate problems and define the support structure to respond to the issues that arise after the century turn 
costs to address year issues first midwest s plan to become year compliant is being executed with internal resources  primarily through its information systems staff 
first midwest currently expects to utilize minimal contract consulting to supplement its internal staff 
as first midwest relies predominantly on outsourced vendors for most of the core applications  significant costs associated with year renovation are not expected to be experienced 
first midwest has been informed by its primary data processing vendors that they have no current expectation to pass on year compliance costs to first midwest as the service contracts with these vendors make no such provision 
as a result  the primary costs that are expected to be incurred with the year plan involve micro computer hardware replacement and upgrades  operating system upgrades  software replacement and equipment and forms upgrades 
these costs  as well as the payroll costs and consulting expenses incurred  will be expensed as incurred 
based on the year plan as currently being executed and the best available information  first midwest does not anticipate the cost to address the year issues will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

a fourth quarter special charge represented acquisition and related costs incurred in connection with the merger of sparbank 
the fourth quarter of saw a continuation of net interest margin compression and the related decline in net interest income experienced earlier in contributing to this decline were a number of factors including lower average loans outstanding  higher than average and more expensive governmental deposits and the costs of investing in corporate owned life insurance the income on which is reported as a component on noninterest income 
of these factors  the most significant was lower average loans outstanding which was attributable to i the securitizations during of million of fixed rate mortgages acquired from the heritage and sparbank portfolios  ii lower levels of non mortgage originations as a result of more stringent underwriting and administration standards adopted during  iii the outplacement from various portfolios of approximately million in loans that no longer met heightened credit standards  and iv pricing and underwriting competitive circumstances 
offsetting the decline in net interest income were increases in service charges and fees  mortgage banking revenues and higher trust and investment management fees 
additionally  a lower provision for loan losses was warranted due to the decline in loans outstanding and the increase in the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of total loans 
the cost savings related to the heritage acquisition realized in the fourth quarter of resulted in flat quarter to quarter noninterest expense which also offset the decline in net interest income

the company cautions that these statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements due to market  economic and other business related risks and uncertainties effecting the realization of such statements 
certain of these risks and uncertainties included in such forward looking statements include  without limitations  the following dynamics of the markets served in terms of competition from traditional and nontraditional financial service providers can effect both the funding capabilities of the company in terms of deposit garnering as well as the ability to compete for loans and generate the higher yielding assets necessary to improve net interest income  future legislation and actions by the federal reserve board may result in the imposition of costs and constraints on the company through higher fdic insurance premiums  significant fluctuations in market interest rates and operational limitations  significant fluctuations in market interest rates may affect the ability to reinvest proceeds from the maturities and prepayments on certain categories of securities and affect the overall yield of the portfolio  business expansion activities and other efforts to retain customers may increase the need for staffing and the resulting personnel expense in future periods  deviations from the assumptions used to evaluate the appropriate level of the reserve for loan losses as well as future purchases and sales of loans may affect the appropriate level of the reserve for loan losses and thereby affect the future levels of provisioning  the steps necessary to address the year issue include ensuring that not only first midwest s automated systems  but also those of vendors and customers  can become year compliant 
accordingly  results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results in these statements 
first midwest does not undertake  and specifically disclaims  any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements
