the company s standard sales contract may be canceled by the buyer at any time prior to closing 
the company does not recognize revenues on homes covered by such contracts until the sales are closed

the following table sets forth the company s backlog  for both homes and residential lots  at december    and  which includes homes and lots sold pursuant to the company s zero down sales program and of the backlog related to projects developed by the company s joint ventures in hawaii and washington 
december  december  december  aggregate aggregate aggregate number sales value number sales value number sales value consolidated colorado   hawaii    northern california   oregon   total consolidated    unconsolidated joint ventures hawaii    washington   colorado  total    the colorado market was added in as a result of the acquisition of melody in january colorado backlog at december  approximated units with an aggregate sales value of million 
the washington market was added in as a result of the company s acquisition of a interest in stafford in july washington backlog at december  approximated units with an aggregate sales value of million 
reflects the backlog of the company s owned joint venture in colorado  the ranch southpointe ii llc  which was entered into in july the average sales prices of the homes and lots comprising backlog for consolidated projects at december   and were   and  respectively 
the lower average sales prices in and relative to primarily reflects an increase in the number of homes sold in the company s mainland us divisions as a result of the strength of the housing markets in those areas  where the average sales prices are lower than in hawaii  which made up of the backlog in the increase in backlog in colorado from to reflects a higher rate of new home sales 
these improvements are related to a greater number of projects under development and a strong overall housing market in the denver metropolitan area 
the california and oregon divisions backlog increased as a result of a greater number of projects under development in as compared to due to the ability of buyers to cancel their sales contracts  no assurance can be given that homes in backlog will result in actual closings 
variability of results  other factors the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant variability in sales and net income 
factors that contribute to variability of the company s results include the timing of home closings  a substantial portion of which historically have occurred in the last month of each quarter  the company s ability to continue to acquire additional land on favorable terms for future developments  the condition of the real estate markets and economies in which the company operates  the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry and changes in prevailing interest rates  costs of material and labor  and delays in construction schedules caused by timing of inspections and approval by regulatory agencies  including zoning approvals  building permits and receipt of entitlements  the timing of completion of necessary public infrastructure  the timing of utility hookups and adverse weather conditions 
the company s historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and  in general  the company s financial results will vary from development to development  and from fiscal quarter to fiscal quarter 
in addition  the company believes that the market price of its common stock may at times be adversely affected due to the company s relatively small size when compared to certain other publicly traded national homebuilding firms 
the company further believes that the price of its common stock may be adversely affected due to the relatively low trading volume for its shares 
year compliance the company has developed and is currently executing a plan designed to make its computer systems year compliant 
the plan covers four stages including i inventory  ii assessment  iii remediation  and iv testing 
the company has substantially completed the inventory  assessment and remediation stages for its systems and applications 
the company has started its testing of these systems and applications  and expects to complete such testing by mid the company currently estimates that approximately  will be incurred to address year issues 
as of december   approximately  has been incurred and expensed 
the company anticipates that its year costs will be funded from operations  and does not expect to defer any other information technology projects as a result of its year efforts 
the company does not anticipate the year issue will have material adverse effects on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
however  the failure of any internal system to achieve year readiness could result in material disruption to the company s operations 
the company has also initiated discussions with parties with whom it does business to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems impact the company s operations 
the company is assessing the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should these organizations fail to properly remediate the computer systems 
although the company believes that alternative sources of labor and materials will be available  there can be no assurance that the inability of the company s key subcontractors and suppliers to attain year compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the business operations and financial performance of the company 
even where assurances are received from third parties there remains a risk that failure of systems and products of other companies on which the company relies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company is materially reliant on third parties with respect to its ability to collect sales proceeds and pay its vendors and employees 
such third parties include governmental agencies in various jurisdictions that record the conveyance of property  title and escrow companies  banks and payroll processing firms 
the company intends to create a contingency plan once responses from such third parties to questionnaires have been received and evaluated 
the costs of year compliance and the foregoing statements are based upon management s best estimates at the present time  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected programs  the rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs and the success of the company s external customers and suppliers in addressing the year issue 
the company s evaluation is on going and it expects that new and different information will become available to it as that evaluation continues 
consequently  there is no guarantee that all material elements will be year ready in time 
liquidity and capital resources the company uses its liquidity and capital resources to  among other things  i support its operations including its inventories of homes  home sites and land  ii provide working capital  iii fund market expansion  including acquisitions  investments in and advances to joint ventures  and start up operations  and iv make interest payments on outstanding debt 
capital resources the company anticipates continuing to acquire land for use in its future homebuilding operations  including finished lots and partially developed land 
the company currently intends to acquire a portion of the land inventories required in future periods through takedowns of lots subject to option contracts entered into in prior periods and under new option contracts 
the use of option contracts lessens the company s land related risk and improves liquidity 
because of increased demand for partially developed and finished lots in certain of the markets where the company builds homes  the company s ability to acquire lots using option contracts has been reduced or has become more expensive 
in connection with the purchase of its interest in stafford  the company entered into an agreement to make loans available to stafford in an aggregate principal amount of up to million increased from million as of june  
in addition  the company had an option to purchase the remaining interest in stafford based on a pre determined formula  subject to certain contingencies 
in january  the company increased its ownership interest in stafford to and refinanced stafford s existing debt 
as of december   stafford s total assets were approximately million and notes payable were approximately million  of which million was outstanding to the company 
the company anticipates that it will acquire the remaining interest in stafford in january the company anticipates that it has adequate financial resources to satisfy its current and near term capital requirements based on its current capital resources and additional liquidity available under existing credit agreements 
the company believes that it can meet its long term capital needs including  among other things  meeting future debt payments and refinancing or paying off other long term debt as it becomes due from operations and external financing sources  assuming that no significant adverse changes in the company s business  or general economic conditions  occur as a result of the various risk factors described elsewhere herein  in particular  increases in interest rates 
lines of credit and notes payable on may   the company consummated its offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  which are due april  the company received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million net of discounts and estimated offering costs of approximately million 
the company used such proceeds to repay a portion of the company s borrowings under its line of credit 
the offering costs will be amortized over the term of the notes using the interest method 
in april  the company amended certain provisions of its revolving credit facility to provide for the issuance of the senior notes 
effective september   the company reduced the amount of its revolving credit facility from million to million 
the company has a one time option to increase the amount of the facility to million 
in addition  the company has a one time option to reduce the amount of the facility by million on an irrevocable basis  provided the facility has been increased to million for at least six months 
the revolving credit facility expires on july  and includes an option for the lenders to extend the term for an additional year as of july of each year 
the company can select an interest rate based on either libor   or month term or prime for each borrowing 
based on the company s leverage ratio  as defined  the interest rate may vary from libor plus to or prime plus to 
the revolving credit facility contains covenants  including certain financial covenants and also contains provisions which may  in certain circumstances  limit the amount the company may borrow 
at december   million of the company s line of credit was unused  of which million is restricted to withdrawal for specific project costs and letters of credit 
the company has no material commitments or off balance sheet financing arrangements that would tend to affect future liquidity 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit facilities will provide adequate cash to fund the company s operations at least through however  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing within this time frame 
the company may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or respond to unanticipated requirements 
the company may seek to raise additional funds through private or public sales of debt or equity securities  bank debt  or otherwise 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to the company  or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company has limited its market risk on million of its revolving credit facility by entering into an interest rate swap agreement  which converts floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
this derivative financial instrument is used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
as an example  based upon the company s average bank borrowings of million during  if the interest rate indexes on which the company s bank borrowing rates are based were to increase basis points in  interest incurred would increase and cash flows would decrease in by  which amount reflects the effect on interest on the portion of the bank borrowings in excess of the million under the interest rate swap agreement 
a portion of the increased interest would be expensed as a period cost in  while the balance would be capitalized to real estate inventories and be expensed as a component of the cost of residential real estate sales in and future years
