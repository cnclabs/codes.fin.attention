the gaap loss and lae ratio increased to in from in this point increase reflects a million charge for reserve strengthening which added points to the gaap loss and lae ratio 
this reserve strengthening was required for three reasons less favorable than anticipated development of prior year reserves  unexpected increases in recent claims activity on several large programs  and an increase in projected ultimate loss ratios for the most recent accident years due to pricing pressure experienced in the commercial property casualty market 
the remaining point increase reflects increased expected loss ratios going forward to reflect these competitive market conditions 
the gaap loss and lae ratio was and in and  respectively  a point increase 
on a pro forma basis  as if the connecticut surety reinsurance ceding arrangement on the surety program had occurred at the beginning of  the gaap loss and lae ratio would have been in this change reflects favorable claims experience primarily in workers compensation based programs and residual markets

these reductions were offset by incremental costs of million related to acquisitions 
other operating expense from the surety business decreased million to million in from million in this decrease reflects the run off of the surety business and the increase in ceding commissions 
taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  million in and million in  representing effective tax rates of  and in    respectively 
the tax rates were significantly lower than the corporate rate due to the company s heavily tax exempt investment portfolio 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in reflects an unusually low proportion of underwriting and fee based income in relation to net investment income 
the increase in the effective tax rate in reflects the higher proportion of underwriting and risk management service income in relation to net investment income 
liquidity and capital resources the principal sources of funds for the company are insurance premiums  investment income  proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets  risk management fees and agency commissions 
funds are primarily used for the payment of claims  commissions  salaries and employee benefits  and other operating expenses 
in addition  the company has a high volume of intercompany transactions due to the payment of management fees by the insurance subsidiaries to the risk management subsidiaries 
such fees are subject to regulatory approval by state insurance departments

this letter of credit is being used as security for the insurance subsidiary s obligations under a reinsurance agreement  and is added to the outstanding balance under the company s million unsecured line of credit to determine availability of funds under the line 
in addition  one subsidiary had a secured line of credit with a bank which permits borrowings up to of the accounts receivable which secure the line

this line bears interest at under the prime rate prime was at december

as of december  and  the recorded values of the company s investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents  were million and million  respectively 
the company s investment portfolio consists primarily of tax exempt fixed income securities of varying maturities 
the investment portfolio  at december   was invested in investment grade a or above bonds as defined by s p 
during  the company expects to increase its position in equity securities by approximately million 
shareholders equity was million  or per common share  at december   compared to million at december   or per common share 
the increase in shareholders equity during reflects earnings  dividends  stock repurchases and an increase of million in the fair values of available for sale debt and equity securities 
changes in shareholders equity related to the unrealized values of underlying portfolio investments will continue to be volatile as market prices of debt securities fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment 
a significant portion of the company s consolidated assets represents assets of the company s insurance subsidiaries that may not be transferable to the holding company in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
the restriction on the transferability to the holding company from its insurance subsidiaries is limited by michigan regulatory guidelines which are as follows the maximum discretionary dividend that may be declared  based on data from the preceding calendar year  is the greater of the insurance company s net income excluding realized capital gains or ten percent of the insurance company s policyholders surplus excluding unrealized gains 
these dividends are further limited by a clause in the michigan law which prohibits an insurer from declaring dividends except out of earned surplus earnings of the company 
since star is the parent insurance company  its maximum dividend calculation represents the combined insurance companies 
based upon the statutory financial statements of star insurance company  as of january  star may not pay any dividend to the company  without prior approval of the michigan commissioner of insurance 
on december   the commissioner approved payment of a  dividend to the company  which was used to increase the paid in capital and surplus of williamsburg 
no dividends were paid or returned in and the insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain certain deposits with regulatory authorities which totaled million at december   and million at december  regulatory issues insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests eg premium to statutory surplus ratios which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies 
the company has recently changed its objective to maintain a gross written premium to statutory surplus at or below to to at or below to this change reflects the impact of both the fronting and risk sharing program business in comparison to the composition of a traditional meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued insurer who does not have significant fronting nor risk sharing business 
the traditional insurers do tend to drive industry standards 
the company s target for net written premium to statutory surplus remains at or below to for  premium leverage ratios were to and to on a gross and net premium written basis  respectively 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is to be used as a tool to identify weakly capitalized companies 
at december  and  star insurance company  the parent insurance company had a rbc ratio that exceeded applicable risk based capital requirements 
at december  and  star s statutory surplus was million and million  respectively  the threshold requiring regulatory involvement was million in and million in reinsurance considerations the company seeks to manage the risk exposure of its insurance subsidiaries and its clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
the company s reinsurance requirements are analyzed on a specific program basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
the company secures this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of its reinsurers 
in its selection of reinsurers  the company evaluates the financial stability of its prospective reinsurers 
to date  the company has not experienced any material difficulties in collecting reinsurance recoverables 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of the company s reinsurers to meet their obligations 
the following table sets forth information relating to the company s five largest reinsurers other than client captive quota share reinsurers as of december  reinsurance premium ceded am best reinsurer december  rating in thousands evergreen national indemnity company  a employers reinsurance corporation  a connecticut surety group  not rated risk capital reinsurance company  a scor reinsurance company  a in its risk sharing programs  the company is also subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by its clients captive insurers on the portion of risk exposure ceded to such captives 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective captive insurers is one of the factors considered by the company in entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
the company secures reinsurance balances due from its non admitted reinsurers through funds withheld trusts or letters of credit 
dependence on key programs the company provides alternative risk management programs and services to certain large client groups and associations and then markets them to their individual members 
in  and in  the company s top four programs  excluding the surety bond business  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total revenue on an actual basis 
the loss or cancellation of any of the company s significant meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued programs by the relevant client groups  or the general availability of commercial market coverage to members of such groups on more favorable terms than provided under the company s programs  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has multiple year contracts with many of its clients and has maintained retention rates in the mid to high range 
year computer systems compliance the year issue has come about as a result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the year in a date record 
if the company s computer systems were not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year instead of this mistake could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  but not limited to  a temporary inability to process transactions  send policies or invoices or engage in other  similar business activity 
projects and state of readiness the company recognized the issues associated with the year problem in  and began a series of system replacements and upgrades to address the problem 
subsequent to the initial assessment of systems  the company purchased a number of new entities  many of which had non compliant systems 
these systems are included in the company s year efforts 
many of the system replacements and upgrades  provided the company with dual purpose benefits in the form of new business functionality and year compliance 
the company and each of its operating subsidiaries are in the process of implementing a year compliance plan 
the company also created a corporate level steering committee to guide and monitor year readiness 
the company follows a step compliance plan which consists of the following steps i investigate and inventory the assets  ii analyze the problems and prioritize  iii repair  replace  or retire the asset  iv test the changes at a unit and system level  and  v implement into production 
following this process  the company has completed major phases by replacing and upgrading many of its operational systems and processors 
the company has identified its significant service providers  vendors  suppliers  customers and governmental entities  and has ascertained their year readiness through questionnaires  interviews and visits 
the project recognizes that date sensitive systems may fail at different points in time depending on their function 
for example  forward looking policy systems may fail earlier and therefore received corrective action sooner 
substantial numbers of the company s operational systems are provided by third parties in either executable form or modifiable form only  and the third parties have provided year replacement code 
the company feels that of its critical operational systems have been brought into compliance  with compliance expected by the rd quarter of substantial portions of the year project are staffed with the company s internal resources 
the company has engaged outside contractors to assist with some year problem identification and remediation 
the company is also engaging an outside contractor to re assess the corrected systems  identify problem areas and assist in final testing for year compliance 
the company is developing departmental contingency plans for all critical business systems 
the company will continue to assess the need for formal contingency plans  based upon progress of year efforts  and results of the final testing 
costs the total cost associated with required actions necessary to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
the total estimated cost  from inception  of the necessary activities is currently estimated at million 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued amounts expended in include about million to outside vendors to repair  upgrade or replace software and hardware problems and about million in internal costs for planning  assessment and reprogramming incurred in the year effort 
amounts expected to be spent in total about million  including about million in outside vendor costs and another in internal reprogramming and assessment costs 
risks and contingencies the company works on year compliance efforts with a priority based upon their significance to the operations of the company 
those systems which are most critical to the company are the focus of our current efforts 
the year project team is aggressively addressing these issues to ensure that all critical functions operate after the year however  some non critical systems or systems beyond the control of the company may potentially suffer some yk related failures 
the company s efforts are designed to ensure that all of our critical business systems  and our ability to operate  will not be significantly effected by the year issue 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party service providers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results 
the year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year issue  as well as the readiness of its external agents 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems  the remediation efforts  and completion of the year project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which is effective for fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
as the company does not use derivative instruments  the management of the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have an effect on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting by insurance and other enterprises for insurance related assessments sop 
sop provides guidance for determining when an entity should recognize a liability for guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments  how to measure that liability  and when an asset may be recognized for the recovery of such assessments through premium tax offsets or policy surcharges 
this sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   and the effect of initial adoption is to be reported as a cumulative catch up adjustment 
restatement of previously issued financial statements is not allowed 
the company has not yet determined the impact that sop will have on its consolidated financial statements and expects to implement it in meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded 
the following discussion of the company s primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  the company s market risk sensitive instruments are limited to debt securities and equity securities which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of asset and liability management where the target duration of investment portfolio is managed to approximate that of the liabilities as determined by actuarial analysis 
the fair value of company s investment portfolio was million  of which is invested in debt securities 
the company s market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
the company s exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
the company s investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings through significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
for the company s investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  the company does not anticipate significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in its sensitivity model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss of debt securities assuming an upward parallel shift basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair values 
based upon this sensitivity model  a basis point change in interest rates produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately million 
this loss in fair value only reflects the impact of interest rate increases on the fair value of the company s debt securities  which constitute of total assets 
the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model do not produce a material loss in fair values
