fiscal net sales improved from fiscal by  or 
the decline in the current fiscal year s net sales reflects weakness in demand and price pressure during the first three fiscal quarters primarily as a result of the asian economic crisis

gross margin the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales was   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decline in gross margin in fiscal is the result of the decline in net sales as discussed above and increased manufacturing depreciation expense partly due to the acquisition of the six inch submicron wafer fabrication facility 
research and development research and development expenses were   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal is attributable primarily to the process development agreement pda that the company has with orbit semiconductor which will allow faster process transfer from the company s four inch fabrication processes to the company s newly acquired six inch submicron wafer fabrication facility 
the pda extends up to the first quarter for fiscal the company expects the number of research and development projects to increase during fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  the selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively the same as the previous year but the decline in net sales amount caused the percentage to increase less than 
the company expects that dollar expenditures in selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of the new six inch wafer fabrication facility  although the percentage to net sales may not increase 
write off of in process technology the company incurred a non cash  non tax deductible charge to operations of million for the write off of in process technology related to the acquisition of assets from orbit technology in february  because the technological feasibility of the in process technology acquired had not been established and there was no alternative future use

background 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems and software products as the millennium year approaches 
the year or yk problem is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or could cause them to fail 
as a result  many companies software  computer systems and other equipment may need to be reprogrammed or replaced in order to comply with such yk requirements 
assessment 
the yk problem could affect computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company 
accordingly  the company has been reviewing its internal computer programs and systems to ensure that they will be yk compliant in a timely manner 
it is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test the systems for yk compliance 
the company s yk readiness program is divided into five major sections  namely  enterprise resource planning erp systems  pc systems and applications  shop floor control system  the facilities systems  and third party suppliers and customers 
the inventory and priority assessment phases of each section of the programs have been completed 
the testing phases of the program are being performed by the company 
it is anticipated that all reprogramming efforts will be completed by september  for the other sections  a six month safety net has been built into our yk readiness program to allow for any possible unplanned or unscheduled occurrence that may need to be remedied prior to the millennium 
as a part of the yk readiness program  the company has purchased and is implementing a shop floor control system called mesa software from camstar systems  inc this will replace the existing work in process tracking system 
implementation of mesa is on schedule and is expected to be completed by mid remaining business software programs and computer systems are expected to be yk compliant through the yk readiness program including those supplied by vendors or they will be retired 
it is important to note that supertex  inc products are not date sensitive 
suppliers and customers 
as part of the yk readiness program  the company has identified primary vendors  service providers and customers that are believed to be critical to its business operations 
steps are being undertaken to reasonably ascertain their stage of yk readiness through questionnaires  interviews and other available means 
the process of evaluating these third party business partners began on july  and is scheduled for completion by mid  with follow up reviews scheduled through the remainder of however  the company has limited or no control over the actions of these third parties 
thus  while the company does not anticipate any significant yk problems  there can be no assurance that these third party entities will resolve any or all yk problems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the company or any of its customers 
any failure of these third parties to resolve their yk problems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
costs 
it is currently estimated that the aggregate cost of the company s yk project is approximately  including the cost of implementing the new shop floor control system  mesa  estimated to be approximately  substantially all of which would be capitalized 
other non yk information technology projects have not been materially delayed or impacted by the company s yk initiatives 
contingency plans 
the company is currently developing contingency plans intended to mitigate possible disruption in business operations that may result from the yk issue 
the company s objective is to complete its initial contingency planning by june  contingency plans may include increasing inventory levels of raw materials  securing alternate sources of supply and distribution  accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  short to medium term use of backup equipment and software  increased work hours for company personnel  additional staffing  manual workarounds and other appropriate measures 
risks 
the company s yk readiness program is an ongoing process and the risk assessments and estimates of costs and completion dates for the various components of the yk readiness program described above are forward looking statements and are subject to change 
factors that may cause changes include among others the continued availability and cost of programming and testing resources  ability to identify and remediate all yk problems  the timely implementation of yk ready systems  the timely conversion by third parties of their equipment and proprietary software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review 
although preliminary estimates indicate that the yk issue will not have a material impact on the company  there can be no assurance that the yk issues  due to the above factors or other unforeseen consequences  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its investment securities 
the company has no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
the company anticipates interest on cash balances for to be approximately  at an estimated average interest rate of
