as a result of several factors  the number and dollar volume of taxi loans originated by the company have not increased 
the factors which contributed to this included an increased competition for taxi loans  and more alternative loan products 
these other products often provide prospective borrowers with interest only rates  which the company does not provide 
the current lower interest rate environment and increased lending competition have reduced the spread between the rate at which the company lends funds and the cost of such funds 
there can be no assurance that the company will experience increased spreads in the foreseeable future 
in some cases  the increased level of lending competition has resulted in interest rates considerable more aggressive than those offered by the company 
in order to maintain a quality portfolio  the company has and will continue to adhere to its historical underwriting criteria 
accordingly  certain loan origination opportunities which do not meet the company s underwriting criteria will not be funded by the company
