item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for each of the three years ended december  and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december  the financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil and gas sold  the type and volume of oil and gas produced and the results of acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration activities 
the average realized prices for oil and gas will fluctuate from one period to another due to world and regional market conditions and other factors 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on the success of development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves pursuant to current reservoir management 
production rates  steam costs net of electricity revenue  labor  maintenance expenses and production taxes are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period based on the foregoing principal factors  among others 
results of operations net income for was million  down million  or  from million in and million  or from million in for the fourth quarter of  net income was a loss of million  down million and million from million in the fourth quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of  respectively 
although the company maintained good cost discipline in  profitability decreased due to a very negative pricing environment for crude oil 
the following table presents certain operating data for the years ended december   and net production boe per day    per boe average sales price operating costs production taxes 


total operating costs dd a g a 
excluding production taxes 
operating income from producing operations was million in  down million and million  respectively  from million in and million in due to the significant decline in oil prices in compared to the prior years 
the average sales price boe received in was  or below the average of in and lower than the average of for world oil prices declined sharply in early the average posting for midway sunset crude oil which began the year at had reached by march  although postings rebounded slightly for short periods during the balance of  the average posted price during december was only and the average posted price has remained at very low levels in oil and gas production of  boe day in was boe day  or lower than production of  boe day in  but  boe day  or higher than production of  boe day 
the decrease in production from was primarily related to the reduction of steam injection and reduced capital expenditures on the company s midway sunset properties 
this reduction was necessitated by the poor crude oil pricing environment 
the increases in production compared to were primarily related to production from and development of acquisitions made in the latter part of the company continued to achieve excellent cost control in operating costs for the year averaged boe  down from boe in both and many factors contributed to the positive results achieved in this area 
the company s management correctly interpreted the decline in oil prices as a long term event and moved quickly to reduce costs and protect the cash flow of the company 
an across the board salary reduction was implemented and selected personnel reductions were made 
steam production from higher cost sources such as conventional steam generation and cogeneration plant duct firing was eliminated or significantly reduced 
the number of well service rigs was reduced and some low producing wells were shut in 
in addition  production taxes began to decline in the second half of due to lower oil property valuations 
also  the price of cogeneration steam was lower than primarily because of lower gas prices 
dd a boe increased to in  up from in and from in the increase is due to higher depreciation related to additional facilities and a higher basis related to the cumulative effect of recent capital budgets 
the company purchased certain properties in the midway sunset field in the third quarter of for million in cash 
the acquisition included four producing properties and a steam purchase contract from an on site  non owned cogeneration plant 
these properties currently produce approximately bpd and the company believes that additional development opportunities on these properties are available 
on december   the company recorded a million pre tax impairment charge relating to non producing properties in kern county due to the low year end oil price of barrel 
included in the gain loss on sale of assets is a charge of 
million which represents the write off of a receivable and related legal expenses incurred to collect amounts owed from the sale of its rincon properties 
included in the gain loss on sale of assets is a gain of million resulting from the sale of certain non core properties in that year 
general interest expense in was million  down from million in  but up significantly from 
million in the company did not capitalize interest expense in any of these periods 
the reduction from was due to the reduction in debt in both and and generally lower borrowing rates in the company did not have long term debt until the borrowings were made pursuant to the acquisitions made in the latter part of interest and dividend income was 
million in  up from 
million in  but down from million in g a was million in  down and  respectively  from million in and million in on a per boe basis  g a decreased to 
from in and in in light of the severe market conditions faced by the company in early  several steps were initiated to reduce and control costs 
an across the board salary reduction  with certain members of management taking even higher reductions  was implemented in march of simultaneously  reductions were made in the number of employees 
these two factors accounted for approximately million of the g a savings as compared to the salaries were reinstated effective january  in addition  the company experienced lower compensation related to the exercise of stock options by employees and directors and also lower medical claims 
the company s effective income tax rate in was  down from and in and  respectively 
the lower rate in was due primarily to the impact of certain tax benefits  primarily eor credits and percentage depletion  applied against lower income in compared to and the company expects that its effective rate will remain significantly below the rate it achieved in if the current low oil price environment continues 
in december  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
as required by this new standard  the company reports two earnings per share amounts  basic net income per share and diluted net income per share 
basic net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders the numerator by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding the denominator 
the computation of diluted net income per share is similar to the computation of basic net income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the dilutive effect of the additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all convertible securities had been converted to common shares during the period 
also  during the company adopted the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities and sfas no 
 accounting for transfer and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the adoption of these two pronouncements had no material impact on the financial statements of the company 
during  the company implemented the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement sets forth alternative standards for recognition of the cost of stock based compensation and requires that a company s financial statements include certain disclosures about stock based employee compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to account for them 
as allowed in this statement  the company continues to apply accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in recording compensation related to its plans 
the supplemental disclosure requirements and further information related to the company s stock option plans are presented in note to the company s financial statements 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources working capital as of december  was million  down from million at december  and up from million at december  cash flow from operations in was million  down and  respectively  from million in and million in the decrease in cash flow in was primarily due to a decrease in the average sales price of heavy crude oil and a decrease in production 
working capital decreased in from  primarily because internal cash flows paid a portion  but not all  of the cost of million in capital expenditures  the payment of million in dividends  the retirement of million in long term debt and the cost of property acquisitions of million 
the company s capital budget included the drilling of development wells  remedial work on a number of other wells and million in improvements to surface facilities 
on december   the company established a million unsecured revolving credit facility with nationsbank  na as of december   the borrowing base was million 
on january   the company amended its credit agreement and established a new borrowing base of million and included two additional banks in its syndication 
the primary purpose of this amendment was to increase the borrowing base and to fund the placerita acquisition 
the company is carrying million in long term debt under this credit facility as of february  the total proved reserves at december  were million boe  down from million boe at december  and million boe at december  the decrease in was primarily related to production of million barrels and the reduction of million barrels deemed uneconomic at the december  oil price of barrel  partially offset by the acquisition of approximately million barrels of reserves in properties adjacent to the company s south midway sunset properties 
the company s present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes  discounted at  was million at december   down substantially from million and million at december  and december   respectively 
this decline is also primarily related to the decline in oil prices 
the values were based on year end oil prices of  and per boe for  and  respectively 
year in  the company began a review of its computer hardware  software applications and process control equipment with embedded semiconductor chips to determine which components  if any  would not function correctly in the years and beyond 
in the third quarter of  the company created a year yk team to monitor the results of the review on an ongoing basis to better ensure that the company s operations will not experience any material adverse effects when the year arrives 
as part of the review  started in  the company determined that its accounting software would have to be modified or replaced 
the company has identified new software that is represented to be yk compliant 
two modules were replaced in the first half of the remaining modules are scheduled to be replaced during the first nine months of the total cost of the software and hardware purchased to complete the installation is estimated to be approximately 
million 
if  for some reason  the software cannot be purchased and installed by the year  the company intends to modify its existing software to handle yk 
these modifications would be made by the company s in house information systems personnel 
the company has evaluated all of its other software  which is predominantly purchased from third party providers  and determined that they are substantially yk compliant as of the end of the company has performed an evaluation of its computer hardware and determined that with only a few minor exceptions  it is yk compliant at this time 
minor upgrades were completed on some of the equipment to make them compliant at no material cost to the company 
the company has made inquiries to the operator of the company s two cogeneration facilities to ensure that all equipment is yk compliant 
these facilities provide over two thirds of the company s steam  which is necessary to produce the company s heavy oil reserves 
the company has been informed by the operator that the facilities are yk compliant at this time 
if  by the year  the cogeneration facilities are not compliant  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s production volumes and results of operations 
if the plants were shut down  the company would fire its conventional generators  which would result in a lower volume of steam at a higher cost to the company 
however  the company believes such action will not be necessary and is confident that the facilities will be compliant when the year arrives 
facilities and equipment at the placerita properties acquired in february and the non owned cogeneration facilities which provide additional steam to the placerita and south midway sunset properties will be evaluated during the first half of the company s customers are predominantly major oil companies or large independent refiners 
if any of these customers were not yk compliant by the end of and could not buy the company s crude oil  it could have a material impact on the company s operations 
the company s operations could also be impacted if the pipeline companies that transport the crude oil or if any of the utility or critical service providers were not yk compliant and could not provide their products and services 
however  management anticipates that these companies will be ready and  therefore  the company s operations will not be materially impacted when the year arrives 
the company has communicated with the financial institutions that are business partners of the company 
it is anticipated that they will be yk compliant by the year resulting in no material impact to the company 
if any of the company s other business partners are not yk compliant by the year  management does not believe it will have a material impact on the company s operations 
future developments on february   the company completed the acquisition of the placerita oilfield producing properties and a megawatt duel turbine cogeneration facility from a large california oil producer for million 
the producing properties contain approximately million barrels of proven reserves of degree gravity crude oil 
production on the properties is enhanced primarily through the use of steam drive methods 
the power from both turbines at the cogeneration facility is sold under so contracts 
this facility generates economical steam available for the property and lowers operating costs substantially 
the company began operating the property on december   and continues to integrate the operations 
due to the continuing historic low crude oil prices received by the company in early  the company is operating under an austere capital budget 
in addition  the company estimates that it has shut in approximately bpd of production due to poor economics 
as oil prices improve  it is likely that the company will return to production these shut in wells and may increase its capital budget as cash flow allows 
deregulation of the electricity generation market in california may have a positive or negative impact on the company s future steam costs as electricity prices somewhat de couple from natural gas prices 
as of december   the company s electricity price received for sales from the two cogeneration plants owned by the company correlates directly with natural gas prices 
therefore  our net steam costs are fairly consistent between quarters and years 
in the future  electricity prices will be determined by not only the cost of natural gas  but also the cost of coal  hydroelectric  nuclear and other sources of fuel 
in addition  power consumption demand may make electricity prices more volatile than in the past 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant in recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states
