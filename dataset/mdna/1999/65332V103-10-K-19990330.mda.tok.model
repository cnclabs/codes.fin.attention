operating revenues operating revenues include service revenues  which consist primarily of charges for airtime usage and monthly network access fees from providing mobile wireless services  as well as revenue from sales of analog equipment and accessories 
in  domestic operating revenues increased  million and international operating revenues increased million compared to domestic operating revenues for increased from principally as a result of a increase in end of period domestic digital subscriber units in service from about  at december   to about  at december  the increase in operating revenues primarily reflects the increased number of subscriber units in service in both new and existing markets and an increase in minutes of use producing an increase in the average monthly revenue per digital subscriber unit from about in to about in the growth in digital subscriber units in service is the result of a number of factors  including principally nextel s increased sales force and marketing staff  increased distribution channels  expanded network capacity  increased consumer awareness and acceptance of wireless communications and pricing plans targeted at particular market segments 
international operating revenues increased primarily as a result of increased units in service in brazil  argentina and mexico  chiefly due to the launch of digital services in major markets in those countries during the second half of the average churn rate for the domestic digital mobile network operations has increased from about per month in to about per month in during the fourth quarter of  the average monthly churn rate was about as compared to about for the fourth quarter of b 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of network operating costs and interconnection fees assessed by local exchange carriers 
in  domestic cost of revenues increased million and international cost of revenues increased million or compared to domestic cost of revenues for increased from primarily as a result of an increase in the number of switches placed in service and a greater than increase in cell sites and related equipment activated by nextel during  as well as increases in airtime usage and digital subscriber units in service 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased from for to for this improvement primarily resulted from economies of scale achieved as a result of increases in system usage and digital subscriber units placed in service during c 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for over consisted of an increase in domestic expenses of million and an increase in international expenses of million 
selling and marketing expenses for increased by or million and decreased as a percentage of revenue from in to in the increase in selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of increased costs incurred in connection with higher consolidated sales of digital subscriber units including million of increased domestic dealer commissions and residuals earned by indirect distributors as a result of increased unit sales through  and increased reliance on  indirect distribution channels  million of increased losses generated from consolidated sales of digital subscriber units and related accessories including a loss of million relating to international digital subscriber unit sales  million of increased domestic salaries  commissions and related personnel costs associated with increased internal sales and marketing staffing  million of increased domestic advertising  telemarketing and other marketing expenses attributable to the aggressive national and regional marketing campaigns that began in march and largely continued through most of  and million of increased advertising and marketing expenses related to international operations as a result of the launch of digital service in sao paulo and buenos aires in the second quarter of and rio de janeiro and mexico city in the third quarter nextel offers digital subscriber units and related accessories at competitive prices  which are below cost  as an incentive for new customers to subscribe to its services and for certain existing customers to remain subscribers 
nextel includes the loss generated from the sale of digital subscriber units and related accessories in selling and marketing expenses  as the loss primarily represents marketing costs 
the loss on digital subscriber unit and related accessory sales for increased to million  compared to million for and decreased as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in the loss on digital subscriber unit and related accessory sales compares favorably to the increases in end of period domestic digital subscriber units in service due to decreases in subsidies and discounts on a per unit basis offered to customers purchasing digital subscriber units and related accessories 
competitive market pressures are expected to result in a continued trend of negative gross margins on digital subscriber unit and related accessory sales as nextel anticipates that it will continue to offer customers subsidies and or discounts in connection with the sale and installation of digital subscriber units and related accessories 
general and administrative expenses for increased by or million but decreased as a percentage of operating revenues from in to in 
the increase is attributable to the following million of increased personnel  facilities and general corporate expenses reflecting increased staffing for back office activities  million of increased general and administrative expenses to support the growth of international operations  million of increased expenses related to billing and collection activities as a result of a larger customer base  and million of increased consolidated bad debt expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase both domestically and internationally as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to continuing aggressive marketing campaigns  increasing sales and marketing  customer care and back office support staffing  and increasing subsidies associated with the sale of additional digital subscriber units  related accessories and network service 
d 
bad debt expense nextel recognized consolidated bad debt expense of million for the year ended december  of which million is attributable to nextel international compared to million for the year ended december  of which million was attributable to nextel international 
nextel initiated a comprehensive and aggressive program for more stringent credit reviews and the collection of past due receivables in the second half of with respect to its domestic operations  including involuntarily disconnecting certain non paying customer accounts 
as a result of such initiatives  bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues  including both operating revenues and digital equipment revenues classified within selling and marketing expense  decreased from for to for e 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from to consisted of an increase in depreciation expense of million offset by a decrease in amortization expense of million 
depreciation expense for increased to million  compared to million for this increase reflects the effect of activating additional operational cell sites and switches in new and existing domestic and international markets  and the effect of business acquisitions completed during and the last quarter of system assets relating to the development and expansion of the digital mobile network represent the largest portion of capital expenditures during the period 
depreciation of such assets begins upon commencement of commercial service in the relevant markets 
effective october   nextel changed the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets  including licenses issued by the fcc and the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired related to domestic acquisitions  from to years to better reflect the period over which the economic benefits of such assets will be realized 
accordingly  amortization expense for decreased to million  as compared to million for f 
interest expense  interest income and other the increase in interest expense for from resulted from nextel s and nextel international s issuance of senior notes during and  as well as a higher average level of borrowings under the bank credit agreement and nextel international s bank and vendor credit facilities 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on the total outstanding debt which was a result of the refinancing of the domestic vendor credit facility during the first quarter of and the retirement of a portion of the targeted notes during the fourth quarter of and substantially all of the remaining targeted notes during the second quarter of in april  nextel purchased million in book value of its notes and million in book value of its notes at a cost in excess of related carrying amounts 
accordingly  nextel recorded an extraordinary loss of million related to the early retirement of debt 
this extraordinary loss represented the difference between the purchase price and the book value of those targeted notes on the date of purchase plus unamortized deferred financing costs 
the increase in interest income for from is primarily attributable to income recognized on the investment of the net proceeds received from nextel s sale of the series e preferred and the public notes issued in february in the fourth quarter of  nextel entered into an interest rate protection agreement to lock in interest rates on year us treasury notes in anticipation of a future debt issuance 
during the quarter ended september   management determined that this anticipated transaction was not likely to occur before the interest rate protection agreement expiration date 
the interest rate protection agreement was terminated on september  and about million was recognized as other expense within nextel s statement of operations for the quarter ended september  nextel recorded an income tax benefit of million an effective tax rate of in  compared to a provision of million an effective tax rate of in a change in the tax law for extended the net operating loss carryforward period from to years for losses generated in or after income tax benefits in were derived primarily from the recognition of net operating losses generated in that can be carried forward twenty years and that can be recognized against existing deferred tax liabilities 
in certain circumstances  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  limits the recognition of income tax benefits for net operating losses to the amount of deferred tax liabilities that are expected to reverse within the statutory carryforward period 
nextel increased its valuation allowance related to net operating losses by million in and million in since a significant portion of nextel s deferred tax liabilities will reverse after existing net operating losses expire 
the financial statement limitation on the recognition of income tax benefits for net operating losses will not have an impact on nextel s ability to utilize its net operating losses for income tax purposes 
nextel anticipates that the income tax benefit to be recognized in will decrease significantly from the income tax benefit recognized in year ended december  vs 
year ended december  a 
operating revenues operating revenues for the year ended december  increased compared to primarily attributable to the increase in digital subscriber units in service from about  at december  to about  at december  operating revenues did not keep pace with the rate of increase in digital subscriber units primarily because about two thirds of the new customers were added in the last half of the increase in operating revenues reflects the commencement of digital mobile network service in certain markets and increased sales in markets in which digital mobile network services are provided 
key factors contributing to nextel s customer growth include increased sales force and marketing staff  increased distribution channels  expanded network capacity  declining prices for equipment  increased consumer awareness and acceptance of wireless communications and pricing plans targeted at particular market segments 
additionally  average monthly revenue per digital unit increased from about for the year ended december  to about for the year ended december  the average churn rate for the digital mobile network operation increased from less than per month for the year ended december  to about per month for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the average monthly churn rate was about 
b 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased primarily resulting from an increase in cell sites activated in as well as an increase in airtime usage and an increase in digital subscriber units in service 
cost of revenues as a percentage of operating revenues have decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of economies of scale achieved due to the increase in digital subscriber units in service 
c 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased compared to  primarily as a result of increased staffing and other back office and customer care activities supporting the accelerated growth in nextel s implementation and operation of the digital mobile network 
selling expenses increased primarily due to increased sales and marketing labor costs and related commission expenses 
also contributing to the increase was the rollout of aggressive national and regional marketing campaigns to increase awareness of nextel s products and services associated with the full scale commercial launch of the digital mobile network incorporating the modified iden technology beginning in march nextel includes the loss generated from the sale of digital subscriber units in selling  general and administrative expenses  as the loss primarily represents marketing costs for the digital mobile network 
the loss on digital mobile subscriber equipment sales for the year ended december  increased by compared to  primarily reflecting the continued effect of customer subsidies and discounts on increased sales of digital subscriber units and other related digital subscriber equipment  and the expenses associated with programs designed to stimulate the orderly migration of customers from nextel s traditional analog smr systems to its new digital mobile network systems 
the loss on digital mobile subscriber equipment sales during also includes a million write down during for inventory shrinkage and obsolescence of subscriber unit inventory utilizing first generation iden technology 
d 
bad debt expense nextel recognized consolidated bad debt expense of about million for the year ended december  bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues  including both operating revenues and digital equipment revenues classified within selling and marketing expense  increased to in from in the amount of bad debt expense recognized by nextel during was significantly higher compared to as a result of a number of factors  including principally delays in the billing of amounts due on purchases of digital network subscriber equipment and the inability of nextel s billing and collection systems  processes and personnel to fully keep pace with the rapid growth of nextel s customer base and digital mobile network utilization 
as a result  nextel instituted a more comprehensive and aggressive program for the collection of past due receivables in the latter part of and increased its bad debt reserve  which contributed to the increased bad debt expense 
e 
depreciation and amortization effective october   nextel changed the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets including fcc licenses and the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired related to domestic acquisitions from to years to better reflect the period over which the economic benefits of such assets will be realized 
the change in the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets had the effect of decreasing amortization expense by about million for the quarter and the year ended december  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased  net of the effect of the change in useful lives of certain intangible assets  reflecting the effect of the activation of additional cell sites and switches  the expansion of the existing digital mobile network and the effect of certain asset and license acquisitions during system assets relating to the development of the digital mobile network represent the largest portion of capital expenditures during the year ended december  depreciation of such assets begins upon commencement of commercial service in the relevant markets 
f 
interest expense  interest income and other interest expense for the year ended december  increased compared to  reflecting higher debt balances primarily attributable to additional borrowings under nextel s secured credit facilities 
interest expense also increased during as a result of the issuance of discount notes by nextel and nextel international 
during the fourth quarter of  nextel purchased million book value of the notes and million book value of the notes at a cost in excess of related carrying amounts 
accordingly  nextel recorded an extraordinary loss of about million related to the early retirement of debt 
the extraordinary loss represented the difference between the purchase price and the book value of these notes on the date of purchase plus unamortized deferred financing costs 
interest income for the year ended december  increased  reflecting higher average cash balances available for investment during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of the capital raised from discount notes issued by nextel international and to a lesser extent  the proceeds received from the issuance of preferred stock and discount notes by nextel 
other income for the year ended december  was million  primarily reflecting a million gain on the disposal of assets  foreign currency transaction gains of million and million of net losses derived from foreign investments charged to minority shareholders offset by million of net losses of certain foreign investments accounted for under the equity method 
nextel recorded an income tax provision of million an effective tax rate of in  compared to a benefit of million an effective tax rate of in the results were unfavorably impacted as a result of an increase in nextel s valuation allowance related to net operating losses 
nextel recorded substantial deferred tax liabilities related to its fcc licenses  and as a result of the change in estimated useful lives  a large portion of such deferred tax liabilities will now reverse after current net operating losses expire 
after considering the effect of this change and other factors  such as recent operating results  nextel increased its valuation reserves  resulting in an income tax provision in versus a benefit in c 
liquidity and capital resources nextel had net losses attributable to common stockholders of  million for and  million for the operating expenses associated with developing  enhancing and operating the digital mobile network have more than offset operating revenues  and such operating expenses  debt service obligations and anticipated capital expenditures are expected to continue to offset such operating revenues for the next several years 
nextel has consistently used external sources of funds  primarily from equity issuances and debt incurrences  to fund operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other non operating needs 
for the next several years  nextel intends to use its existing cash and investments  anticipated positive earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and externally generated funds from debt and equity sources as discussed below to cover the majority of its future liquidity needs  including funding required for the design  implementation and operation of its digital mobile network 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities for decreased by million compared to the improvement in the cash used in operating activities reflects improved domestic operating results coupled with strengthened cost controls and cash management practices 
capital expenditures to fund the continued expansion of the digital mobile network continue to represent the largest use of company funds for investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for increased million as compared to  primarily attributable to the million increase in capital expenditures 
cash payments for capital expenditures totaled  million for net of million of gross proceeds received from a sale leaseback transaction involving switch equipment  and  million for  including million and million representing capital expenditures for international operations for and  respectively 
capital spending has increased as a result of the continued build out of the digital mobile network to enhance or expand coverage and increase network capacity 
also contributing to the increase in cash used in investing activities was a million increase in payments for acquisitions and purchases of licenses  including million and million in payments required in connection with the recently concluded fcc auctions for mhz and lmds licenses  respectively  and million of additional cash investments in international subsidiaries 
the increases in cash used in investing activities were offset in part by million in net proceeds from marketable securities transactions 
cash flows provided by financing activities for increased by million as compared to  primarily reflecting net proceeds in from the issuance of long term debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and additional borrowings under domestic and international credit facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities during consisted primarily of gross proceeds from the series e preferred of million  the february notes of  million  the november notes of million  the zero coupon preferred of million  and the ni notes of million along with  million in net borrowings under nextel s bank credit agreement and nextel international s bank and vendor credit facilities and million in proceeds from common stock issuances and option exercises offset in part by repurchases of the targeted notes in april of million and deferred financing cost payments of million 
during  working capital decreased by million to million at december  this decrease primarily resulted from the utilization of working capital derived from the proceeds of the discount notes issued by nextel international in to fund international investing and operating activities 
proceeds of the discount notes issued by nextel international in are primarily available to finance international operations  capital expenditures and acquisitions and are not available to fund any of the cash needs of nextel s domestic businesses due to restrictions contained in the related indentures 
nextel s construction and operation of its domestic digital mobile network have been and continue to be principally financed by incurring long term debt 
d 
future capital needs and resources nextel anticipates that  for the foreseeable future  it will be utilizing significant amounts of its available cash for capital expenditures for the construction and enhancement of the digital mobile network  operating expenses relating both to the digital mobile network and to its analog smr business  potential acquisitions including any negotiated acquisitions of spectrum from third parties and any future auctions of spectrum in auctions conducted by the fcc  debt service requirements  and other general corporate expenditures 
nextel anticipates that its cash utilization for capital expenditures and other investing activities will continue to exceed its positive cash flows from domestic operating activities throughout as it builds out  expands and enhances its digital mobile network 
the bank credit agreement  as amended  provides total potential secured financing capacity of billion  of which billion in secured financing is currently available to nextel  subject to the satisfaction or waiver of applicable borrowing conditions 
this facility consists of a billion revolving loan and billion in term loans which mature over a period from september  to march  at december   nextel had drawn billion of its available financing under the bank credit agreement 
amounts outstanding under the bank credit agreement are secured by liens on assets of certain of nextel s domestic subsidiaries and bear interest payable quarterly at an adjustable rate calculated based either on the prime rate or libor 
the maturity date of the loans is subject to acceleration if the aggregate principal amount of certain series of nextel s senior redeemable discount notes is not less than billion by specified dates 
the availability of such financing is subject to nextel s satisfying certain requirements under the indentures governing its public notes issued before  which require nextel to issue new equity for cash as a condition to obtaining access to all amounts not constituting permitted debt as that term is defined in the applicable indentures 
based on the amount of equity issuances  including issuances of preferred stock in and  and nextel s outstanding debt at december   nextel may access billion available under the bank credit agreement in compliance with the debt incurrence covenants contained in those indentures 
based on its preliminary assessment of business activity and related net cash needs through the end of  nextel anticipates that its cash on hand including proceeds of the november notes and zero coupon preferred  the remaining amounts available for borrowing under the bank credit agreement  the cash proceeds assumed to be received upon the exercise in of options held by the mccaw investor  the cash payment recently received upon completing the sale of assets to nextel partners  the cash proceeds assumed to be received upon closing of the currently pending towers sale transaction with spectrasite and the net cash expected to be generated by domestic operations through the end of  collectively  will provide sufficient funds to finance nextel s domestic operations  meet its domestic debt service obligations and fund its domestic capital expenditures  all at levels nextel currently anticipates would be consistent with maintaining growth within an assumed range of an annual rate of to million net domestic digital subscriber unit additions during access to additional funding would likely enhance nextel s growth prospects

liquidity and capital resources and part i  item business n 
risk factors nextel s forward looking statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current beliefs 
nextel may require substantial additional financing to fund further deployment  expansion and enhancement of its digital mobile network after nextel also may require additional financing to pursue activities related to new business opportunities including commercial activities involving its deployment of data transmission services  additional spectrum acquisitions including any negotiated acquisitions of spectrum from third parties and spectrum auctions by the fcc and other potential transactions or investments not a part of its current domestic mobile wireless communications businesses 
finally  the above funding requirements and estimates relate only to nextel s domestic business operations and opportunities  and do not reflect any of the separate funding needs of nextel international 
the availability of borrowings pursuant to the bank credit agreement is subject to certain conditions  and nextel cannot provide assurance that such conditions will be met 
moreover  nextel cannot provide assurances that it will receive funding from its other existing or assumed sources  such as the exercise of outstanding options to purchase nextel s common stock  or the closing of pending transactions that would provide additional cash proceeds 
the instruments relating to nextel s financing arrangements and preferred stock contain provisions that operate to limit the amount of borrowings that may be incurred by nextel 
the terms of the bank credit agreement also require nextel and its restricted subsidiaries at specified times to maintain compliance with certain operating and financial covenants or ratios  including certain covenants and ratios specifically related to leverage  which become more stringent over time 
in addition  nextel s capital needs  and its ability to adequately address those needs through debt or equity funding sources  are subject to a variety of factors that cannot presently be predicted with certainty  for example  the commercial success of nextel s digital mobile network  the amount and timing of nextel s capital expenditures and operating losses  the availability and volatility of the equity and debt markets  the market price of its common stock and consummation of specific pending transactions 
see part i  item business n 
risk factors nextel s forward looking statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current beliefs 
nextel has had and may in the future have discussions with third parties regarding potential equity investments and debt financing arrangements to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs 
at present  other than the existing equity or debt financing arrangements that have been consummated and or are disclosed herein  nextel has no legally binding commitments or understandings with any third parties to obtain any material amount of equity or debt financing 
under the terms of the agreements between nextel and motorola pursuant to which nextel acquired substantially all of motorola s domestic mhz specialized mobile radio licenses in  nextel has agreed  under certain circumstances  not to grant superior governance rights to any third party investor without motorola s consent which may make securing equity investments more difficult 
the ability of nextel to incur additional indebtedness including  in certain circumstances  indebtedness incurred under the bank credit agreement is and will be limited by the terms of the indentures relating to nextel s senior notes  the terms of some of nextel s preferred stock and the bank credit agreement 
e 
nextel international capital needs to fund its currently planned network build out requirements and operations  nextel international will require a significant amount of capital 
based on nextel international s assessment of the business activity and related cash needs of the international operating companies that are controlled by or that rely substantially on nextel international for further funding  nextel international believes that it will have adequate funding to continue operations only into the latter half of nextel international is reviewing various financing options  including private debt or equity financing  that if obtained would provide nextel international with sufficient funds to meet such funding requirements for the remainder of fiscal year there can be no assurance that nextel international will obtain any such funds on satisfactory terms  if at all  or that such funds  if obtained  would be sufficient to meet nextel international s funding requirements for the remainder of fiscal year consistent with its current plans 
if nextel international is unable to raise additional funds or obtain funds on acceptable terms and in a timely manner  nextel international will be required to reduce the scope of the build out  expansion and enhancement of its digital network and curtail its operations significantly in  which could have a material adverse effect on nextel international s ability to compete and its financial condition and results of operations

effect of inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation is not a material factor affecting nextel s business 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and lease costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
from time to time nextel may experience price changes in connection with the purchase of certain system infrastructure and subscriber equipment  but nextel does not currently believe that any of such price changes will be material to its business 
the net assets of the international operating companies are subject to foreign currency exchange risks since they are primarily maintained in local currency 
additionally  the long term debt of nextel international and its subsidiaries is almost entirely in us dollar denominated form  which also exposes such entities to local foreign exchange risks 
certain subsidiaries conduct business in countries in which the rate of inflation is significantly higher than that of the united states 
nextel international will attempt to protect its earnings from inflation and possible currency devaluation by trying to periodically adjust the relevant subsidiaries prices in local currencies  and in some cases setting such prices in direct relation to the us dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that any significant devaluation of a foreign currency against the us dollar could be offset  in whole or in part  by a corresponding price increase 
while nextel international routinely assesses its foreign currency exposure  nextel international has not entered into any hedging transactions 
as a result of the recent devaluation in the brazilian real  nextel international will record for the quarter ended march   a pre tax charge net of minority interest of about million for foreign currency transaction losses 
this amount has been calculated based on the outstanding amount of us dollar denominated debt of nextel international s brazilian subsidiaries  the average exchange rate of the brazilian real during the first quarter of and nextel international s percentage ownership interest in its brazilian subsidiaries at the end of such period 
additionally  nextel international will record a negative cumulative translation adjustment on its balance sheet determined in a manner consistent with prior periods of about million based on the exchange rate as of february  in accordance with nextel international s consolidation policy  which will be reflected as an adjustment to the cumulative translation adjustment account within stockholders equity 
the countries in which nextel international s subsidiaries now conduct business generally do not restrict the repatriation or conversion of local or foreign currency 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be the case in each market that nextel international may enter in the future or that this situation will continue in nextel international s existing markets 
nextel international s subsidiaries are all directly affected by their respective countries governmental  economic  fiscal and monetary policies and other political factors

year readiness as is the case with most other businesses using computers in their operations  nextel is in the process of evaluating and addressing year readiness of its computer systems 
such year readiness efforts are designed to identify  address and resolve issues that may be created by computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of nextel s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations that result in disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
state of readiness nextel has had a program in place since february to address year readiness issues in its critical business areas related to products  networks  information management systems  non information systems with embedded technology  suppliers and customers 
nextel has taken and will continue to take actions designed to advance its progress toward becoming year ready by the end of the third quarter of nextel s year readiness goal focuses on the ability of nextel to perform its business functions and to process information in an unambiguous manner under various date conditions 
however  nextel s ability to reach its year readiness goal depends and will continue to depend on the efforts of significant third party vendors  suppliers  subcontractors and business partners 
some of these significant third parties are not yet year ready  while others have provided nextel with detailed action plans and timetables for achieving year readiness 
nextel monitors the progress of these third parties towards year readiness on a regular basis 
nextel regularly contacts and attempts to obtain from these third parties relevant details and schedules concerning their contemplated development of year ready applications for nextel s utilization in its domestic and international operations and systems 
specifically  nextel relies on services and products offered by the following significant third parties motorola  for nextel s system infrastructure and subscriber handset units  international telecommunications data systems  inc  as the software vendor for nextel s domestic order entry and provisioning systems  as well as nextel s domestic billing information systems  lhs group  inc as the software vendor for nextel international s billing information systems  vantive corporation  which provides information systems used in nextel s customer care function and provides order entry systems for nextel international  oracle corporation  which provides nextel with information systems  development tools and database management used to support its human resources function and financial systems  and hewlett packard  inc  which supplies computer hardware  for example  monitors and peripherals  and unix operating systems 
nextel has identified five phases that assist in defining the status of progress toward year readiness 
the five phases are awareness locating  listing and prioritizing specific technology used in nextel s operations that is potentially subject to year readiness related challenges  assessment determining the level of risk of year readiness challenges that exist on nextel s systems through inquiry  research and testing  renovation determining and resolving year readiness related challenges identified in previous phases through replacement  upgrade or repair and planning for the scheduled implementation of the selected year ready resolution  validation testing  monitoring  certification and verification of the correct manipulation of dates and date related data on information technology it and non it systems  including those of material third parties  and implementation installing and integrating the application of year ready resolutions by replacement  upgrade or repair of non it and it systems  including those of material third parties 
as of march   with respect to its non it devices and or systems containing embedded circuitry  nextel is  primarily  in the assessment phase 
additionally  with respect to its it systems that are critical to nextel s business operations and issues relating to material third parties  nextel is in various phases noted as follows international telecommunications data systems  inc  informed nextel that software that operates nextel s domestic order entry and provisioning system has successfully completed the renovation phase and is scheduled for delivery to nextel for user acceptance testing and implementation 
this vendor has also informed nextel that the software used for domestic billing capabilities has successfully completed the assessment and renovation phases and is currently in unit and system integration testing phases  motorola informed nextel that the subscriber unit models i and i are year ready  and all other subscriber units are year ready with the exception of the short message service feature 
with regard to the digital mobile network  motorola has indicated that the following system infrastructure components are year ready critical call and data processing systems applicable to a significant portion of the digital mobile network have passed year readiness testing  nortel switches and cisco routers have passed year readiness testing appropriate for nextel s use  and voice mail system components have passed year readiness testing 
oracle provided information to nextel that the software that supports nextel s human resources function and financial systems is year ready in conjunction with recommended upgrades 
nextel is in the process of establishing the environment to test and apply these upgrades  vantive provided information to nextel that it has tested and certified the year readiness of the software that will be used to develop year ready customer care systems for nextel international s operations  lhs informed nextel that the software currently in use in nextel international s systems that support the billing processes is year ready in conjunction with recommended upgrades 
nextel international is currently conducting in house year readiness testing and its implementation plans include making the appropriate upgrades recommended by lhs  and motorola communications israel ltd  which provides the provisioning systems for nextel international  certified that its software is year ready 
to ensure the continued progress and success in managing all of nextel s systems year readiness requirements  a special steering committee that includes members of senior management responsible for nextel s information technology and network systems was formed to oversee this effort 
internal employees  as well as outside contractors  staff nextel s year readiness program 
members include employees across functional and divisional departments who are responsible for assisting in the identification  assessment and remediation of year readiness challenges 
in addition  the representatives from some of the material third parties identified above participate in this project 
the costs to address nextel s year readiness challenges based on information developed to date  as a result of nextel s assessment efforts  nextel believes that the costs of modifying  upgrading or replacing its systems and equipment will not have a material effect on nextel s liquidity  its financial condition or results of operations 
although nextel s budget for year readiness efforts has not yet been finalized  nextel currently estimates that its domestic and international expenditures in connection with these efforts will not exceed million 
to date  nextel has not deferred any specific projects  goals or objectives relating to its domestic and international operations as a result of implementing its year readiness efforts 
the risks of nextel s year readiness challenges in light of the progress made to date  nextel does not anticipate delays or postponements in finalizing and implementing year readiness solutions by the end of the third quarter of until nextel s renovation and validation phases are substantially complete  however  nextel cannot fully and accurately estimate any uncertainty in timely resolving its year readiness challenges or in finalizing and implementing related year readiness resolutions 
additionally  any failure by third parties which have a material relationship with nextel to achieve full year readiness may be a potential risk if such failure were to adversely impact the ability of such third parties to provide any products or services that are critical to nextel s operations 
finally  where nextel cannot validate or certify that technology provided by material third parties is fully year ready  nextel is seeking to obtain assurances from these material third parties that their systems are or will be year ready no later than the end of the third quarter of if these material third parties fail to appropriately address their own year readiness challenges  there could be a materially adverse effect on nextel s financial condition and results of operations 
these risks include  but are not limited to inability of subscribers to make or receive phone calls  inability of sites  switches and other interfaces to accurately record call details of subscriber phone calls  and inability of billing systems to accurately report and bill subscribers for phone usage 
other risks associated with the inability of nextel or material third parties to develop and deploy year ready solutions in a timely and successful manner may involve or result in conditions that could preclude nextel from deploying an alternative technology that is year ready  implementing commercial launches in new markets or introducing new services in existing markets  pursuing additional business opportunities  and obtaining equity or debt financing 
significantly  nextel cannot independently assess the impact of year readiness challenges  activities and programs involving operators of public switched telecommunications networks or other service providers  for example  electric utilities 
nextel therefore must rely on public switched telecommunications networks and utility providers estimates of their own year readiness challenges and the status of their related compliance activities and programs in nextel s own year readiness assessment process 
because nextel s systems will be interconnected with public switched telecommunications networks and will be dependent upon the systems of other service providers  any disruption of operations in the computer programs of such public switched telecommunications networks or service providers would likely have an impact on nextel s systems 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such impact will not have a materially adverse effect on nextel s operations 
finally  in assessing its year readiness exposure associated with its international operations  nextel has considered that certain operators of public switched telecommunications networks or other service providers and operations located in foreign countries may not be at the same level of awareness or assessment of the year readiness challenges and remedial measures as their united states counterparts 
these factors  to the extent present with respect to nextel s international operations  may result in delays in identifying year readiness challenges and a lag in implementing remediation efforts as compared with nextel s domestic operations 
in the event nextel s international affiliates and their own material third parties fail to timely address their year readiness challenges  nextel s international operations could experience disruption after december  nextel s contingency plans nextel has not completed all systems and software testing in its critical systems  nor has it been advised of the completion of such activities by all third party providers of critical products and services 
as a result  nextel has not fully assessed its exposure from potential year nonreadiness 
nextel is preparing guidelines for addressing year readiness contingency plans for external and internal systems should it be determined that contingency plans are necessary 
following testing of nextel s critical systems  nextel will evaluate and possibly create alternative plans designed to address various potential business interruptions that may occur as a result of non readiness 
additionally  since contingency plans may also be provided by third parties  nextel will assess the development of appropriate alternative solutions presented by any relevant third party to determine its effectiveness and likely impact on nextel s year readiness risk profile
