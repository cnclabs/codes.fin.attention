the company believes that sales per square foot is a useful measure of comparing the company s performance to that of its competitors because it is a measure of a store s sales productivity 
the company currently expects that its sales per square foot may decline as it continues with its plan to increase new store openings during the opening of such additional stores may result in a decline in sales per square foot principally because i the average square footage for new stores will often be greater than that of the existing store base and ii new stores generally take some time to reach a mature level of sales

the principal components of the refinancing plan were i the sale by the company of million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million  ii the execution of a new secured credit agreement the existing credit agreement  which provided for borrowings up to approximately million million of term loans and up to million of revolving loans  iii the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of the company s senior subordinated notes due the senior notes for net proceeds of approximately million  iv the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the company s former credit agreement  the outstanding principal amount of which was million as of december   v the redemption of the company s outstanding zero coupon notes  vi the redemption of the company s outstanding senior notes due on august   in connection with the rock bottom acquisition  the existing credit agreement was amended to allow for increased term loan borrowings of million 
on september   also in connection with the rock bottom acquisition  the existing credit agreement was amended and restated to increase available term loan borrowings by million  bringing the total permitted borrowings under the existing credit agreement to million of term loans and up to million of revolving loans 
working capital was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the increase is primarily due to increases in inventory related to the rock bottom acquisition  the opening of additional stores during and the company s increase in its investments in forward buy inventory 
in addition  accounts receivable increased due to additional volume as well as an increase in third party pharmacy receivables due to the company s decision to no longer factor these receivables 
the company s ebitda increased by million or to million in compared to ebitda as a percentage of sales increased to in from in for the fiscal year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  the primary reason for this use of cash was an increase in inventory and vendor receivables previously discussed 
the company believes that the activities have not and will not materially adversely affect its liquidity 
for the fiscal year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase reflects the rock bottom acquisition and capital expenditures in related to store openings and remodeling 
for the fiscal year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from proceeds from the offering  new term loan financing  proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes  the borrowing of million to finance the rock bottom acquisition and related supporting inventory  and the revolving credit facility borrowing  net of repayments for capital lease obligations 
during the third quarter  the company completed the transfer of its warehouse operations to the distribution center in maspeth  new york 
this new facility  which has doubled the company s distribution capacity  is located one mile away from the company s former center 
the company s capital requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores and from the continuing development of management information systems 
the company believes that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores  and currently plans to open approximately to stores during the next two years 
the company expects to spend approximately million in on capital expenditures primarily for new and replacement stores 
working capital is also required to support inventory for the company s existing stores 
historically  the company has been able to lease its store locations 
leases for seven of the company s stores that generated approximately of the company s net sales for the fiscal year ended december  are scheduled to expire before the end of the year the company believes that it will be able to renew such leases on economically favorable terms or  alternatively  find other economically attractive locations to lease 
as of december   approximately  of the company s approximately  employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
pursuant to the terms of such collectively bargaining agreements  the company is required to pay certain annual increases in salary and benefits to such employees 
the company does not believe that such increases will have a material impact on the company s liquidity or results of operations 
the company records significant accounts receivable related to pharmacy sales in connection with third party plans 
in the past  the company had a non recourse factoring arrangement with an independent third party  pharmacy fund  inc pharmacy fund under which the company sold it accounts receivable associated with the third party plans 
on september   pharmacy fund declared bankruptcy and no longer purchases the company s third party plan receivables 
the company believes that it will not suffer any loss from the bankruptcy 
the company plans to collect its own receivables for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including borrowings under the existing credit agreement  will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of principal and interest on the company s indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the terms of its debt agreements 
as of december   the company had borrowed approximately million under the revolving portion of its bank credit facility and had approximately million of remaining availability 
the ability of the company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the future performance of the company and its subsidiaries which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of its indebtedness in the future 
substantially all of the company s borrowings under the existing credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  therefore  the company s financial condition will be affected by the changes in prevailing interest rates 
the company has entered into interest rate protection agreements to minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates 
tax benefits from net operating losses at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million  which are due to expire in the years through these nols may be used to offset future taxable income through and thereby reduce or eliminate the company s federal income taxes otherwise payable 
the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  imposes significant limitations on the utilization of nols in the event of an ownership change  as defined in section of the code the section limitation 
the section limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre ownership change nols that a corporation may use to offset its post ownership change income 
the section limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporation s stock immediately before an ownership change by the long term tax exempt rate as published by the internal revenue service 
generally  an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership by value of that corporation by one or more shareholders including certain groups of shareholders who in the aggregate own at least of that corporation s stock exceeds percentage points over a three year testing period 
the recapitalization caused the company to experience an ownership change 
as a result  the company currently is subject to an annual section limitation of approximately million on the amount of nols generated prior to the recapitalization that the company may utilize to offset future taxable income 
nols generated by the company since the recapitalization approximately million are not subject to the section limitation and may be used to offset future taxable income 
there can be no assurance that any nols will be able to be used by the company to offset future taxable income or that such nols will not become subject to limitation due to future ownership changes 
year update the company is implementing a program to ensure that the company computer systems and applications it systems and non it systems will function properly beyond this program includes inventorying year items  assigning priorities to the identified items  assessing year compliance of items determined to be material to the company  remediating or preplacing material items that are not year compliant  and determining contingency plans that may be required 
the company has completed inventorying and prioritizing year compliance of its it systems and is commencing these phases for its non it systems  which will include surveying significant third party vendors 
the company is upgrading its software and expects this phase to be completed by june  the company is using both internal and external resources to address year issues and believes that the cost of such modifications will approximate  approximately  of this includes system upgrades that had been previously identified for operational enhancements 
although management expects to complete the upgrading of all of its software by mid  the company will develop a year contingency plan before mid if it appears that the company will not achieve full year compliance 
management regularly monitors the status of the year compliance process 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
no assurances  however  can be given that the company will be able to identify and address all year issues due to their complexity as well as the company s dependence on the technical skills of employees and independent contractors and on the representations and preparedness of third parties with which the company does business 
although the company believes that its efforts are designed to appropriately identify and address year issues that are subject to the company s reasonable control  there can be no assurance that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
seasonality in general  sales of drugstores items such as prescription drugs  otc drugs and health and beauty care products exhibit limited seasonality in the aggregate  but do vary by product category 
quarterly results are primarily affected by the timing of new store openings and the sale of seasonal products 
in view of the company s recent expansion of seasonal merchandising  the company expects slightly greater revenue sensitivity relating to seasonality in the future 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on results of operations for the company during the three years ended december  recently issued accounting pronouncements fasb statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that derivative instruments such as options  forward contracts and swaps be recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and provides guidance for recognition of changes in fair value depending on the reason for holding the derivative 
the company does not presently have significant transactions involving derivative instruments  but may do so in the future 
the company is required to adopt statement no 
for the first quarter of and may adopt it earlier 
item a 
market risk the financial results of the company are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates 
variable rate debt outstanding under the existing credit agreement was approximately million at december   which is somewhat lower than the company expects its outstanding variable rate debt to be during the next twelve months 
the anticipated outstanding balances  however  are not expected to be materially greater than at december  based on the december  outstanding balances  a change in interest rates would affect annual results of operations by approximately million 
the company also has million of senior notes outstanding at december  these notes  which bear interest at a fixed  are not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations 
the principal objective of the company s investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate the funding needs of the company 
as part of its investment management  the company may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps 
during the year ended december  there were no derivative positions 
during the year ended december   in connection with the existing credit agreement requirements  the company entered into an interest rate protection agreement
