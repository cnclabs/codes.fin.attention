item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors which affect our financial performance in the last three fiscal years  our financial performance has been affected by several major factors 
lead 
lead is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of batteries  representing approximately one third of our cost of goods sold 
the market price of lead fluctuates significantly 
generally  when lead prices decrease  many of our customers seek disproportionate price reductions from us  and when lead prices increase  customers tend to be more accepting of price increases 
lead market prices declined substantially over the last three fiscal years 
competition 
the automotive battery market in north america and the automotive and industrial battery markets in europe are highly competitive 
in recent years  competition has increased and we have come under increasing pressure for price reductions 
price competition in europe has been particularly intense 
this price competition has been exacerbated by an environment of low priced asian imports  excess capacity and declining lead prices 
prices are continuing to decline in europe  but at a slower rate  due in part to improvements in the asian economies and recent lead price increases 
exchange rates 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk in most european countries  principally germany  france  united kingdom  spain  and italy 
movements of exchange rates against the us dollar can result in variations in the us dollar value of our non us sales 
in some instances gains in one currency may be offset by losses in another 
our results for fiscal and were adversely impacted by weakness in all european currencies except the pound sterling 
weather 
unusually cold winters or hot summers accelerate battery failure and increase demand for automotive replacement batteries 
during the periods discussed below  unusually warm winters resulted in fewer automotive battery failures in north america and europe and this adversely affected our aftermarket sales 
sears 
sears  whom we began supplying in fiscal  accounted for a significant portion of our north american aftermarket sales approximately million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our aggressive pricing to obtain the sears business resulted in prices to them about one third less than our average sales prices on other north american aftermarket sales 
in addition  our selling and distribution costs were greater for sears than our other major customers 
after extensive discussions in fiscal  we terminated our supply relationship with sears 
acquisition of deta 
we purchased deta  a german battery manufacturer  in september for approximately million  plus approximately million of assumed debt 
accordingly  deta s results of operations were included for seven months of fiscal and all of fiscal deta s sales in fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal write downs of non core and excess assets 
in fiscal  our earnings were reduced by million as a result of charges for certain non core assets which we decided to sell and the closure of certain facilities 
results of operations year ended march  compared with year ended march  net sales 
net sales increased million or to  million as compared to  million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the following factors 
the inclusion of deta a german industrial and automotive battery manufacturer acquired on september  for months of fiscal versus months of fiscal million 

higher automotive battery volumes in north america of million offset by higher sales deductions of million 
along with a full year of deta sales  european sales were also favorably impacted by exchange rates million and slightly higher automotive unit volume 
these increases were partially offset by unfavorable automotive battery pricing mix in europe million  lower industrial sales excluding the full year effect of deta of million and a reduction in other european sales million 
industrial battery sales included above for fiscal were million for fiscal versus million in gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal decreased million or to million 
the decrease in gross profit is largely a result of the items discussed above and the following 
a million charge related to write downs associated with exiting non core business activities and the closure of certain facilities  
a million loss on lead hedging contracts in north america  
a million charge for an adverse appellate court ruling in a patent infringement lawsuit  
a million charge for the write off of inventory and equipment related to an abandoned project and 
a million charge for the write off of unsaleable inventory specified for the russian market 
these decreases were partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs  particularly in europe  along with the impact of sales volume increases mentioned above and a greater emphasis on sales of higher profit margin batteries 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million 
the impact of including deta for months in fiscal versus only months in fiscal resulted in approximately million of the increase 
also contributing to this increase was 
charges of million related to specific legal expenses  including settlement of the florida attorney general investigation 

a million charge for increased bad debt reserves primarily related to north american customers who have filed for bankruptcy  
a million charge related to separation packages of executives and additional retirement charges  
a million charge for uncollectable receivables from sales in russia  
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates million and 
a million charge relating to write downs associated with existing non core buisness activities 
goodwill amortization increased million or to million from million in  resulting primarily from the write off of goodwill associated with the closure of a smelter operation and the write off of impaired goodwill from certain branch acquisitions of million 
operating income 
operating income decreased million as a result of the matters discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million or to million versus million in as a result of lower rates achieved through debt restructuring completed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income expense  net in was million versus million in for a change of million 
contributing to this change was 
currency transaction losses in of million versus currency transaction gains of million in  
a million charge in recorded for an amendment fee related to interest rate swap agreements and 
additionally  fiscal included a million gain from an involuntary conversion due to a fire 
income tax provision 
income tax expense increased million to million despite the million reduction in pre tax earnings 
this increase relates principally to the company s inability to further tax benefit its us and certain european tax losses 
net income loss 
the net loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the matters discussed above offset by a million reduction in its extraordinary loss relating to the early retirement of debt 
year ended march  compared with year ended march  net sales 
net sales decreased million to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal the decrease was principally attributable to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates million and the fiscal divestiture of evanite million offset by the fiscal acquisition of deta million 
industrial battery sales included above for fiscal year were versus million in fiscal gross profit 
although sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  gross profit increased million in fiscal versus the gross profit margin was in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase in gross profit is largely the result of 
the acquisition of deta in fiscal million  
manufacturing cost reductions related to the continuing european rationalization consolidation process and 
the favorable effects of certain environmental developments during fiscal these favorable items were offset in part by the effects of weaker european currencies million and the fiscal divestiture of evanite which contributed million of gross profit in fiscal the gross profit was also favorably affected by the higher gross margins of the deta acquisition and product mix  including the higher margin exide nascar select products 
selling  marketing and advertising expenses 
selling  marketing and advertising expenses increased million or largely due to the acquisition of deta million  higher us advertising costs for the launch of the exide nascar select line of products and higher provisions million for accounts receivable losses primarily as a result of the bankruptcy filings by certain major us retailers mostly during the fourth fiscal quarter 
offsetting these increases were the effects of weaker currencies million  the evanite divestiture million and savings from headcount reductions in europe resulting from the rationalization consolidation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal versus due to the effects of weaker currencies million  the evanite divestiture million and savings from headcount reductions in europe resulting from rationalization consolidation offset by the increase due to deta million 
goodwill amortization decreased slightly as a result of the weakening of european currencies offset by the increased amortization resulting from the deta acquisition 
operating income 
operating income decreased million  or  as a result of the matters discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  primarily due to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates million and to the lower rates related to the refinancing of debt in fiscal  offset by the increased expense for the borrowing related to the acquisition of deta 
other income 
other income  net was million for fiscal versus million for fiscal the million decrease principally relates to the fiscal gain on sale of evanite million and increased losses on the sales of accounts receivable and associated fees in europe in fiscal million 
offsetting this decrease was a gain from an involuntary conversion due to a fire in fiscal million 
net income 
net income decreased million to a loss of million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million extraordinary loss net of income tax benefit of million related to the early retirement of debt 
seasonality and weather we sell most of our automotive batteries during the fall and early winter our second and third fiscal quarters 
retailers buy automotive batteries during these periods so they will have enough inventory when cold weather strikes 
in addition  many of our industrial battery customers in europe do not place their battery orders until the end of the calendar year 
the seasonality of our business increases our working capital requirements 
demand for automotive batteries is significantly affected by the weather 
unusually cold winters or hot summers accelerate battery failure and increase demand for automotive replacement batteries 
mild winters and cool summers have the opposite effect 
as a result  if our sales are reduced by an unusually warm winter or cool summer  it is not possible for us to recover these sales in later periods 
further  if our sales are adversely affected by the weather  we cannot make offsetting cost reductions to protect our gross margins because a large portion of our manufacturing and distribution costs are fixed 
we have a number of products  such as marine batteries and lawn and garden tractor batteries that tend to offset this seasonality somewhat 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of seasonal working capital needs  obligations on our indebtedness and capital expenditures 
historically  we have met these liquidity requirements through operating cash flows  borrowed funds and the proceeds of sales of accounts receivable and sale leaseback transactions 
we have a us receivables purchase agreement and a european receivables purchase agreement under which the other parties have committed subject to certain exceptions to purchase selected accounts receivable from us  up to a maximum commitment of million and million  respectively 
our greatest cash demands from operations occur during the months of june through october 
we believe we will be able to meet our requirements for liquidity with cash generated from operations  reduced working capital requirements  borrowings under the revolving credit portion of our credit agreement and the proceeds from sales of accounts receivable under our securitization facilities and or sales of non core assets 
our cash flow from operating activities was million  million including million of receivables sales and million including million of receivables sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
because of the seasonality of our business  more cash is typically generated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters than the first and second quarters 
in the next several years  we will evaluate the cost and benefit of closing additional plants in europe which would necessitate cash payments for severance and other closure costs 
we are reviewing all aspects of our operations and are planning to divest certain other non core operations in order to generate cash 
exide s capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the credit agreement restricts the amount of capital expenditures which we can make  but we believe that such restrictions will not adversely effect our capital expenditure programs 
as of march   we had million outstanding and million available under our credit agreement after consideration of million of outstanding letters of credit 
increases in interest rates on such obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the credit agreement is fully secured by guarantees of our european subsidiaries and by most of our fixed assets  inventory and receivables 
we have an interest rate collar agreement which reduces the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of our floating rate debt 
the collar agreement effectively limits the pibor paris interbank offered rate base interest rate on million french francs us million of borrowings to no more than and no less than through december  we have two currency and interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert million of borrowings under the credit agreement into million french francs us million and million british pounds sterling us million 
we receive libor london interbank offered rate and pay pibor and pounds sterling libor 
the company has an investment in a european joint venture 
the other party to the transaction has the right to require the company to purchase its interest in the joint venture at any time after september  for a defined multiple of earnings of the joint venture 
as of march   we have significant net operating loss carryforwards in europe and in the united states which are available  subject to certain restrictions  to offset future us and certain european countries taxable income 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the company s net deferred tax assets include certain amounts of net operating loss carryforwards principally in the us  which management believes are realizable through a combination of anticipated tax planning strategies and forecasted future taxable income 
in fiscal and fiscal  the company implemented certain tax planning strategies which utilized a portion of such deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted future taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of any remaining recorded net deferred tax assets 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our operations during the past three years 
we generally have been able to offset the effects of inflation with price increases  cost reduction programs and operating efficiencies 
future environmental developments we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
future environmental  health and safety standards may be more stringent 
we anticipate that such potential standards could cause an increase in our capital expenditures and operating costs 
unless and until the standards are adopted it is not possible to estimate these costs with any certainty or to predict whether they will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
see business environment  health and safety matters 
year issue we rely on information technology systems hardware  operating systems  software applications to support many key operations of our business  including sales order processing  production scheduling  purchasing  distribution  financial accounting  and others 
we have conducted initial assessments of all systems and have determined that many were not year compliant 
we believe all of these systems must be made compliant to ensure no material business interruption 
to date  the majority of our information technology systems have been made compliant 
additionally  our year plans include the assessment and related remediation of any non information technology systems that may incorporate embedded computer chip technology 
some of our manufacturing equipment contains such technology 
we have identified the systems equipment that need remediation  as well as the actions  resources needed  and the time frames to perform the remediation 
compliance assessments are ongoing and we make modifications to individual project plans as needed 
we are monitoring our overall remediation status on a regular basis  including periodic reporting to our audit committee 
we have made significant progress in our year remediation efforts 
costs for north american year remediation are approximately million  of which million has been expended to date 
we expect to achieve year compliance in europe for information technology and non information technology systems by september  the estimated costs for our european year remediation efforts is approximately million of which million has been expended to date 
in addition to our own year compliance  we believe that our business could potentially be adversely impacted if our key suppliers do not achieve timely and successful year compliance with their systems and equipment 
we have been in contact with our key business partners regarding their year readiness 
our vertically integrated structure  particularly in north america and to a lesser extent in europe  might mitigate the adverse impact of third parties year issues on us 
we are implementing our year program in the following seven phases  some of which have been completed  while others are being conducted concurrently inventory 
this phase involved the identification and validation of an inventory of all systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the inventory phase has been completed 
assessment 
this phase involved the initial testing and code scanning to determine whether remediation is needed and to develop a remediation plan  if applicable 
the assessment of business information systems for both north america and europe was completed by april the assessment of infrastructure items and embedded systems was substantially completed by june for north america and by december for europe 
remediation 
this phase involves the design and execution of a remediation plan 
we have substantially completed the remediation of our critical systems and are on track to meet our remediation targets 
system test 
this phase involves the testing of remediation items to ensure that they function normally after being returned to their original operating environment 
it is closely related to the remediation phase and follows essentially the same schedule 
implementation 
this phase involves the return of items to normal operation after satisfactory performance in system testing 
it follows essentially the same schedule as remediation and system testing 
readiness testing 
this phase involves the planning for and testing of integrated systems in a year ready environment  including ongoing auditing and follow up 
this phase commenced in the second quarter of and is expected to be a major focus of the year program throughout contingency planning 
this phase involves the development and execution of plans that narrow the focus on specific areas of significant concern and concentrate resources to address them 
we currently believe that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that there will be some localized disruptions of systems that will affect individual business processes  facilities or suppliers for a short time rather than systemic or long term problems affecting our business operation as a whole 
our contingency planning will continue to review systems and other aspects of our business throughout because there is uncertainty as to which activities may be affected and the exact nature of the problems that may arise  our contingency planning will focus on minimizing the scope and duration of any disruptions by having sufficient personnel and other resources in place to permit a flexible  real time response to specific problems as they may arise at individual locations around the world 
specific contingency plans and resources for permitting the necessary flexibility of response have been identified and are being put into place 
the cost of our year program is being expensed as incurred with the exception of capitalizable replacement hardware 
total year remediation spending is estimated at approximately million of which million has been incurred as of march  and is not expected to be material to our operation  liquidity or capital resources 
we do not currently anticipate that we will experience a significant disruption of our business as a result of the year issue 
however  there is still uncertainty about the broader scope of the year issue as it may affect exide and third parties  including our customers  that are critical to our operations 
for example  lack of readiness by electrical and water utilities  financial institutions  governmental agencies or other providers of general infrastructure could  in some geographic areas  pose significant impediments to our ability to carry on our normal operations in the area or areas so affected 
in the event that we are unable to complete our remedial actions as described above and are unable to implement adequate contingency plans in the event that problems are encountered  there could be a material adverse effect on our business 
conversion to the euro currency on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and a common currency  the euro 
we conduct significant business in these member countries 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro is between january  and june  we are addressing the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
the more important issues facing us include 
converting information technology systems  
reassessing currency risk  
negotiating and amending contracts  and 
processing tax and accounting records 
based upon progress to date  we believe that use of the euro has not and will not have a significant impact on the manner in which we conduct our business affairs and process our business and accounting records 
accordingly  conversion to the euro has not and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks we are exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices and interest rates 
in order to manage these risks  we participate in a risk management program  which includes entering into a variety of foreign exchange and commodity forward contracts and options 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is provided in notes and to the financial statements 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor foreign exchange  commodity and interest rate risks  and related hedge positions 
positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk models 
the following analyses are based on sensitivity analysis tests which assume instantaneous  parallel shift in exchange rates and commodity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of sensitivity shifts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposures related to buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
more specifically  we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to uncertainty to which future earnings or assets and liability values are exposed due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies 
currently  our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to france  italy  united kingdom  spain and germany 
as of march   the net fair value asset of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was about million 
the potential loss in fair value liability for such financial instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be about million 
the model assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates  however  exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates 
commodity price risk we enter into commodity forward and option contracts 
such contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various metals used in the manufacturing of our lead acid batteries 
the net fair value liability of such contracts  excluding the underlying exposures  as of march  was about million 
the potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts  assuming a change in underlying commodity price  would be about million at march  this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
interest rate risk we have historically entered into interest rate swaps and other interest sensitive forward and option contracts 
such contracts are executed to offset our exposure to interest rate risk on our debt 
certain hedging activities on may   we entered into an interest rate bond swap agreement for million principal amount of our senior notes 
under the agreement  we paid libor plus to a counterparty and received from the counterparty the fixed coupon rate payments we made 
at the end of the agreement  the counterparty was guaranteed repayment of its open market purchase price of the notes  which exceeded face value by  this debt modification was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt  and the related write off of unamortized deferred financing costs  along with the premium paid by the counterparty  resulted in an extraordinary loss of  in october  we paid an amendment fee of million to the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreements related to million of our senior notes due this fee was recorded as other expense in the third fiscal quarter of in november  we terminated the million interest rate swap agreements 
in connection with such termination  we made a cash payment of million  of which million was recorded as a bond discount 
in january  we amended certain provisions effective december  of our existing credit agreement 
after consideration of the amendments  we were in compliance with all covenants 
as of march   the net fair value of the foreign currency and interest rate protection agreements was million 
these agreements effectively converted million of debt into million french francs us million and million pounds sterling us million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires recognition of all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities in consolidated balance sheets at fair value and determines the method s of gain loss recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
with our fiscal year ending march  and are currently assessing the effect that it may have on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
provides that  if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as 
a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  
a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction a cash flow hedge  or 
a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction a foreign currency hedge 
under sfas no 
 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on its intended use and designation 
for a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item 
for a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
for a foreign currency hedge  the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment 
for all other items not designated as hedging instruments  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change
