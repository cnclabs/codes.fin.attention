item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  manufactures  markets and sells photovoltaic pv solar cells  modules  and panels for generating solar electric power 
solar cells are semiconductor devices which convert sunlight directly into electricity 
solar electric power is used off the electric utility grid for many applications in the communications and transportation industries and in remote villages and homes 
solar electric power is also used in on grid applications by existing electric utility customers to provide a clean  renewable source of alternative or supplementary electric power 
the company was founded in as a successor to a business that was organized in to develop thin crystalline silicon photovoltaic and related optoelectronic technology 
initial revenue came from contract research performed primarily for the united states government 
the company commenced commercial solar cell manufacturing operations in with wafers purchased from third parties 
since then the commercial portion of the business has grown steadily  accounting for of total revenue for the year ended december  the company has received significant assistance in its transition from primarily a contract research organization to a commercial manufacturer of solar cells and modules 
such assistance originated from the us department of energy in the form of cost sharing contracts designed to assist the company in expanding its manufacturing capabilities and in reducing its manufacturing costs 
the company currently generates product revenues from the sale of solar cells  modules and panels 
although the company s future plans contain significant revenues from its silicon film tm manufacturing and sales  the predominant source of its product revenues to date has been recycled wafer products 
product sales are recognized upon shipment 
solar cell prices and manufacturing costs vary depending upon supply and demand in the market for solar cells and modules and the costs of raw materials  particularly reclaimed silicon wafers  order size  yields  the costs of raw materials  particularly reclaimed silicon wafers recycled from the semiconductor industry and other factors 
in addition  the company also earns revenue from contracts with various federal governmental agencies to conduct research on advanced silicon film tm products as well as optoelectronic devices 
generally  these contracts last from six months to three years 
the company recognizes research contract revenue at the time costs benefiting the contracts are incurred  which approximates the percentage of completion method 
solar cells manufactured by the company are sold to original equipment manufacturers that assemble the solar cells into modules 
modules are sold to distributors and value added resellers 
the sale of a module results in substantially more revenue to the company than the sale of solar cells  due to the value of the additional materials  labor and overhead added during the module assembly process 
accordingly  the company s product sales are affected not just by changes in total solar cells produced  but by changes in the mix between solar cells and modules sold 
in the company commenced manufacturing modules in substantial quantities as a means of expanding its customer base 
currently  the gross margin percentages for modules are less than that of solar cells 
the company has developed a proprietary process called silicon film tm for the manufacture of sheets of polycrystalline silicon 
wafers made from these sheets are used in the company s solar cell manufacturing process 
silicon film tm technology has been under development since the company s inception in and  after several successful field tests  silicon film tm products are currently being shipped to selected customers 
for the year ended december   of the company s product revenues were generated by sales to customers located outside of the united states 
the company believes that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its product sales for the foreseeable future 
current sales are denominated in us dollars and foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had an impact on the company s results of operations 
substantially all of the company s revenues from government contracts are subject to audit under various federal statutes 
although the company has received final written acceptance of its overhead rates through  it has been advised that the defense contract audit agency is disputing certain elements of those submissions as well as those overhead rates for and the dispute is centered on the effect of the company s manufacturing operations on its government contract overhead rates during the years of transition from a contract research and development organization to commercial manufacturing 
the overhead rates for have been submitted  but have not yet been audited 
this dispute does not affect the company s overhead rates for and  inasmuch as the company revised its methodology for determining overhead rates 
it is management s opinion that adjustments to revenue  if any  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition  but may impact future results of operations 
on february   the company made an initial public offering of its common stock pursuant to which it sold  shares at per share  resulting in proceeds to the company of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs paid by the company 
the following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues product sales research contracts total revenues cost of revenues product sales research contracts total cost of revenues gross profit product development expenses general and administrative expenses selling expenses income loss from operations other expense income net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss results of operations years ended december  and revenues

during the first half of  the company incurred start up costs such as the hiring and training of new employees and facility operating costs  but generated little revenue to offset such costs 
in the second half of  the quantities of product manufacturing increased and generated revenues  but the gross margins remained below those of the company s other manufacturing facility 
the company expects further improvement in the product gross margins in as the production levels in the mw facility continue to increase 
product gross margins in the fourth quarter were also affected by disruptions to the manufacturing process caused by the installation of new manufacturing equipment  the qualification of new vendors and the large numbers of new employees required to be hired and trained 
these issues are expected to continue to negatively affect the company s financial results for the first half of gross profit on research contract revenues for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  from  for the year ended december  gross profit margin on research contracts revenue for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was attributable to a reduction in the company s contract overhead rates as a result of the ongoing transition to a manufacturing company  which reduces the amount of overhead expenses that were previously allocated and billed to government contracts

the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million for the same respective periods 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million   and  for the years ended december    and respectively 
the net cash from operating activities represents primarily the cash flows from income loss plus depreciation partially offset by changes in working capital 
the fluctuations in cash provided by or used in operations is due primarily to changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable  inventories and net income loss 
net cash used in investing activities was million   and  for the years ended december   and respectively  all of which represented expenditures for capital equipment 
the increase in expenditures during was primarily due to the outfitting of the second manufacturing facility 
as of december   the company s outstanding commitments for capital expenditures aggregated  net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in february  the company made an initial public offering of its common stock  pursuant to which it sold  shares at per share  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs paid by the company 
in august  the company issued a convertible note for million to corning 
on october  the company repaid the million convertible promissory note 
as part of this transaction  related research and development and security agreements were terminated 
options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock were cancelled and rights of first refusal with respect to financing  merger  licensing  and sales of assets were terminated 
approximately million of the amount advanced by corning was used towards the funding of the company s new manufacturing facility  including plant  equipment and working capital 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  represented private placements of securities and bank debt

during the company entered into an agreement with a financial institution for a million line of credit secured by accounts receivable and bearing interest at the prime rate 
in addition  the company has established a million revolving credit facility with the same financial institution that bears interest at the prime rate and will be secured by accounts receivable  inventory  and machinery and equipment 
these facilities expire in september  and there were no borrowings against these facilities at december  the company believes that cash generated from operations  its current cash balance  and the funds available under its bank borrowings  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s projected working capital and planned capital expenditures for the next months 
income taxes net operating loss carryforwards nol s totaling approximately million are available through to reduce federal and state taxable income as of december  during the company made the determination that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the nol will be realized and accordingly eliminated the valuation allowance for financial reporting purposes 
effects of inflation and exchange rates the company has not been materially affected by inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation or foreign exchange rates in the future 
year the company s current data processing systems and certain embedded processing systems are not year compliant 
the company has developed and is currently executing a comprehensive risk based plan designed to make its computer systems  those certain embedded processing systems  applications and facilities year ready 
the plan covers four stages including i inventory ii assessment  iii remediation  and iv testing and certification 
at year end  the company had substantially completed the inventory stage for its company owned systems and applications 
the assessment and remediation processes are currently underway and the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace where necessary  and test the software for year modifications 
the remediation process is targeted to be largely completed by june  testing and certification of these systems and applications are targeted for completion by september  the company s ongoing transformation from a government research and development organization to a manufacturing company has necessitated system enhancements to accommodate this growth 
the company is therefore addressing the year issue through these planned system augmentations 
total year costs for the company owned systems and applications were approximately  in and currently estimated to be approximately  in  which are expected to be funded through operating cash flows 
a majority of these costs are currently believed to be incremental costs that will not recur in the year or thereafter 
the company is initiating communications with its critical third party relationships to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to such parties failure to resolve their own year issues 
where practicable  the company will assess and attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of these entities to be year ready through the development of appropriate contingency plans 
the effect  if any  on the company s results of operations from the failure of such parties to be year ready  is not presently reasonably estimable
