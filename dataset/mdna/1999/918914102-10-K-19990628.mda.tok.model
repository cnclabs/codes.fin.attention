item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in to develop and commercialize advanced rechargeable batteries based on lithium and polymer technologies 
since its inception  the company has been a development stage company primarily engaged in acquiring and developing its initial technology  manufacturing limited quantities of prototype batteries  recruiting personnel  and acquiring capital 
to date  other than insubstantial revenues from limited sales of prototype batteries  the company has not received any significant revenues from the sale of products 
substantially all revenues to date have been derived from a completed research and development contract with the delphi automotive systems group of general motors corporation delphi formerly delco remy division 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of  from its inception to march  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  market acceptance  changing economic conditions  risks in product and technology development  effect of the company s accounting policies and other risk factors detailed in this section as well as in the section entitled business 
readers should also carefully review the factors set forth in other reports or documents filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  particularly the quarterly reports on form q and any other current reports on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the five year summary of selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
all references to years represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted 
results of operations fiscal years ended march  fiscal  march  fiscal and march  fiscal during fiscal  the company continued development activities under a research and development agreement with delphi 
the first phase of the original multi year agreement  which provided for aggregate funding of up to  was completed during the quarter ending september  in september  the company and delphi signed a new five year agreement to combine efforts in developing the company s rechargeable solid state lithium polymer battery technology 
under the agreement  delphi and the company combined their research and development activities in a new facility in henderson  nevada 
the new facility is owned by the company  and delphi paid a fee of  per month over the five year term of the new agreement for access to the company s research and development of which   and  were recognized during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively as an offset to research and product development expenses 
in addition  delphi paid a portion of the facility s operating costs through august the company has treated both of these payments as an offset to expenses 
in may  the company and delphi announced the successful completion of their collaboration on lithium polymer battery development 
delphi will retain a license to use company developed lithium polymer technology for vehicular and stationary load leveling peak shaving applications 
the company will retain a license to use delphi developed lithium polymer technology in all other applications 
the company anticipates that it will receive no further payments as a result of the joint research and development agreement with delphi 
the final payment of  was received on june  and was recorded as a component of other income 
research and product development expenses were   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal versus fiscal and fiscal versus fiscal reflects the company s increased efforts to commercialize a product  including increases in purchasing  machine design engineering  testing  and production raw materials for debugging equipment 
marketing expenses were   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in expenditures between fiscal and fiscal is the result of the completion of the severance process for two highly compensated former employees during fiscal no further severance expense was required in the marketing efforts in were a concentration on core product development 
the comparative increase from fiscal to fiscal was the result of higher travel expenses  the utilization of consultant services  and increased payroll which included substantial severance expense 
general and administrative expenses were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease is due to the reduction of payroll partially offset by compensation expenses of  related to the extension of certain vested stock options 
the fiscal increase was due to severance expenses of  related to the extension of certain vested options offset by decreased legal costs associated with the shareholder class action lawsuit 
interest and other income was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the termination payment from delphi offset by decreased investment income 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal resulted from fewer funds being available for investment 
interest expense was   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is the result of additional long term debt acquired during the fiscal year 
the decrease in fiscal was the result of a reduction in long term debt associated with capital equipment leases 
equity in the earnings losses of the hanil valence co 
ltd joint venture was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the earnings in fiscal were primarily the result of favorable exchanges in foreign currency 
the losses in fiscal years and were the result of start up costs for the joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources the company used  net cash for operating activities during fiscal  whereas it used  during fiscal and  during fiscal  an increase between fiscal and fiscal of  this increase as well as an increase between fiscal years and of  primarily resulted from research and development losses incurred with efforts to commercialize the company s products 
during fiscal  the company used  net cash from investing activities compared to using  during fiscal  while providing  of cash during fiscal the usage in fiscal was primarily the result of continuing capital equipment expenditures 
the increase in usage between fiscal years and was a result of increased capital equipment expenditures and the shortening of investment maturities to support those expenditures 
the company provided  of net cash from financing activities during fiscal as compared to  in fiscal and used  during fiscal the increase of  in fiscal resulted from proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and loans from a principal stockholder 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal of  resulted from reductions in long term debt and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
as a result of the above  the company had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  during fiscal versus a decrease of  during fiscal as of march   the company had two outstanding letters of credit totaling  which were collateralized by certificates of deposit equal to the full amount of the letters of credit 
in july  the company completed private financing arrangements of up to million 
the company issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock at  per share and warrants  raising gross proceeds of  with transaction costs of  in december  the company completed the equity portion of the financing arrangements  issuing  shares of series b convertible preferred stock at  per share and warrants  raising gross proceeds of  with transaction costs of  the series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock accrete at an annual rate of per year  and are convertible into common stock based upon defined conversion formulas 
the remaining  of the financing arrangements is in the form of a line of credit arrangement described below 
under the terms of the certificate of designations of the preferred stock and the warrants  the preferred stock investor may not convert the preferred stock or exercise the warrants if after by doing so the investor will own more than of the company s common stock 
in july  the company entered into an amended loan agreement with a stockholder  affiliated with a director  which allows the company to borrow  prepay and re borrow up to the full  principal under the promissory note on a revolving basis and provided that the lender will subordinate its security interest to other lenders when the loan balance is at zero 
as of march   the company had an outstanding balance of  under the loan agreement 
the loan bears interest at one percent over lender s borrowing rate approximately at march  and is available through august in connection with certain borrowings from a stockholder and director  the company issued a total of  warrants for the purchase of common stock with exercise prices of between and per share  subject to certain adjustments 
in fiscal  a total of  warrants were exercised at an exercise price of per share payable through the cancellation of  of indebtedness including accrued interest 
the warrants expire on the earlier of the effective date of a reorganization of the company  as defined  or july  the warrants were deemed to have a nominal value at their date of issuance 
in fiscal  the remaining  warrants were exercised at per share 
in fiscal  in conjunction with an amended loan agreement with a stockholder  the company issued warrants to purchase  and  shares of common stock with an exercise price of 
during fiscal  the company  through its dutch subsidiary  signed an agreement with the northern ireland industrial development board the idb to open an automated manufacturing plant in northern ireland in exchange for capital and revenue grants from the idb 
the company has also received offers from the idb to receive additional grants 
the grants available under the agreement and offers  for an aggregate of up to l   us  generally become available over a five year period through october  as of march   the company had received grants aggregating l   us reducing remaining grants available to l   us as of march  
as a condition to receiving funding from the idb  the subsidiary must maintain a minimum of l  in debt or equity financing from the company 
aggregate funding under the grants is limited to l  until the company has recognized  in aggregate revenue from the sale of its batteries produced in northern ireland 
given that the company has no agreements to supply batteries using its current technology  there are no assurances that the company will be able to meet the agreement s revenue test 
the amount of the grants available under the agreement and offers is primarily dependent on the level of capital expenditures made by the company 
substantially all of the funding received under the grants is repayable to the idb if the subsidiary is in default under the agreement and offers  which includes the permanent cessation of business in northern ireland 
funding received under the grants to offset capital expenditures is repayable if related equipment is sold  transferred or otherwise disposed of during a four year period after the date of grant 
in addition  a portion of funding received under the grants may also be repayable if the subsidiary fails to maintain specified employment levels for the two year period immediately after the end of the five year grant period 
the company has guaranteed the subsidiary s obligations to the idb under the agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet the requirements necessary for it to receive and retain grants under the idb agreement and offers 
the major components of construction in progress with their estimated costs and start dates are as follows mixing  coating  etching  laminating and slitting equipment   march  assembly equipment   march  extraction  packaging  and conditioning equipment   august  and factory improvements and miscellaneous equipment   june the estimated completion date for these major categories of construction in progress is the end of the third quarter of fiscal these statements are forward looking statements  and actual costs and completion dates are subject to change due to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including the availability of funds for completion  the risk that actual costs will be materially greater due to unforeseen difficulties in completion of the projects  reliance on manufacturers to deliver equipment in a timely manner and that performs as intended  and other risks and uncertainties 
at march   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and available credit under a line of credit with a stockholder of  the company expects that its existing funds and available line  together with the interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations through the first quarter of fiscal the company anticipates that  after taking into account projected revenues and receipt of funds from other sources  it will need to raise in either a debt or equity financing a minimum of million to fund planned capital expenditures  research and product development  marketing and general and administrative expenses and to pursue joint venture opportunities in fiscal the company s cash requirements  however  may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in the company s operations  including changes in oem relationships or market conditions 
there can be no assurance that funds for these purposes  whether from equity or debt financing agreements with strategic partners or other sources  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
these factors raise substantial doubts about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
the effects of such adjustments  if necessary  could be material 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the balance sheet  and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  currently  the company does not hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
year compliance many existing software programs  computers and other types of equipment were not designed to accommodate the year and beyond 
if not corrected  these computer applications and equipment could fail or create erroneous results 
for valence  this could disrupt purchasing  manufacturing  sales  finance and other support  thereby causing potential lost sales and additional expenses 
our state of readiness our year project encompasses both information and non information systems within valence as well as the investigation of the readiness of our strategic suppliers vendors 
we have created a year project team that is responsible for planning and monitoring all year activities and reporting to our executive management 
it has been reviewing valence s year status for approximately six months now  and has identified and evaluated crucial areas of concern regarding year compliance 
we define year compliance to be  with respect to information technology  that the information technology accurately processes date time data including  but not limited to  calculating  comparing  and sequencing from  into  and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  and the years and and leap year calculations  to the extent that other information technology  used in combination with the information technology being acquired  properly exchanges date time data with it 
fixes have begun on a majority of these areas 
other areas are still being tested 
our goal is to have all year issues resolved by december  to that end  we have inventoried and assessed the year readiness of the following vendors service providers 
we have distributed letters and questionnaires to all vendors and service providers that are critical to the day to day operations of valence 
we have received a letter of compliance from our fire alarm company that our current fire alarm system is in compliance 
we are waiting for certification from our electric utility company  however we do have a standby kw generator with enough fuel to run four weeks 
environmental  health  safety and security systems 
we have been advised by statewide fire electronics that the fire alarm systems within our plant are yk compliant 
however  they are dependent on our electric utility company  nevada power 
a nevada power representative said that when yk approaches  they will be off the national grid and will be on their own power 
nevada power is powered by two generating stations  one is coal powered and the other is gas powered 
the company believes that nevada power has a sufficient amount of coal for the coal powered station 
the other station  which is gas powered  will be dependent on southwest gas 
statewide fire protection co 
who makes and inspects our sprinklers  risers and hydrant systems said that the system is not electrical and our fire system is in compliance 
the henderson fire department has advised us that it is yk compliant 
as part of their disruption preparations they are planning to have additional manpower working and a spare fuel truck on site 
in the event of a power outage  the fire department will man local recreation centers with personnel equipped with radios 
in the event of an emergency  or if phone service is disrupted  we will be able to go to the manned recreation center closest to valence which is the black mountain recreation center on horizon 
the ems system said that is not currently compliant  but they will be compliant by the end of june 
the new system is a reverse calling system that will be set up to warn neighbors in the event of a chlorine release from timet or any other bmi complex industries 
the residential neighbors will receive an electronic message that tells them to shelter in place or any other necessary instructions 
our emergency lights will work on battery back up long enough to allow employees to evacuate the building 
we will be closed during yk but security guards will maintain the building 
wells fargo  our security provider  said we will be covered 
the security computer that regulates badge entry into the building has been backdated to we anticipate no issues with security 
we are furnishing the guards with extra chains and padlocks in the event the doors need to be secured manually 
conclusion there are no known areas of concern as related to ehs functions 
operations and process equipment 
in reviewing the compliance of all operations and process equipment in the henderson facility  no compliance issues where found 
statements from equipment vendors were obtained to verify this 
personal computers 
all personal computer bioss basic input output systems are being tested for year compliance 
currently of all novell network servers are year compliant 
currently of all user workstations are known to have a year bios 
currently of the personal computers that operate equipment have been tested 
only of these have a year compliant bios 
we have patched the computers that are not year compliant with a tsr  a software program that loads at computer startup  that will report the correct date and time to the operating system 
this method has been tested and provides acceptable results 
all northern ireland primary engineering drawing software is fully compliant as well as our general office software  which has been upgraded to microsoft office  which is compliant 
our fourth shift manufacturing system in its current bit database form is not compliant 
an upgrade to the bit database is planned for august september at a cost of lk approximately 
laboratories 
the maccor lab is in the process of being upgraded 
machines are being upgraded and patched for year the lab is complete for bios and operating system testing and fixes 
the electrical chemistry lab is patched and tested 
the data acquisition software run by these machines has been tested and we have concluded that there is a minor year bug 
this may be fixed by a slight program change or upgrading to a newer version of the software 
this does not affect the ending results of the data 
the northern ireland lab is complete for bios and operating system testing and fixes 
lantastic network version  which networks the maccor cyclers  is not compliant 
lantastic version has been purchased and is being installed currently complete 
maccor has been contacted concerning their data acquisition software compliance 
the dedicated pcs for qc lab equipment are also being bios checked 
currently are compliant  were made compliant with the tsr  with another to be tested compliant 
all software which interfaces with the instruments is being checked  with so far responding as compliant 
one instrument is known not to be compliant and will cease to function in september but we are currently considering whether to backdate the system date 
this is a feasible option since we have not previously collected data with this instrument or taken advantage of a reduced price upgrade offer by the manufacturer 
automated machinery 
the manufacturing machinery is controlled primarily by plcs programmable logic controllers and in some cases an industrial pc is added as the mmi man machine interface 
not all plcs are date aware their function also does not require it and therefore would not be affected 
we are currently tracking systems which fall in this category  of which have already been fully certified  that are compliant but waiting for vendor written certification  awaiting replies  and with known issues 
the three systems with known issues require a software upgrade which will cost l   each 
in house systems 
one database has been tested and is known not to be compliant 
a programmer has been hired to rewrite the database in another platform making it year all other databases at the us facility are year compliant  and the year project team is reviewing the databases at the northern ireland facility 
the accounting software is not compliant and an upgrade has been received 
the upgrade will be installed in early july the badge security system is not compliant and will need to be replaced or fixed 
at present  the system has been backdated to and there are no apparent problems with this fix 
there is no critical data or integration that will be affected by this change 
a task force has been assembled and will look into issues that may have been overlooked and to help continue the efforts to make our facilities compliant 
valence s phone system has been upgraded and is now year compliant 
the e mail system is not year compliant and replacements are being evaluated 
the voice mail system is not year compliant and will be upgraded as soon as replacement e mail software is selected 
microsoft office has been implemented throughout the facility and is patched with all of microsoft s latest patches 
a new backup system has been purchased and is being implemented to replace a backup system that is yk compliant but will not be supported after december  costs to address the year spending for modifications and updates is being expensed as incurred and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
the cost of our year project is being funded through available funds 
we estimate that our total year expenditures will not be material 
through the end of  valence had incurred  in connection with its year compliance program  and is expected to incur approximately  during fiscal risk analysis like most business enterprises  we are dependent upon our own internal computer technology and rely upon the timely performance of our suppliers vendors 
a large scale year failure could impair our ability to timely complete our research and development  or deliver batteries with the exacting specifications that will be required by our customers  thereby causing potential lost sales and additional expenses  which would have a material adverse effect on valence  its financial condition and its results of operations 
our year project seeks to identify and minimize this risk and includes testing of our in house applications  purchased software and embedded systems to ensure that all such systems will function before and after the year we are continually refining our understanding of the risk the year poses to our suppliers vendors based upon information obtained through our surveys 
this refinement will continue through the rest of contingency plans our year project anticipates the development of contingency plans for business critical systems and manufacturing equipment as well as for suppliers vendors to attempt to minimize disruption to our operations in the event of a year failure 
we have not yet developed these plans  but will be formulating plans to address a variety of failure scenarios  including failures of our in house applications  as well as failures of suppliers vendors 
valence does not have an estimated completion date for its contingency plans 
cautionary statement year issues are widespread and complex 
while we believe we will address them on a timely basis  we cannot assure that we will be successful or that these problems will not materially adversely affect our business or results of operations 
to a large extent  we depend on the efforts of our suppliers and other organizations with which we conduct transactions to address their year issues  over which we have no control 
the statements regarding the expected outcome and timing of year efforts are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from our expectations due to unforeseen problems arising in connection with completion of our year program  the risk that we will fail to identify a year problem critical to the operations of valence  or that our vendors suppliers will suffer problems that will inhibit them from delivering their products to us on a timely basis 
risk factors and forward looking information this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
such statements refer to events that could occur in the future or may be identified by the use of words such as intent  plan  believes  correlative words  and other expressions indicating future events are contemplated 
such statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
in addition to the other information contained herein  readers of this report should carefully consider the following risk factors 
we have an immediate need for additional capital 
we have an immediate need for additional capital which  if not obtained  would cause us to reduce developmental efforts and impair or ability to commercialize our products 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and available credit under a line of credit with a stockholder of  we expect that our existing funds and available line  together with the interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to fund our operations through the first quarter of fiscal we anticipate that  after taking into account projected revenues and receipt of funds from other sources  we will need to raise in either a debt or equity financing a minimum of million to fund planned capital expenditures  research and product development  marketing and general and administrative expenses and to pursue joint venture opportunities in fiscal our cash requirements  however  may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including changes in oem relationships or market conditions 
there can be no assurance that funds for these purposes  whether from equity or debt financing agreements with strategic partners or other sources  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
these factors raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
the effects of such adjustments  if necessary  could be material 
we are a development stage company with no products currently available for sale 
we are a development stage company and cannot anticipate when  or if  we will ever have significant revenues from a product 
we have derived our revenues primarily from a research and development contract with delphi automotive systems group  which we completed in may we presently have no commercially developed and manufactured products available for sale  although we have developed working prototypes of our batteries 
these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty  and such adjustments  if necessary  could be substantial 
our current available capital and future revenues  if any  will not be sufficient to meet our future operating needs 
we have generally incurred operating losses since inception in and had an accumulated deficit of  as of march   the end of our fiscal year 
we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability in the future 
we have negative working capital and have sustained recurring losses related primarily to the research and development and marketing of our products 
we expect to incur significant losses in the future as we continue our product development  begin to build inventory and continue our marketing efforts 
we will need to secure additional financing in order to continue operations past unless we begin to generate significant operating revenue 
we will have to continue to devote a significant amount of management time to obtaining financing 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital  in which case we would need to reduce developmental efforts and may not be able to commercialize our products 
if we are unable to achieve profitability or we are unable to secure additional financing on acceptable terms  we will be unable to continue to fund our operations 
we are actively pursuing capital grant advances from the northern ireland industrial development board  such advances are contingent on us achieving cumulative revenues from the sale of batteries of million 
we may not achieve such cumulative revenue over the short term  or at all 
additionally  a lack of capital may require us to license to third parties rights to commercialize products or technologies we might otherwise seek to develop ourselves  and to scale back or eliminate our research and product development programs 
the unavailability of adequate funds would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we no longer have a collaborative partner to assist us in development of our batteries  which may limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
we have received substantially all our revenues to date from a research and development agreement with delphi automotive systems group  which we completed in may the delphi agreement was for joint development in the automotive market 
although we have held discussions with original equipment manufacturers oems in the portable consumer electronics and telecommunications markets about possible strategic relationships as a means to accelerate introduction of our batteries into these markets  we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any such alliances 
the use of alliances for our development  product design  volume purchase and manufacturing and marketing expertise can reduce the need for development and use of internal resources 
further  even if we could collaborate with a desirable partner  there is a chance that the partnership may not be successful 
the success of any strategic alliance is dependent upon  among other things  the general business condition of the partner  its commitment to the strategic alliance and the skills and experience of its employees 
because our batteries are only sold when incorporated into other products  we will need to rely on original equipment manufacturers to commercialize our products 
to be successful  our batteries must gain broad market acceptance 
in addition  our success will depend significantly on our ability to meet oem customer requirements by developing and introducing on a timely basis new products and enhanced or modified versions of its existing products 
oems often require unique configurations or custom designs for battery systems which must be developed and integrated in the oem s product well before the product is launched by the oem 
thus  there is often substantial lead time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized battery system and the commencement of volume shipments of the battery system to the oem referred to as the design in time 
if we are unable to design  develop and introduce products that meet oems and other customers exacting requirements on a timely basis  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
to determine the requirements of each specific application  we will be dependent upon oems and other intermediaries such as battery pack designers into whose products our batteries will be incorporated 
there is a risk that we will not receive adequate assistance from oems to successfully commercialize our products 
furthermore  there is a risk that the perceived safety risks associated with lithium  an element used in our batteries  will impede acceptance of our batteries by oems or end users 
we do not yet have the sales staff  support capabilities and distribution channels to distribute our products on a commercial scale 
to implement our strategy successfully  we may have to develop a sizeable sales staff and product support capabilities  as well as third party and direct distribution channels 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish sales and product support capabilities  or be successful in our sales and marketing efforts 
we may not be able to cost effectively manufacture our batteries 
to be successful  we must manufacture commercial  high quality quantities of our products at competitive costs 
we have produced prototype products that we believe have performance characteristics that are suitable for a broad market 
however  additional development will be required to enable us to consistently produce battery systems with these characteristics 
in addition  to achieve broad commercialization of our products  we will need to reduce manufacturing costs of our battery systems 
our batteries may not be able to be manufactured in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by customers 
even if our current research and development activities result in the design of batteries with commercially desirable characteristics  we will still have to be able to competitively manufacture these batteries 
our current manufacturing technology must be further developed before we will be able to manufacture our batteries in commercial quantities 
any failure to achieve acceptable yields of commercial quality batteries in commercial quantities  and thereby reduce unit manufacturing costs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are in the early stage of manufacturing  and if we are unable to develop manufacturing capability cost effectively  we will not be able to generate profits  manufacturing risks  potential capacity constraints and risks of proposed expansion 
to date  we have not manufactured batteries on a commercial scale 
any failure to achieve acceptable yields of commercial quality batteries in commercial quantities  and thereby to reduce our unit manufacturing costs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
until recently  our batteries have been only manufactured on our pilot manufacturing line  which is able to produce prototype cells in quantities sufficient to enable customer sampling and testing and product development 
we are currently in the early stages of transitioning production to an automated high volume production line that will work with our newest battery technology in our manufacturing facility in mallusk  ni the redesign and modification of the manufacturing facility  including its customized manufacturing equipment  will continue to require substantial engineering work and expenses and is subject to significant risks  including risks of cost overruns and significant delays 
in addition  in order to rapidly scale up the manufacturing capacity  we will need to begin fabrication of a second automated production line before completing full qualification of the first line 
in automating  redesigning and modifying the manufacturing processes  we have been and will continue to be dependent on several developers of automated production lines  which have limited experience in producing equipment for the manufacture of batteries 
a key determinant of our current and future production capacity and profitability is the production yield of our manufacturing process 
the redesign and modification of our manufacturing facility and the development and implementation of automated production lines will entail significant risks and will require a substantial investment of our capital 
as part of our manufacturing ramp up  we will need to hire and train a substantial number of new manufacturing workers 
the availability of skilled and unskilled workers in northern ireland  the site of our manufacturing facility  is limited due to a relatively low unemployment rate 
we may not successfully develop improved processes  design required production equipment  enter into acceptable contracts for the fabrication of such equipment  obtain timely delivery of such equipment  implement multiple production lines or successfully operate the mallusk facility 
we may not be able to successfully automate our production on a timely basis or at all  and such automation may not result in greater manufacturing capacity or lower manufacturing costs than our pilot production line 
customer relationships could be damaged if we fail to begin volume manufacturing on a timely basis 
such failure could cause lost opportunities and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are experiencing delays in qualifying our manufacturing facilities 
we have been unable to meet our prior schedules regarding delivery  installation  de bugging and qualification of the northern ireland production equipment 
as most of the production equipment is being specially manufactured for us  further problems may develop and cause further delay in our current schedules 
we are improving and bringing many of the manufacturing processes that we are implementing in this production equipment up to date for the first time from our laboratory scale prototype work 
we may need to further refine the improved processes  which could cause substantial delays in the qualification and use of this equipment 
furthermore  if we are able to refine our process  we may not be able to produce the required amount of qualification samples to potential customers 
from our discussions with potential customers  we expect that customers will require an extensive qualification period once the customer receives its first commercial product off a production line 
we are dependent on our suppliers for certain key raw materials to develop and manufacture our batteries 
we are dependent on sole or limited source suppliers for certain key raw materials used in our products 
we generally purchase sole or limited source raw materials pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time and have no long term contracts or other guaranteed supply arrangements with our sole or limited source suppliers 
our suppliers may not be able to meet our requirements relative to specifications and volumes for key raw materials and we may not be able to locate alternative sources of supply 
we may not be able to purchase raw materials at an acceptable cost 
in addition  the raw materials which we utilize must be of a very high quality and we have at times in the past experienced delays in product development due to the delivery of nonconforming raw materials from our suppliers 
uncertainty of market of our batteries  our reputation 
to achieve market acceptance  our batteries must offer significant price and or performance advantages over other current and potential alternative battery technologies in a broad range of applications 
our rechargeable batteries may not be able to achieve or sustain any such advantages 
even if our rechargeable batteries provide meaningful price or performance advantages  there is a risk our batteries may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance in any potential market application 
the success of our products also will depend upon the level of market acceptance of oems and other customers end products which incorporate our batteries  over which we have no control 
if our rechargeable batteries do not achieve and maintain significant price and or performance advantages over other technologies and achieve significant and sustained market acceptance  or if customers applications which incorporate our products do not achieve lasting market acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we do manufacture our batteries in commercial quantities and they fail to perform as expected  our reputation could be severely damaged  which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our batteries even if the defect were corrected 
rapid evolution of battery technologies 
the battery industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  rapid technological change 
various companies are seeking to enhance traditional battery technologies  such as lead acid and nicd  and other companies have recently introduced or are developing rechargeable batteries based on nickel metal hydride nimh  lithium and other emerging and potential technologies 
competing technologies that outperform our batteries could be developed and successfully introduced and as a result  there is a risk that our products may not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments 
dependence upon management  attraction and retention of key employees 
our business is highly dependent upon the active participation of our senior management personnel 
we do not have written employment contracts with any key employees and do not maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  and marketing personnel who are familiar with and experienced in the battery industry 
competition for such personnel  in particular for product development and product implementation personnel  is intense  and we compete in the market for such personnel against numerous companies  including larger  more established companies with significantly greater financial resources than us 
we have at times experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel 
our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our competitors may develop batteries similar or superior to ours or otherwise compete more successfully than we do 
competition in the battery industry is intense 
the industry consists of major domestic and international companies  most of which have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than those that we have 
although we believe that our batteries will compete in most segments of the rechargeable battery market  there is a risk that other companies may develop batteries similar or superior to our batteries 
in addition  many of these companies have name recognition  established positions in the market  and long standing relationships with oems and other customers 
while there is significant development work being done by these competitors on various battery systems including electrochemistries such as nicd  nimh and lithium  we believe that much of this effort is focused on achieving higher energy densities for low power applications such as portable electronics 
one or more new  higher energy rechargeable battery technologies could be introduced which could be directly competitive with or be superior to our technology 
we believe that our primary competitors are existing suppliers of lithium ion  competing polymer and in some cases nimh batteries 
our primary competitors include matsushita industrial co  ltd  sony  toshiba  saft america  inc saft and polystor corp 
all of these companies are very large and have substantial resources and market presence 
we expect that we will compete against other types of batteries in the targeted application segments on the basis of performance  cost and ease of recycling and there is a risk that we may not be able to compete successfully against manufacturers of other types of batteries in any of the targeted applications 
in addition  in the rechargeable battery market there are a variety of competing technologies 
the capabilities of many of these competing technologies have improved over the past year  which has resulted in a customer perception that our technology may not offer as many advantages as previously anticipated 
there is a risk that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents and that any of our issued patents will not afford protection against a competitor 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on whether we can protect our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we rely on a combination of patent and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and cross licensing agreements 
nevertheless  such measures may not be adequate or safeguard the proprietary technology underlying our batteries 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their non disclosure agreements with us  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
moreover  notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may be able to develop products that are equal or superior to our products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries 
if existing or future patents containing broad claims are upheld by the courts  the holders of such patents could require companies to obtain licenses 
if we are found to be infringing third party patents  there is a risk that we may not be able to obtain licenses to such products on reasonable terms  or at all 
our failure to protect our proprietary technology may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions 
therefore  our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and any of our issued patents may not afford protection against a competitor 
our batteries contain potentially dangerous material  which could expose us to liability 
battery technologies vary in relative safety as a result of their differing chemical compositions 
in the event of a short circuit or other physical damage to the battery  a reaction may result with excess heat or a gas being released and  if not properly released  may be explosive 
we have designed our batteries to avoid this risk  but if we are unsuccessful  we could be exposed to product liability litigation 
our products will incorporate potentially dangerous materials  including lithium ions 
while these materials are less reactive than other potentially dangerous materials found in other types of batteries such as metallic lithium  which is known in its metallic form to cause explosions and fires if not properly handled  it is possible that these materials will require special handling 
it is possible that safety problems may develop in the future 
we are aware that if the amounts of active materials in our batteries are not properly balanced and the charge discharge system is not properly managed  a dangerous situation may result 
other battery manufacturers using technology similar to ours include special safety circuitry within the battery to prevent such a condition 
we expect that our customers will have to use such circuitry 
we have not completed safety testing our batteries and will not be able to commercially sell our batteries until we successfully complete the safety tests 
we have conducted extensive safety testing of our batteries and will in the short term submit batteries to ul for certification 
as part of our safety testing program  prototype batteries of various sizes  designs and chemical formulations are subject to abuse testing  where the battery is subjected to conditions outside the expected normal operating conditions of the battery 
while some prototype batteries have survived these tests  others have vented gases containing vaporized solvents and have caught fire 
such results were generally expected  and until we have completed testing we cannot make a valid determination as to the conditions in which the battery must be operated 
additionally  each new battery design requires new safety testing 
therefore  safety problems may develop with respect to our battery technology that could prevent or delay commercial introduction 
safety risks in our facilities could create delays 
we incorporate safety policies designed to minimize safety risks in our research and development activities and will do so in our manufacturing processes 
there is a risk  however  that an accident in our facilities will occur 
any accident  whether with the use of a battery or in our operations  could result in significant delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries  which would adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
the strict regulatory environment in which we operate may delay shipments and impose additional costs on us 
prior to the commercial introduction of our batteries into a number of markets  we may need to seek approval of our products by one or more of the organizations engaged in testing product safety and or agencies regulating transportation 
there is a risk that such agencies would not permit our batteries to be shipped or used by the general public  and that changes in regulations  or in their enforcement  will impose costly requirements or otherwise impede the transport of lithium 
if we are able to obtain such approvals  they could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and delays in shipments and  if redesign were necessary  could result in further delays in the introduction of our products 
because of the risks generally associated with the use of lithium  we expect rigorous enforcement 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental and health and safety controls on the storage  use and disposal of certain chemicals and metals used in the manufacture of lithium polymer batteries 
although we believe our activities conform to current environmental regulations  there is a risk that changes in such environmental regulations will impose costly equipment or other requirements 
any failure by us to adequately control the discharge of hazardous wastes could also subject us to future liabilities 
we are involved in lawsuits which could negatively impact our business 
we are subject to litigation arising from time to time in the course of our business 
we currently have three substantial lawsuits in which we are involved 
the first is a class action lawsuit by a class of persons who purchased our common stock between may  and august  alleging our violation of federal securities laws and seeking unspecified damages 
the second involves a claim by a manufacturer of one of our pieces of manufacturing equipment that we owe it approximately  and in which we have filed a counterclaim against the manufacturer seeking damages to be determined at trial 
the third is a contract claim we instituted against several parties  in which one party filed a counterclaim against us others claiming damages of approximately  based on breach of a contract  and which is presently stayed pending settlement discussions 
these lawsuits are more fully described in item legal proceedings 
although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these suits  if any of them is resolved unfavorably to us it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the failure of our key suppliers and customers to be year compliant could negatively impact our business 
we use a number of computer software programs and operating systems in our internal operations  including applications used in financial business systems and various administration functions 
to the extent that these software applications contain source code that is unable to appropriately interpret the upcoming calendar year  some level of modification or even possible replacement of such source code or applications will be necessary 
given the current information  we currently do not anticipate that such year costs will have a material impact upon us 
we have requested information regarding year compliance from suppliers and providers of all of our mission critical software systems and have obtained some responses 
based on the information we currently have  all mission critical systems appear to be year compliant 
we are currently contacting major vendors and customers to obtain year compliance certificates 
the failure of any of our key suppliers or customers to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
political instability in northern ireland may delay progress in our northern ireland facility 
the current political instability in northern ireland  which to date has had no negative impact on our manufacturing plant  could cause delays in completing our manufacturing capability or in manufacturing our batteries 
such delays could cause us to miss significant sales and marketing opportunities  as such delays will force our potential customers to find other vendors to meet their needs 
control by existing stockholders 
as of june   our officers  directors and their affiliates as a group beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
effect of anti takeover provisions 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our capital stock are subject to the rights of the holders of the series a and series b preferred stock and will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
while we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock  such issuance  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of valence technology  inc furthermore  our classified board of directors and certain other provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and series a and series b preferred stock 
if the issuance of our preferred stock was in violation of nasdaq s listing maintenance requirements  or we otherwise fail to continue to meet nasdaq s listing maintenance requirements  nasdaq may delist our common stock 
in late january  nasdaq released its guidance on future priced securities and the necessity of the issuer to comply with nasdaq s listing maintenance requirements in issuing these securities 
we believe that the issuances of our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock do not violate these criteria  and that we are in compliance with nasdaq s listing maintenance criteria 
however  in the event that nasdaq were to determine that the issuance of our series a preferred stock and or series b preferred stock was in violation of the nasdaq listing maintenance requirements  or if we are otherwise unable to continue to meet nasdaq s listing maintenance requirements  nasdaq may delist us 
such delisting could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and on the levels of liquidity currently available to our stockholders 
we may not be able to satisfy these requirements on an ongoing basis 
conversion of preferred stock and sales of common stock by cc investments may depress the price of our common stock and substantially dilute your stock 
if cc investments were to exercise all of the warrants it holds and convert all of the shares of preferred stock it owns  as of june  it would have acquired approximately  shares of our common stock 
the number of shares into which the preferred stock converts increases at per year 
if cc investments exercises the warrants or converts our preferred stock into shares of common stock and sells the shares into the market  such sales could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock and will dilute your holdings in our common stock 
additionally  dilution or the potential for dilution could materially impair our ability to raise capital through the future sale of equity securities 
volatility of stock price  no dividends on common stock 
the market price of the shares of common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
factors such as the fluctuation in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  governmental regulation  developments in our patent or other proprietary rights or our competitors  including litigation  developments in our relationships with current or future collaborative partners  and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock 
we have never paid any cash dividends and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
possible variable conversion of series b preferred stock 
after july   the series b preferred stock may become convertible into more shares than otherwise if our common stock trades at a price below in six out of ten consecutive trading days 
for example  if on july  our common stock in the previous ten trading days had been trading at or above  the  shares of series b preferred stock would be convertible into approximately  shares of our common stock 
if  however  on that date the average of the lowest six closing bid prices of our common stock over the previous ten trading days referred in the table below as the average price had been a lower price  then the series b preferred stock would have converted into a greater number of shares 
the following table illustrates this effect average number of shares into which the  price shares of series b preferred would convert the effect of this variable conversion rate  if it becomes applicable  will be to depress further the market price of our common stock and to dilute further stockholder holdings in our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we considered the provisions of financial reporting release no
