status of year activities many computer systems and software products refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead 
if not corrected  these programs could cause date related transaction failures 
although we currently believe that our systems are year compliant in all material respects  our current systems may contain undetected errors or defects with year date functions that may result in material costs 
in  we developed a compliance assurance process to address the problem 
a project team  headed by the vice president information technology  has performed a detailed assessment of all internal computer systems  and computing related equipment in all facilities 
our primary vendors  material suppliers  service suppliers and banks have been asked to verify their year readiness 
we plan to conduct audits at key supplier locations by june  our computer operations provider and disaster recovery site have advised us they will be compliant by the same date 
our central computing hardware and operating software have been updated and are now compliant 
while many of our machine tools use programmable logic controllers  they operate independently and are not connected to a computer network 
these controllers will be tested by march  costs in late  we purchased and began implementation of the yk ready j 
d 
edwards enterprise requirement planning system at an investment of over million to replace existing business systems and to strengthen internal controls  all of which is year compliant 
purchase of this system was not accelerated because of year and implementation costs are not material 
internal costs specifically associated with modifying our business systems software were not material and are expensed as incurred 
year risks in light of our relatively new business systems and computing infrastructure and the fact that manufacturing operations are not computer integrated  we believe the internal risks are manageable 
however  we are subject to external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as utility or transportation year compliance failures and related service interruptions 
further  to the extent the operations of any of our major customers are affected  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition
