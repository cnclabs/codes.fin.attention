item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations since  the reading has been principally engaged in the beyond the home or real estate based segment of the entertainment industry 
over the past five years  reading has reviewed and pursued a number of cinema acquisition opportunities 
the company has attempted to concentrate efforts on markets which  in the view of management  offer better potential returns than the exhibition of conventional film product in the highly competitive united states market 
these markets have included australian  new zealand and puerto rican markets for conventional film exhibition and the united states market for upper end art and foreign film 
this development oriented approach has meant that a longer period of time has been required to convert reading s cash and cash equivalent assets into income producing assets than would have been the case if reading had acquired existing cinemas 
it has also meant that reading has had significantly higher general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  than would a mature cinema exhibition company  or a company not actively involved in long term real estate development 
in addition  the company has retained most of the senior executive staff needed to carry the company through its development phase and to operate the company s cinema and real property assets  even though most of the company s screens are currently in development and are not anticipated to be producing material income in the next year 
at the end of  reading  either directly or through its various joint venture relations  had screens in operation 
based solely upon the development of locations under development as to which the company has signed letters of intent  leases  or current ownership of the land  this number should increase to approximately screens by the end of the company believes that this strategy will ultimately result in greater profitability and better long term returns including both operating profits from exhibition and long term gains from real estate development  than would the purchase of an existing cinema circuit 
this is particularly true given the significant number of obsolete cinemas held by most of the circuits which have been offered for sales in recent periods 
however  this strategy will also necessarily mean lower reported profits in the initial periods until operating revenues increase to cover general and administrative expense  and until the long term rewards of real estate ownership are realized 
the company has begun the development of circuits in australia and new zealand 
at the end of  reading australia had four cinemas with screens 
reading australia anticipates adding an additional six cinemas with screens in  for a total of screens 
reading new zealand has entered into a joint venture with an experienced operator 
that joint venture now operates two modern multiplex theatres in the auckland area  and has a third cinema under construction  which is scheduled to open in in australia and new zealand  the company is attempting to take advantage of the foot traffic generated by a successful multiplex theater by developing entire entertainment centers 
these centers typically include a state of the art multiplex cinema  complementary restaurant and retail uses  and convenient parking  all on land owned by the company 
due to the competition for suitable cinema sites  and the company s view that currently attractive markets in australia and new zealand will likely be developed in a relatively short period of time  the company has attempted to maximize the number of potential cinema locations by purchasing or otherwise acquiring rights to acquire a number of entertainment center sites over the past months 
this has adversely effected short term profitability  as significant amounts have been invested in undeveloped land  or land which is otherwise not currently income producing 
however  it has given the company a level of assurance that it will have the sites available to it needed to execute its business plan for australia and new zealand 
to date  the company s development activities have been funded with cash resulting  in large part  from the disposition of reading s historic rail road and operating businesses  and from the disposition of the stater bros 
preferred stock and citadel preferred stock acquired by reading in the l stock transactions 
a significant portion of this cash approximately  has gone from interest earning cash balances and short term investments to non income producing property which is currently under development or held for development 
the company s assets remain largely unencumbered 
it is clear  however  that the company will need to borrow funds in order to complete its currently planned buildout and development projects 
reading believes that it should be able to raise the capital needed to fund its build out  as currently staged over the remainder of  and in  the company determined to expand its beyond the home entertainment activities from cinemas into live theater 
during the latter portion of that year  reading entered into agreements to purchase seven live theaters 
three of these theaters are in manhattan the minetta lane  orpheum and union square 
the remaining four are located in a single complex  the royal george  in chicago 
all of these theatres feature smaller off broadway type plays 
the acquisition of the royal george theater in chicago was completed in march it is anticipated that the acquisition of the manhattan theaters will close in the second quarter of this year 
in addition  reading recently entered into an agreement giving it the right  through may  to present plays at the marines theatre  in san francisco 
accordingly  the company anticipates booking eight live theatres in three major metropolitan areas by mid results of operations due to the nature of the company s development and acquisition activities and the timing associated with the results of such activities  the effect of litigation awards and settlements  a recapitalization of the company the stock transactions in the fourth quarter of  the timing of new cinema openings and acquisitions  and the long term nature of the company s real estate development activities  historical revenues and earnings have varied significantly 
the company s entertainment center developments are for the most part in the early stage of development and generally will not produce income or cash flow for at least eighteen to twenty four months from the time that all development approvals have been secured and construction commenced 
it is anticipated that one of the company s entertainment center projects currently under development will open late in accordingly  general and administrative expenses related to such real estate development activities will not be supported by operating income in the near term 
further  although the company s cinema operations are anticipated to expand significantly during  the company anticipates operating at a loss in  since many of the new cinemas are not expected to commence operations until the fourth quarter of and most of the company s real estate activities will continue in the development stage 
in addition  interest and dividend revenues will decrease as the company deploys its cash and cash equivalents in its real estate and cinema development projects 
management believes that historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results

currency transactions during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into several foreign currency swaps and a currency forward position with a major bank 
the agreements provided for the company to receive  us dollars usd in return for the delivery of  australian dollars aud in january the value of the contracts at december  was established by computing the difference between the contractual exchange rates of the swap and forward positions aud usd and the exchange rates in effect at december  and an unrealized gain of  was recorded in from these transactions which gain has been included in other income 
during the first quarter of  the currency positions and extensions thereof matured and the company recorded a loss which totaled approximately liquidity and capital resources since the company determined to become principally involved in the beyond the home or real estate based segment of the entertainment industry in  it has funded its development activities principally from cash derived from the disposition of its historic railroad assets and other operating interests 
in  in view of the substantial capital resources required to take advantage of the opportunities available to it in this industry  the company acquired assets with a gross book value of  from a private placement of its equity securities 
this increased the company s shareholders equity by approximately although the company still has little or no debt  the company s cash assets are now  in essence  fully committed 
a substantial portion of the company s cash has been invested or internally committed to development projects which will not be generating income until the latter portion of or early in addition  approximately  has been invested in land  currently held for development as entertainment centers  and  has been invested in a acre development site in melbourne  which though initially acquired as an entertainment site  is now being reviewed for possible alternative development 
these assets are  in large part  presently unencumbered 
to the extent that assets are encumbered with mortgage debt  such debt exists primarily at the level of certain of the company s unconsolidated affiliates  such as wpg 
this decision to commit substantial resources to the acquisition of sites reflects the company s view that the key to the successful penetration of the australian market was the acquisition of a sufficient number of sites to assure the potential to develop a critical mass of cinema assets  and the need to acquire these sites before the major cinema operators in australia could control the markets which will be serviced by these sites 
the company believes that this element of its business plan for australia has been achieved 
the company believes that it has sufficient cash on hand to complete the projects and acquisitions currently slated for completion in this includes the anticipated addition of screens in australia increasing the screen count in that market from to screens  screens in the united states increasing the screen count from to screens  screens in puerto rico increasing the screen count from to screens and screens in new zealand increasing the screen count from to screens 
it is the company s current plan to leverage these assets as they commence operations  and to use the proceeds from such financings to continue the development program through the year the company estimates that the total development cost of all of its entertainment center projects will exceed  in the event that such debt financing cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to the company  consideration will be given to seeking joint venture partners  issuing debt or equity securities  delaying development of certain projects and or selling land currently held for development  or other assets 
the company is also in discussion with various lenders concerning the possibility of construction period finance 
the company does not currently consider any of its assets to be held for sale 
the company does have commitments in excess of its current cash and cash equivalent assets 
at december   the company had total commitments of  of this amount  it is currently anticipated that approximately  will be funded in  and approximately  will be funded in or after included among these commitments is a  credit facility to be made available by the company and a  option payment to be funded in connection with the cinema transactions  both of which are unlikely to be funded before the fourth quarter of  a contractual obligation to construct an entertainment center in victoria  at an estimated remaining cost of  currently anticipated to be completed in late or early  a  obligation to purchase a  stall car park structure located adjacent to property located in central wellington  and held for entertainment center development by an unconsolidated entity in new zealand  and  in obligations to acquire additional open land in new zealand 
as a consequence of the company s business plan for australia and new zealand  the company is carrying significantly more land than might be the case with a more mature cinema company 
the acquisition of these properties has required the commitment of significant sums 
since the acquired properties are not currently income producing  the financing of such assets is more difficult and more expensive than would be the financing of cash flowing assets 
accordingly  the ability for the company to continue its buildout program will be dependent in large part upon the performance of the approximately new screens being constructed in while the company has taken care in the identification of these cinemas  no assurances of success can be given 
for this and a variety of other reasons  including without limitation both local and international economic issues  the availability of financing on reasonable terms  and the health generally of the film exhibition industry in the markets serviced by the company  no assurances can be given that the financing needed for the company to carry out its business plan into and to meet its longer term commitments can be given 
however  the company is pleased with the progress made to date and is confident in the ultimate success of its build out program

in addition to operating expenses  other uses of liquid funds in included  the purchase of the ny angelika for  total purchase price of  net of a credit of  for a judgment secured by a portion of the stock of the seller of the ny angelika the angelika judgment and the minority partner contribution of  the purchase of the citadel common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein for  purchases  primarily by reading australia  of  in property and equipment and a net increase in amounts receivable of  the stock transactions the stock transactions permitted the company to acquire assets which could be converted into cash or utilized as collateral to raise cash funds necessary to finance the company s theater and real estate development activities and consolidate craig and the company s interest in reading international in order to reduce the complexity of the company s corporate structure 
with the exception of reading international  the non cash assets received in the stock transactions  the stater preferred stock and the preferred stock of citadel the citadel preferred stock were converted into cash in and in the stock transactions  the company received  of cash from citadel 
in return the company issued to citadel   in stated value  shares of the company s series a voting cumulative preferred stock the series a preferred stock and granted citadel certain contractual rights including the asset put option the asset put option 
the asset put option grants citadel the right to require the company to acquire substantially all of citadel s assets and assume related liabilities in return for the issuance of common stock at any time through a date days after the company files its annual report on form k 
the number of shares to be issued will be determined by dividing the appraised value of the citadel assets or million  whichever amount is lower  by 
if the appraised value of the citadel assets is in excess of million  the company will issue common stock at fair market value for such excess up to a total of million in citadel assets 
the company received from craig the stater preferred stock with a stated value of  the citadel preferred stock with a stated value of  and craig s interest in reading international 
in return  rei issued to craig   shares of common stock and  shares  stated value of series b voting cumulative preferred stock the series b preferred stock 
the stock transactions were accounted for as a reorganization of related entities requiring that the company reflect the assets received at the lower of the value which they were recorded on the books of the affiliates 
the stock transactions were intended to qualify as an exchange under section a a exchange of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in a exchange  the party acquiring the assets in the stock transactions  rei retains the contributing parties tax basis in the acquired assets  with no taxable gain recognized as a result of the exchange 
the parties contributing assets in the stock transactions  craig and citadel obtain a basis in the assets received in the exchange equal to the basis in the assets which are contributed in the exchange the series a and series b preferred stock 
with the exception of the stater preferred stock  the book value of the assets received in the stock transactions approximated the tax basis in the assets received 
craig s adjusted tax basis for federal tax purposes in the stater preferred stock was approximately million 
the estimated tax liabilities associated with the assets received in the stock transactions were  in deferred federal income taxes primarily relating to the stater preferred stock 
at the time of the closing of the stock transactions  the company had a gross deferred federal tax asset of  and a tax asset valuation allowance the tava in the same amount 
upon receipt of the stater preferred stock  the company determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset which had previously been fully reserved  would be realized and the company reduced the tava by  which amount reflects the amount of federal tax loss carry forwards nols which were expected to be utilized net of  in alternative minimum tax amt 
a portion of the reversal of the tax asset valuation allowance   was included in income tax benefit in the company s consolidated statement of operations in and was subsequently reclassified from retained earnings to other capital 
the balance   was credited directly to other capital in the company s consolidated statement of shareholders equity in the amount which was included in income was equal to the nols which remained available to the company and which existed as of the date of the company s quasi reorganization 
at the time of the company s quasi reorganization  the company also realized a loss relating to the conveyance of certain assets to conrail and charged such loss directly to other capital 
the benefits of nols relating to such charge cannot be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company has no nols which existed at the time of the company s quasi reorganization and therefore  future reductions in the company s tax valuation allowance will be reflected as income in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company issued common stock and the convertible preferred stock in exchange for the assets received in the stock transactions 
the convertible preferred stock was reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the company at december  at its stated value per share  which value management believes approximates market 
the series a preferred stock has not been included as a component of shareholders equity since it includes provisions which permit a majority of the holders to request redemption at stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends for a day period beginning october  and also provides for redemption at the option of the majority of the holders  if the company fails to pay four quarterly dividends or in event of a change in control 
in addition to issuing the series a preferred stock  the company also granted the asset put option to citadel  which under certain circumstances permits citadel to exchange substantially all of its assets for common stock 
the company did not allocate any value to the asset put option due in part to the subjective nature of the assumptions utilized in option pricing models and the fact that stock option valuation models are intended to value options and the asset put option is not transferable 
had a value been separately ascribed to the asset put option  the value of such option would have been deducted from the value of the series a preferred stock and included as other capital in the company s consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
in addition to the dividend payable on the million of convertible preferred stock  the company has elected to include as a component of preferred stock dividends in its calculation of net loss income applicable to common shareholders  a provision which totaled approximately  in   in and  in for the amortization of the value of the asset put option based upon a valuation utilizing the black scholes option valuation model 
management believes that the tax gain related to the stater preferred stock recognized by the company was offset by the company s nol carry forwards see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
however  the amount of nols carried on the books of the company has not been audited by the internal revenue service the irs  and there can be no assurance that the irs would agree with the company as to the amount of nol available to offset such gains 
use of the nols is subject to certain limitations  including those resulting from certain changes in the ownership of the company
