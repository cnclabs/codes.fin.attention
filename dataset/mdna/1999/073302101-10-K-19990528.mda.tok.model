item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual experience may differ materially from that anticipated in such statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors contained in exhibit hereto  as well as future events that may have the effect of reducing our available operating income and available cash balances  such as unexpected operating losses or delays in the integration of our acquired businesses  conditions in the airline industry  customer delivery requirements  new or expected refurbishments  cash expenditures related to possible future acquisitions  delays in the implementation of the company s integrated management information system  labor disputes involving us  our significant customers or airframe manufacturers  delays or inefficiencies in the introduction of new products or fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
introduction dollars in thousands  except per share data b e aerospace  inc b e is the world s largest manufacturer of commercial and general aviation aircraft cabin interior products  serving virtually all major airlines and a wide variety of general aviation customers and airframe manufacturers 
management believes that the company has achieved leading global market positions in each of its major product categories  which include aircraft seats  food and beverage preparation and storage equipment  galley and other interior structures  oxygen delivery systems  lighting systems and in flight entertainment systems 
in addition  b e provides design  integration  installation and certification services  offering its customers in house capabilities to design  project manage  integrate  test and certify reconfigurations and modifications for commercial aircraft cabin interiors and to manufacture related products  including engineering kits and interface components 
b e also provides upgrade  maintenance and repair services for its airline customers around the world 
b e s revenues are generally derived from two primary sources refurbishment or upgrade programs for the existing worldwide fleets of commercial and general aviation aircraft and new aircraft deliveries 
b e believes its large installed base of products  estimated to be approximately  as of february  valued at replacement prices  gives it a significant advantage over competitors in obtaining orders for refurbishment programs  principally due to the tendency of the airlines to purchase equipment for such programs from the original supplier 
b e s revenues are generated primarily from programs initiated by the airlines that may vary significantly from year to year in terms of size  mix of products and length of delivery 
during the most recent airline industry recession  which ended in  the airlines significantly depleted their cash reserves and incurred record losses 
in an effort to improve their liquidity  the airlines conserved cash by reducing or deferring cabin interior refurbishment and upgrade programs and purchases of new aircraft 
as a result  in contrast with historical experience  b e experienced declines in both new aircraft and refurbishment programs 
since early  the airlines have experienced a significant turnaround in operating results  with the domestic airline industry achieving record operating earnings during calendar years through consequently  during fiscal b e experienced significant growth in backlog  revenues and operating earnings 
this growth is a reflection of the airlines need to begin refurbishing worn fleets and their ability to do so as a result of the strengthening of the airlines balance sheets 
the company has substantially expanded the size  scope and nature of its business as a result of a number of acquisitions 
since  b e has completed acquisitions  including four major acquisitions in fiscal  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  in order to position the company as the preferred global supplier to its customers 
during the period from to  the company acquired nine commercial aircraft cabin interior products manufacturers for approximately  through these acquisitions  b e built worldwide market leadership positions and became the number one manufacturer for a great number of its product offerings 
at the same time  the company rationalized its businesses and began re engineering operations 
we integrated the acquisitions by eliminating operating facilities and consolidating personnel at the acquired businesses  resulting in headcount reductions of approximately  employees through january the impact of these efforts is evidenced by the improvement in gross margin before special costs and charges 
during the five year and three year periods ended february   the company s gross margin expanded by basis points and basis points  respectively  ending at for fiscal similarly  the company has expanded its operating margin before special costs and charges from in fiscal to in fiscal the acquisitions completed during fiscal are collectively referred to as the acquisitions 
while the company will continue to be susceptible to industry wide conditions  management believes that the company s significantly more diversified product line and revenue base achieved through acquisitions has reduced its exposure to demand fluctuations in any one product area 
as a result of the acquisitions  the company has recorded a charge of  for the write off of in process research and development and other acquisition related expenses associated with the company s acquisitions 
in process research and development expenses arose from new product development projects that were in various stages of completion at the respective acquired companies at the dates of such acquisitions 
in process research and development expenses related to products under development at the dates of such acquisition that had not established technological feasibility and for which no alternative use had been identified were written off 
the in process research and development projects have been valued based on expected net cash flows over the product life  costs to complete  the stage of completion of the projects  the result of which has been discounted to reflect the inherent risk associated with the completion of the projects  and the realization of the efforts expended 
for a more complete description of in process research and development costs  see note to the company s financial statements 
on february   the company sold a interest in its in flight entertainment ife business to a wholly owned subsidiary of sextant avionique  sa sextant 
sextant  which supplies complete avionics systems for both military and civil aircraft  is one of the world s leading suppliers of aircraft avionics systems  is a wholly owned subsidiary of thomson csf  and the largest supplier of such systems to airbus industrie 
terms of the agreement provide for sextant to acquire its interest in ife for an initial cash purchase price of  the final purchase price will be determined on the basis of operating results for the joint venture over its initial two years of operations and could range from  to  for financial reporting purposes  the company recorded a gain on this transaction the ife sale of approximately  which has been reflected as a component of transaction gain  expenses and other expenses in its statement of operations for the year ended february  and has deferred  of the initial purchase price subject to the determination of the final purchase price described above 
the company used substantially all of the net proceeds to repay bank borrowings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began to implement a restructuring plan designed to lower its cost structure and improve its long term competitive position 
this plan includes eliminating seven of its principal facilities  reducing the total number from to  reducing its employment base by approximately and rationalizing its product offerings 
the company recognized a charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of  to provide for the entire amount of restructuring  along with costs associated with new product introductions  all of which was charged to cost of sales  of which  is related to north american facilities 
these costs and charges are comprised of  related to impaired inventories and property  plant and equipment related to the rationalization of its product offerings  new product introduction costs of  and severance and related separation costs  lease termination and other costs of  the worldwide reduction in facilities  personnel and product offerings will aid the company in several ways 
it will strengthen the global business management focus on the core product categories  achieve a more effective leveraging of resources and improve the company s ability to rapidly react to changing business conditions 
the rationalization of product offerings  which was brought about as a result of the acquisitions and the large number of new product introductions during the past year  will provide an ongoing benefit of a generally lower cost structure 
pretax cash outlays associated with the restructuring program were not significant during fiscal  and are expected to be approximately  during fiscal cash requirements are expected to be funded from operations 
the company identified seven facilities  four domestic and three in europe  for consolidation 
the consolidation activities are expected to commence during the first quarter of fiscal and be substantially complete by the end of the fiscal year 
when fully implemented  management expects that this program will generate pretax savings of approximately   annually 
the assets impacted by this program include factories  warehouses  assembly operations  administration facilities  machinery and equipment and inventories 
the new product introduction costs represent costs incurred in bringing new products to market in volume for the first time and include tooling  engineering design and development  costs in excess of standard costs at budgeted manufacturing levels and related expenditures 
management anticipates that the company will continue to incur pressure on its gross margins during the upcoming year as it achieves learning curve efficiencies associated with the introduction of these new products in volume for the first time and as it implements its integrated management information system throughout the company  and such costs could be material 
over the last two fiscal years  the company s gross margins have improved substantially  increasing from in fiscal to in fiscal and to in fiscal before special costs and charges described above 
the primary reasons for the improvement in gross margins include a company wide re engineering program which has resulted in higher employee productivity and better manufacturing efficiency  higher unit volumes and improvement in product mix 
b e s business strategy is to maintain its market leadership position through various initiatives  including new product development 
in fiscal  research  development and engineering expenses totaled  or of net sales 
the following discussion and analysis addresses the results of the company s operations for the year ended february   as compared to the company s results of operations for the year ended february  the discussion and analysis then addresses the results of the company s operations for the year ended february  as compared to the company s results of operations for the year ended february  the discussion and analysis then addresses the liquidity and financial condition of the company and other matters

the increase in research  development and engineering expense is primarily attributable to ongoing new product development activities and the acquisitions 
amortization expense for fiscal of  was  greater than the amount recorded in the prior year  and is due to the acquisitions 
based on management s assumptions  a portion of the purchase price for the acquisitions was allocated to purchased in process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use 
during fiscal  the company recorded a charge of  for the write off of acquired in process research and development and other acquisition related expenses 
such amount has been presented as a component of transaction gain  expenses and other expense in the accompanying financial statements 
management estimates that the research and development cost to complete the in process research and development related to projects will aggregate approximately  which will be incurred over a five year period 
in february  the company sold a interest in ife to sextant for an initial cash purchase price of  the final purchase price will be determined on the basis of the operating results for the joint venture over its initial two years of operations and could range from  to  accordingly   of the proceeds have been deferred at february  and are included in other liabilities

year over year  the company experienced an increase in seating products revenues of approximately  or  a  or increase in interior systems products revenues and a  or increase in in flight entertainment products revenues 
the revenue increases for the seating products and in flight entertainment groups are primarily the result of retrofit programs that seven of the ten largest airlines in the world have commenced  while the increase in revenues for the interior systems products group is primarily related to both the surge in new aircraft deliveries and the increase in retrofit activity 
gross profit was  or of sales  for the year ended february  and was  or greater than the prior year s gross profit of  which represented of sales 
the increase in gross profit  while primarily the result of the higher sales volume  was also positively impacted by the basis point improvement in gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  for the year ended february  this was  or higher than the selling  general and administrative expenses for the prior year of  of sales  and is primarily due to the higher level of sales and quotation activity  as well as a higher level of customer service  product support and information technology activities 
research  development and engineering expenses were  or of sales  for the fiscal year ended february  for the prior year  research  development and engineering expenses were  or of sales

net earnings were  or 
per share basic and 
per share diluted  for the year ended february   as compared to  or 
per share basic and 
per share diluted  for the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements consist of working capital needs  ongoing capital expenditures and scheduled payments of interest on its indebtedness 
b e s primary requirements for working capital have been directly related to increased accounts receivable and inventory levels as a result of revenue growth 
b e s working capital was  as of february   as compared to  as of february  at february   cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to  at february  the primary use of cash during the current fiscal year was  for the acquisitions 
cash provided from operating activities was  for fiscal the primary source of cash during fiscal was the net loss of  offset by non cash restructuring and transaction charges of  decreases in accounts receivable of  and increases in accounts and income taxes payable and accrued and other liabilities of  offset by a use of cash of  related to increases in inventories and other current assets 
the company s capital expenditures were  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the development of a new management information system to replace the company s existing systems  many of which were inherited in acquisitions  and expenditures for plant modernization 
the management information system is expected to be installed over months and is year compliant 
those facilities slated for implementation after september are currently year compliant 
the company anticipates ongoing annual capital expenditures of approximately  for the next several years to be in line with the expanded growth in business and the recent acquisitions 
the company s bank credit facility consists of a  revolving credit facility and an acquisition facility of  the revolving credit facility expires in august and the acquisition facility is amortizable over five years beginning in august the bank credit facility is collateralized by the company s accounts receivable  inventories and by substantially all of its other personal property 
at february   indebtedness under the existing bank credit facility consisted of letters of credit aggregating approximately  and outstanding borrowings under the acquisition facility aggregating  bearing interest at libor plus  or approximately as of february  
the bank credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants  negative covenants and conditions of borrowing  all of which were met by the company as of february  in january  the company sold  of senior subordinated notes the notes 
in february  the company sold  of senior subordinated notes the notes 
in conjunction with the sale of the notes  the company initiated a tender offer for the  of senior notes due the notes 
the net proceeds from the offering of approximately  were used for the tender offer which expired on february  in which approximately  of the notes were retired  to call the remaining notes on march  and together with the proceeds from the bank credit facility  to partially fund the acquisitions 
the company incurred an extraordinary charge of  for unamortized debt issue costs  tender and redemption premiums and fees and expenses related to the repurchase of the notes

the notes  notes and notes mature on february   march  and november   respectively 
the notes  notes and notes contain restrictive covenants  all of which were met by the company as of february   including limitations on future indebtedness  restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  liens  dividends  mergers and transfers of assets 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations and availability under the bank credit facility will provide adequate funds for its working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements through the term of the bank credit facility 
the company believes that it will be able to refinance the bank credit facility prior to its termination  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company s ability to fund its operations  make planned capital expenditures  make scheduled payments and refinance its indebtedness depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which  in turn  are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond its control 
deferred tax assets the company has established a valuation allowance related to the utilization of its deferred tax assets because of uncertainties that preclude it from determining that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate taxable income to realize such asset during the operating loss carryforward period  which expires in such uncertainties include recent cumulative losses by the company  the highly cyclical nature of the industry in which it operates  economic conditions in asia which impact the airframe manufacturers and the airlines  the company s high degree of financial leverage  risks associated with the implementation of its integrated management information system  and risks associated with the integration of acquisitions 
the company monitors these as well as other positive and negative factors that may arise in the future  as it assesses the necessity for a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets 
year costs the year yk issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
because of this programming convention  software  hardware or firmware may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year use of non year compliant programs could result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruptions of operations or other business problems  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions and invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
b e technology initiatives program 
the company has experienced substantial growth as a result of having completed acquisitions since essentially all of the acquired businesses were operating on separate information systems  using different hardware and software platforms 
in fiscal  the company analyzed its systems  both pre existing and acquired  for year compliance with a view to replacing non compliant systems and creating an integrated year compliant system 
in addition  the company has developed a comprehensive program to address the year issue with respect to the following non system areas network switching  the company s non information technology systems such as buildings  plant  equipment and other infrastructure systems that may contain embedded microcontroller technology and the status of major vendors  third party network service providers and other material service providers insofar as they relate to the company s business 
as explained below  the company s efforts to assess its systems as well as non system areas related to year compliance involve a wide ranging assessment of the year problems that may affect the company  the development of remedies to address the problems discovered in the assessment phase and testing of the remedies 
assessment phase 
the company has identified substantially all of its major hardware and software platforms in use as well as the relevant non system areas described above 
the company has determined its systems requirements on a company wide basis and has begun the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system  which is intended to be a single system database onto which all the company s individual systems will be migrated 
in relation thereto  the company has signed contracts with substantially all of its significant hardware  software and other equipment vendors and third party network service providers related to year compliance 
remediation and testing phase 
in implementing the erp system  the company undertook and has completed a remediation and testing phase of all internal systems  lans  wans and pbxs 
this phase was intended to address potential year problems of the erp system in relation to both information technology and non information technology systems and then to demonstrate that the erp software was year compliant 
erp system software was selected and applications implemented by a team of internal users  outside system integrator specialists and erp application experts 
the erp system was tested between june to by this team of experts 
to date  eight locations have been fully implemented on the erp system 
this company wide solution is being deployed to all other b e sites in a manner that is designed to meet full implementation for all non year compliant sites by the year program to assess and monitor progress of third parties 
as noted above  b e has also undertaken an action plan to assess and monitor the progress of third party vendors in resolving year issues 
to date  the company has obtained guidance from outside counsel to ensure legal compliance  generated correspondence to each of its third party vendors to assess the yk readiness of these vendors  contracted a vendor yk fully automated tracking program to track all correspondence to from vendors  to track timely responses via an automatic computer generated trigger to provide an electronic folder for easy reference and retention and to specifically track internally identified critical vendors 
the company is also currently in the midst of developing an internal consolidated database of the company s vendors 
to monitor its third party vendors  the company has sent a correspondence mailing to targeted vendors and is currently following up on non deliverable letters and those vendors that indicated material problems in their replies 
the company believes that the majority of the required compliance and remediation with respect to these vendors will be completed in the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal contingency plans 
the company has begun to analyze contingency plans to handle the worst case year scenarios that the company believes reasonably could occur and  if necessary  intends to develop a timetable for completing such contingency plans 
costs related to the year issue 
to date  the company has incurred approximately  in costs related to the implementation of the erp system 
the company currently estimates the total erp implementation will cost approximately  and a portion of the costs have and will be capitalized to the extent permitted under generally accepted accounting principles 
risks related to the year issue 
although the company s efforts to be year compliant are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the year issue on the company s business and operations  the actual effects of the issue will not be known until the year difficulties in implementing the erp system or failure by the company to fully implement the erp system or the failure of its major vendors  third party network service providers  and other material service providers and customers to adequately address their respective year issues in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the company s capital requirements may differ materially from the foregoing estimate as a result of regulatory  technological and competitive developments including market developments and new opportunities in the company s industry 
see risk factors potential failure of computer systems to recognize year industry conditions the company s principal customers are the world s commercial airlines 
as a result  the company s business is directly dependent upon the conditions in the highly cyclical and competitive commercial airline industry 
in the late s and early s the world airline industry suffered a severe downturn  which resulted in record losses and several air carriers seeking protection under bankruptcy laws 
as a consequence  during such period  airlines sought to conserve cash by reducing or deferring scheduled cabin interior refurbishment and upgrade programs and delaying purchases of new aircraft 
this led to a significant contraction in the commercial aircraft cabin interior products industry and a decline in the company s business and profitability 
since early  the airlines have experienced a turnaround in operating results  leading the domestic airline industry to record operating earnings during calendar years through this financial turnaround has  in part  been driven by record load factors  rising fare prices and declining fuel costs 
the airlines have substantially restored their balance sheets through cash generated from operations and debt and equity placements 
as a result  the levels of airline spending on refurbishment and new aircraft purchases have expanded 
however  due to the volatility of the airline industry and the current general economic and financial turbulence  there can be no assurance that the profitability of the airline industry will continue or that the airlines will maintain or increase expenditures on cabin interior products for refurbishments or new aircraft 
in addition  the airline industry is undergoing a process of consolidation and significantly increased competition 
such consolidation could result in a reduction in future aircraft orders as overlapping routes are eliminated and airlines seek greater economics through higher aircraft utilization 
increased airline competition may also result in airlines seeking to reduce costs by producing greater price competition from airline cabin interior products manufacturers  thereby adversely affecting the company s revenues and margins 
recently  turbulence in the financial and currency markets of many asian countries has led to uncertainty with respect to the economic outlook for these countries 
of the company s  of backlog at february   approximately  is deliverable by the end of fiscal of the total backlog at february   the company had  with asian carriers 
of such asian carrier backlog  approximately  is with japan airlines  singapore airlines and cathay pacific 
although not all carriers have been affected by the current economic events in the pacific rim  certain carriers  including non asian carriers that have substantial asian routes  could cancel or defer their existing orders 
in addition  boeing has announced that in light of the continued severe economic conditions in asia  it will be substantially scaling back production of a number of aircraft types  including particularly wide body aircraft which require up to seven times the dollar content for b e s products as compared to narrow body aircraft 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of its debt 
foreign currency the company has direct operations in europe that receive revenues from customers in various currencies and purchase raw materials and component parts from foreign vendors in various currencies 
accordingly  the company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
the largest foreign currency exposure results from activity in british pounds and dutch guilders 
from time to time  the company and its foreign subsidiaries may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage risk on transactions conducted in foreign currencies 
at february   the company had no outstanding forward currency exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into any other derivative financial instruments 
directly and through its subsidiaries  the company sells to various customers in the european union which adopted the euro as their legal currency on january  the euro is already used for some financial transactions and expected to enter general circulation after a three year transition period ending january  the company has analyzed whether the conversion to the euro will materially affect its business operations 
the company s information systems are capable of processing transactions in euros 
additionally  the company is planning to upgrade certain of its information systems through december to enhance its capability to process transactions and keep records in euros 
the company does not expect costs in connection with the euro conversion to be material 
interest rates at february   the company had adjustable rate debt of approximately  and fixed rate debt of approximately  the weighted average interest rate for the adjustable and fixed rate debt was approximately and  respectively  at february  if interest rates were to increase by above current rates  the estimated impact on the company s financial statements would be to reduce pretax income by approximately the company does not engage in transactions intended to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of february   the company maintained a portfolio of securities consisting mainly of taxable  interest bearing deposits with weighted average maturities of less than three months 
if short term interest rates were to increase or decrease by  the company estimates interest income would increase or decrease by approximately
