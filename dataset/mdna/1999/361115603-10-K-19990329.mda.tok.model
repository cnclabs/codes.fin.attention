at december  compared to 
at december  the company s total assets at december  aggregated million compared to million at december  the company s restaurants are a cash business 
funds available from cash sales are not needed to finance receivables and are not generally needed immediately to pay for food  supplies and certain other expenses of the restaurants 
therefore  the business and operations of the company have not historically required proportionately large amounts of working capital  which is generally common among similar restaurant companies 
should dynamic foods expand its sales to third parties  the accounts receivable and inventory related to such sales could require the company to maintain additional working capital 
cafeteria operators has outstanding million of notes due december   including million of accrued interest 
under the terms of the notes  a semi annual cash interest payment of approximately million is due on each march and september the obligations of cafeteria operators under the notes are secured by a security interest in and a lien on all of the personal property of cafeteria operators and mortgages on all fee and leasehold properties of cafeteria operators to the extent such properties are mortgageable

the company intends to pursue a program of remodeling existing cafeterias and opening new restaurants 
the company anticipates expending approximately to million in fiscal year to remodel existing cafeterias and open new restaurants and to make other capital expenditures 
no assurance can be given that the company will generate sufficient funds from operations or obtain alternative financing sources to enable it to fully implement the anticipated capital expenditures 
the company  from time to time  considers whether disposition of certain of its assets  including its food processing and distribution operations  real estate owned in fee simple and leasehold interests or potential acquisitions of assets would be beneficial or appropriate for the long term goals of the company and in order to increase stockholder value 
in  the company entered into an amendment of a master sublease agreement pursuant to which it leased properties from kmart corporation kmart 
pursuant to the amendment  the aggregate monthly rent was reduced by percent for the period from the effective date of the amendment through and including december   and by percent following that date and until december  the reductions in rent were made subject to termination by kmart if mr 
lewis ceased to be chairman of the board of directors of the company 
mr 
lewis was not nominated for reelection at the company s annual meeting of stockholders on may  kmart in june demanded that the company pay increased rents  which the company has done while reserving its right to dispute kmart s right to receive the increased rental 
as a result of the increased rents  the company will pay additional rent of approximately million through december   includiong thousand additional rent paid in because the company accounts for its rental payments under the straight line method  the purported increase in rent through december  is being amortized over the remaining life of the leases  which run through december   december   june  and december  the increase in annual rent expense amounted to approximately thousand for fiscal and for the fiscal will amount to approximately thousand 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries and other defendants entered into a definitive settlement agreement that would resolve all outstanding claims among them related to the pending litigation and irs audit involving the company s pension plan 
see item legal proceedings 
the agreement is subject to confirmation by an independent actuary of the calculations that support the proposed settlement and approval of the settlement as fair to all members of the plaintiff class by the court 
the anticipated cash impact of the settlement on the company includes payment in of approximately million of expenses for legal and professional fees  with the remainder of the settlement to be paid to the plan in future years to fund increased benefit payments to former and current employees 
the settlement will not require any funding payments to the plan by the company in but is expected to require payments by the company to the plan of approximately million in and approximately thousand in  with additional funding payments required in subsequent years in amounts that are expected to decline over time  subject to the overall funding status of the plan 
year readiness disclosure some computers  software  and other equipment include computer code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result  some of these systems will not operate correctly after because they may interpret to mean  rather than these problems are widely expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year approaches  and are commonly referred to as the year problem 
the company believes that it has identified all significant digital systems and applications that will require modification to ensure year compliance 
the company has commenced the process of modifying  upgrading and replacing any digital systems that have been assessed as adversely affected  and estimates that its compliance activities will be substantially completed no later than the first quarter of the company estimates that the total costs of this effort during the and fiscal years will be less than  which is being funded through operating cash flows 
these estimates are based on management s assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of necessary resources and the effectiveness of hardware and software solutions provided by third parties and by the company s information technology staff 
the year problem may also affect parties who provide critical goods and services to the company  for example banks  credit card companies  utility providers and suppliers of raw and processed foodstuffs to the company s restaurants and its dynamic foods operation 
the company is evaluating the extent to which the company s operations are vulnerable to year problems of its material vendors and is seeking assurance of their year compliance status 
management believes that the company s reliance upon large volumes of independent consumer transactions at restaurant locations  operation of its own trucking fleet and utilization of the dynamic foods division to provide the majority of its food products limit some aspects of the company s year exposure 
however  the company s ability to assure year compliance by many critical vendors is very limited 
year failures by one or more of these vendors could disrupt materially the ability of the company to operate 
the company is in the process of preparing contingency plans to address the possibility of significant performance failures by its material vendors  which will include an analysis of advisable cash and inventory levels and identification of alternative suppliers of critical goods and services 
these plans are expected to be completed by june  there is no assurance that the company can adequately plan for contingencies that may be associated with year failures by these third parties  or that alternative suppliers will be available and themselves unaffected by year problems 
in particular  management is not able to predict with any assurance the effect of year problems in the food product industry or among the suppliers of utilities such as electricity  water and telecommunications to the company  and specifically to its dynamic foods operation 
an interruption of the operation of dynamic foods could require the company to close its restaurants until service can be resumed

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
the company purchases certain commodities used in food preparation 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature 
the company s long term debt does not expose it to market risk as all interest accrues at fixed rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage overall borrowing costs
