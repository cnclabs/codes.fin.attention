overview we acquire equity interests in mid sized investment management firms and currently derive all of our revenues from those firms 
we refer to firms in which we have purchased less than typically less than as our affiliates 
we hold investments in affiliates that managed billion in assets at december  our most recent affiliate investments were in essex march  dhja december and rorer january 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the partnership interests in the managers funds  lp managers  which serves as the adviser to a family of ten equity and fixed income no load mutual funds 
these mutual funds had a total of billion in assets under management at december  we have a revenue sharing arrangement with each of our affiliates which allocates a specified percentage of revenues typically for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses  including salaries and bonuses the operating allocation 
the remaining portion of revenues of the affiliate  typically the owners allocation  is allocated to the owners of that affiliate including amg  generally in proportion to their ownership of the affiliate 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for the managers of the affiliates by allowing them to participate in their firm s growth through their compensation from the operating allocation  to receive a portion of the owners allocation based on their ownership interest in the affiliate  and to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation which is available for growth initiatives and bonuses for management of the affiliate 
the managers of each affiliate  therefore  have an incentive to both increase revenues thereby increasing the operating allocation and their owners allocation and to control expenses thereby increasing the excess operating allocation 
the revenue sharing arrangements allow us to participate in the revenue growth of each affiliate because we receive a portion of the additional revenue as our share of the owners allocation 
however  we participate in that growth to a lesser extent than the managers of the affiliate  because we do not share in the growth of the operating allocation 
under the organizational documents of the affiliates  the allocations and distributions of cash to us generally take priority over the allocations and distributions to the management owners of the affiliates 
this further protects us if there are any expenses in excess of the operating allocation of an affiliate 
thus  if an affiliate s expenses exceed its operating allocation  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s management owners  until that portion is eliminated  and then reduce the portion allocated to us 
the portion of each affiliate s revenues which is included in its operating allocation and retained by it to pay salaries  bonuses and other operating expenses  as well as the portion of each affiliate s revenues which is included in its owners allocation and distributed to us and the other owners of the affiliate  are both included as revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
the expenses of each affiliate which are paid out of the operating allocation  as well as our holding company expenses which we pay out of the amounts of the owners allocation which we receive from the affiliates  are both included in operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
the portion of each affiliate s owners allocation which is allocated to owners of the affiliates other than us is included in minority interest on our consolidated statements of operations 
the ebitda contribution of an affiliate represents the owners allocation of that affiliate allocated to amg before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of that affiliate 
ebitda contribution does not include our holding company expenses 
the affiliates revenues are derived from the provision of investment management services for fees 
investment management fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management 
certain of the affiliates bill advisory fees for all or a portion of their clients based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other affiliates bill advisory fees for all or a portion of their clients based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  several of the affiliates charge performance based fees to certain of their clients  these performance based fees result in payments to the applicable affiliate if specified levels of investment performance are achieved 
all references to assets under management include assets directly managed as well as assets underlying overlay strategies which employ futures  options or other derivative securities to achieve a particular investment objective 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors including principally i the level of affiliate revenues  which is dependent on the ability of our existing affiliates and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients  and obtaining favorable investment results  ii the receipt of owners allocation  which is dependent on the ability of the affiliates and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  iii the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our investments  iv our success in attracting new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  v the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  vi the level of expenses incurred for holding company operations  including compensation for its employees  and vii the level of taxation to which we are subject  all of which are  to some extent  dependent on factors which are not in our control  such as general securities market conditions 
assets under management on a historical basis increased by billion to billion at december  from billion at december   in part due to the investments made in essex and dhja during excluding the initial assets under management at the dates of these investments  assets under management increased by billion as a result of billion in market appreciation and million from net client cash flows 
excluding assets managed using overlay strategies which generally carry fees at the lower end of the range of fees for directly managed assets  assets increased by billion for the year 
assets indirectly managed using such overlay strategies declined by billion for the year 
our investments have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting under which goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition of interests in affiliates over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including acquired client relationships 
as a result of the series of our investments  intangible assets  consisting of acquired client relationships and goodwill  constitute a substantial percentage of our consolidated assets and our results of operations have included increased charges for amortization of those intangible assets 
as of december   our total assets were approximately million  of which approximately million consisted of acquired client relationships and million consisted of goodwill 
the amortization period for intangible assets for each investment is assessed individually  with amortization periods for our investments to date ranging from nine to years in the case of acquired client relationships and to years in the case of goodwill 
in determining the amortization period for intangible assets acquired  we consider a number of factors including the firm s historical and potential future operating performance and rate of attrition among clients  the stability and longevity of existing client relationships  the firm s recent  as well as long term  investment performance  the characteristics of the firm s products and investment styles  the stability and depth of the firm s management team and the firm s history and perceived franchise or brand value 
we perform a quarterly evaluation of intangible assets on an affiliate by affiliate basis to determine whether there has been any impairment in their carrying value or their useful lives 
if impairment is indicated  then the carrying amount of intangible assets  including goodwill  will be reduced to their fair values 
while amortization of intangible assets has been charged to the results of operations and is expected to be a continuing material component of our operating expenses  management believes it is important to distinguish this expense from other operating expenses since such amortization does not require the use of cash 
because of this  and because our distributions from our affiliates are based on their owners allocation  management has provided additional supplemental information in this report for cash related earnings  as an addition to  but not as a substitute for  measures related to net income 
such measures are i ebitda  which we believe is useful to investors as an indicator of our ability to service debt  to make new investments and meet working capital requirements  and ii ebitda as adjusted  which we believe is useful to investors as another indicator of funds available which may be used to make new investments  to repay debt obligations  to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock 
results of operations supplemental pro forma information affiliate operations are included in our historical financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
we consolidate affiliates when we own a controlling interest and include in minority interest the portion of capital and owners allocation owned by persons other than us 
because we have made investments in each of the periods for which financial statements are presented  we believe that the operating results for these periods are not directly comparable 
substantially all of the changes in our income  expense and balance sheet categories result from the inclusion of the acquired businesses from the dates of our investments in them 
therefore  we have provided the following pro forma data  which should be read with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to such statements  which are included elsewhere in this report

we invested in gofen and glossberg in may  geocapital in september  tweedy  browne in october  and essex in march collectively  the new affiliates and included their results from the respective dates of investment 
our net loss after extraordinary item of million for the year ended december  resulted from a million extraordinary item  net of related tax benefit  from the write off of debt issuance costs related to the early extinguishment of debt 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the year ended december  such increase was primarily a result of the addition of the new affiliates

operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  compensation and related expenses increased by million to million  amortization of intangible assets increased by million to million  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million  and other operating expenses increased by million to million 
the growth in operating expenses was primarily a result of the addition of the new affiliates 
minority interest increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   primarily as a result of the addition of the new affiliates 
interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   as a result of the increased indebtedness incurred in connection with the investments in the new affiliates 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change in income tax expense is principally related to the increase in income before taxes in the year ended december  ebitda increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   primarily as a result of the inclusion of the new affiliates 
ebitda as adjusted increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  as a result of the factors affecting net income as described above  before non cash expenses such as amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of million for the year ended december  year ended december  as compared to year ended december  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the extraordinary item of million  net of related tax benefit  from the early extinguishment of debt 
before extraordinary item  net income was million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or over the year ended december  we invested in burridge in december  gofen and glossberg in may  geocapital in september and tweedy  browne in october  and included their results from their respective purchase dates 
in addition  we invested in first quadrant in march and its results were included in the results for the year ended december  from its purchase date 
revenues from these investments accounted for million of the increase in revenues from to while revenues from other existing affiliates increased by million to million 
performance based fees  primarily earned by first quadrant  increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  compensation and related expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the inclusion of the first quadrant  burridge  gofen and glossberg  geocapital and tweedy  browne investments accounted for million of this increase while the remainder of the increase was attributable to the increased compensation costs of amg personnel  including the cost of new hires 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  amortization of intangible assets increased by million as a result of the inclusion of the first quadrant  burridge  and gofen and glossberg  geocapital and tweedy  browne investments  which increase was offset by an impairment loss of million taken on the systematic investment during with no similar item in selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the first quadrant  burridge  gofen and glossberg  geocapital and tweedy  browne investments accounted for million of this increase and the remainder was primarily due to increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses as well as our other affiliates 
other operating expenses increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the results of operations of the new affiliates described above 
minority interest increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was as a result of the addition of new affiliates as described above and the remainder was due to the owners allocation growth at our existing affiliates 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of the increased indebtedness incurred in connection with the investments described above 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the change in effective tax rates from to is related primarily to the change in the provision for federal taxes from to in  we recorded a federal deferred tax benefit of  on a pretax loss of million 
in  we recorded a deferred tax expense of  on pretax income of million 
the deferred taxes account for the effects of temporary differences between the recognition of deductions for book and tax purposes primarily related to the accelerated amortization of certain intangible assets 
ebitda increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of the inclusion of new affiliates as described above and revenue growth 
ebitda as adjusted increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of the factors affecting net income as described above  before non cash expenses such as amortization of intangible assets  depreciation and extraordinary items of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities  bank borrowings  and the issuance of equity and debt securities in public and private placement transactions 
we anticipate that we will use cash flow from our operating activities to repay debt and to finance our working capital needs and will use bank borrowings and issue equity and debt securities to finance future affiliate investments 
our principal uses of cash have been to make investments in affiliates  to retire indebtedness  repurchase shares and to support our and our affiliates operating activities 
we expect that our principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for investments in additional affiliates  repayments of debt  including interest payments on outstanding debt  distributions of the owners allocation to owners of affiliates other than us  additional investments in existing affiliates  including upon management owners sales of their retained equity to us  and for working capital purposes 
we do not expect to make commitments for material capital expenditures 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of senior debt under our credit facility of million 
on january  we exercised our option to expand the credit facility from to million and added another major commercial bank to our group of lenders 
we have the option  with the consent of our lenders  to increase the facility by another million to a total of million 
our credit facility bears interest at either libor plus a margin ranging from 
to or the prime rate plus a margin ranging up to and matures during december in order to offset our exposure to changing interest rates we enter into interest rate hedging contracts 
see interest rate hedging contracts 
we pay a commitment fee of up to of on the daily unused portion of the facility 
our borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by pledges of all of our interests in affiliates including all interests in affiliates which are directly held by us  as well as all interests in affiliates which are indirectly held by us through wholly owned subsidiaries  which interests represent substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility contains a number of negative covenants  including those which generally prevent us and our affiliates from i incurring additional indebtedness other than subordinated indebtedness  ii creating any liens or encumbrances on material assets with certain enumerated exceptions  iii selling assets outside the ordinary course of business or making certain fundamental changes with respect to our businesses  including a restriction on our ability to transfer interests in any majority owned affiliate if  as a result of such transfer  we would own less than of such affiliate  and iv declaring or paying dividends on our common stock 
in order to provide the funds necessary for us to continue to acquire interests in investment management firms  including our existing affiliates upon the management owners sales of their retained equity to us  it will be necessary for us to incur  from time to time  additional long term bank debt and or issue equity or debt securities  depending on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or become available on terms acceptable to us 
net cash flow from operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash flow from operating activities from to was principally due to our investments in new affiliates in and net cash flow used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million  and million  respectively  were used to make investments in affiliates 
on march   we acquired a majority interest in essex 
we paid million in cash  in addition to  newly issued shares of our series c convertible non voting stock which converted into an equal number of shares of common stock on march  the company funded the cash portion of this investment with borrowings under its credit facility 
on december   we acquired a interest in dhja 
dhja is a houston based asset management firm with approximately billion of assets under management at december  on january   we acquired an approximately interest in rorer 
rorer is a philadelphia based investment adviser with approximately billion of assets under management at december  we paid million in cash for our investment in rorer 
we financed these two investments with borrowings under our credit facility 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the partnership interests in the managers funds  lp  which serves as the adviser to a family of ten equity and fixed income no load mutual funds 
these mutual funds had a total of billion in assets under management at december  this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions 
we intend to finance the investment with a borrowing under our credit facility 
net cash flow from financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and the principal sources of cash from financing activities has been from borrowings under senior credit facilities and subordinated debt  private placements of our equity securities and our initial public offering 
the uses of cash from financing activities during these periods were for the repayment of bank debt  repayment of subordinated debt  repayment of notes issued as purchase price consideration and for the payment of debt issuance costs 
on september   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which we could repurchase up to five percent of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
through december   we purchased  shares of common stock for million 
on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  of which  shares were sold by us and  shares were sold by selling stockholders 
we used the net proceeds from the  shares sold by us to reduce indebtedness and did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders 
year the year poses a concern to our business as a result of the fact that computer applications have historically used the last two digits  rather than all four digits  to store year data 
if left unmodified  these applications would misinterpret the year for the year and would in many cases be unable to function properly in the year and beyond 
we have based our evaluation of our ability to prepare for the year upon a number of assumptions regarding future events  including third party modification plans and the availability of needed resources 
we cannot guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
specific factors which might cause such material differences with respect to the year issue include  but are not limited to  the failure of our affiliates to achieve represented or stated levels of year compliance  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
amg s readiness in anticipation of this problem  we have identified all of the significant computers  software applications and related equipment used at our holding company that need to be modified  upgraded or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to our business based on the advent of the year we anticipate completing our year preparations at the holding company by the end of the second quarter of we estimate our total cost will be less than  for the four year period ending on december  we cannot be certain that we will not encounter unforeseen delays or costs in completing our preparations 
our affiliates readiness we have also established a time line with each of our affiliates to complete their year preparations and have received estimates from each of them of the costs required to complete their preparations 
as part of our general preparedness program  each of our affiliates has assigned responsibility for preparing for the year to a member of its senior management in order to ensure that both proprietary and third party vendor systems will be ready for the year each of our affiliates has completed its assessment and plans are in place for the renovation or replacement of all non compatible systems 
we anticipate that the affiliates will complete the renovation or replacement of all non compatible systems and the subsequent testing of all systems by the end of the second quarter of most of our affiliates pay for the costs of their year preparations out of their operating allocation  which is the portion of their revenues that is allocated to pay their operating expenses 
as a result  these costs will only reduce an affiliate s distributions to us based on our ownership interest in the affiliate if the affiliate s operating expenses exceed its operating allocation and the portion of revenues allocated to the management owners 
outside service providers outside service providers perform several processes which are critical to our affiliates business operations  including transfer agency and custody functions 
our affiliates have surveyed these parties and are monitoring their progress 
however  our affiliates have limited control  if any  over the actions of these outside parties and in some instances have no alternative vendors 
if outside service providers fail to resolve their year issues  we anticipate that our affiliates operations will experience material disruptions caused by the inability to process trades and access client and investment research data files and  accordingly  our and our affiliates businesses would be adversely affected 
interest rate sensitivity our revenues are derived primarily from fees which are based on the values of assets managed 
such values are affected by changes in the broader financial markets which are  in part  affected by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
with respect to our debt financings  we are exposed to potential fluctuations in the amount of interest expense resulting from changing interest rates 
we seek to offset such exposure in part by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
see interest rate hedging contracts 
our annual interest expense increases or decreases by  for each of change in interest rates assuming libor is between and and assuming current interest rate margins on current bank debt 
interest rate hedging contracts we seek to offset our exposure under our debt financing arrangements to changing interest rates by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
as of december   we were a party  with two major commercial banks as counterparties  to million notional amount of swap contracts which are designed to limit interest rate increases on our borrowings and are linked to the three month libor 
these swap contracts  upon quarterly reset dates  cap interest rates on the notional amounts at rates ranging between and 
when libor is below  our floating interest rate debt is swapped for fixed rate debt at rates ranging between and 
we generally borrow at libor and pay an additional interest margin as described above 
the hedging contracts limit the effects of our payment of interest at equivalent libor rates of or less on up to million of indebtedness 
as of january   we have entered into a swap contract to cap potential interest rate increases on million of the million notional amount of swap contracts identified above at 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain such hedging contracts at their existing levels of coverage or that the amount of coverage maintained will cover all of our indebtedness outstanding at any such time 
in addition  as noted above  our existing hedging contracts subject us to the risk of payments of higher interest rates when prevailing libor rates are less than 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at fair value 
fas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the implementation of fas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
economic and market conditions the financial markets and the investment management industry in general have experienced both record performance and record growth in recent years 
for example  between january  and december   the s p index appreciated at a compound annual rate of approximately and the aggregate assets under management of mutual and pension funds grew at a compound annual rate of during  according to the federal reserve board and the investment company institute 
domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance  among other factors  affect the financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry 
we cannot guarantee that broader market performance will be favorable in the future 
any decline in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a corresponding decline in our affiliates performance and may cause our affiliates to experience declining assets under management and or fees  which would reduce cash flow distributable to us 
international operations first quadrant limited is organized and headquartered in london  england 
tweedy  browne  based in new york  also maintains a research office in london 
in the future  we may seek to invest in other investment management firms which are located and or conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on first quadrant limited or other non us investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use interest rate swaps to manage market exposures associated with our variable rate debt by creating offsetting market exposures 
these instruments are not held for trading purposes 
in the normal course of operations  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk  and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings of the derivative instruments we held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps allow us to achieve a level of variable rate and fixed rate debt that is acceptable to us  and to reduce interest rate exposure 
in each of our interest rate swaps  we have agreed with another party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
under each of our interest rate swaps  interest rates on the notional amounts are capped at rates ranging between and upon quarterly reset dates 
in addition  if libor falls below at a quarterly reset date  we are required to make a payment to our counterparty equal to the difference between the interest rate on our floating rate libor debt on an annualized rate of between and  multiplied by the notional principal amount 
at december   a total of million of our outstanding debt was subject to interest rate swaps  the original swaps  and our exposure was to changes in three month libor rates 
beginning in january  we became a party to additional contracts with a million notional amount  the subsequent swaps 
these contracts are designed to limit interest rate increases to on this notional amount if three month libor rates fall below 
the hypothetical loss in earnings on all derivative instruments that would have resulted from a hypothetical change of percent in three month libor rates  sustained for three months  is estimated to be  because our net earnings exposure under the combined debt and interest rate swap was to three month libor rates  the hypothetical loss was calculated as follows multiplying the notional amount of the swap by the effect of a reduction in libor under the original swaps  partially offset by the subsequent swaps and interest savings on the underlying debt
