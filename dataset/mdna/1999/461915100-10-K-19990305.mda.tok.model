the company also engages in private banking transactions  including secured lending and deposit accounts 
on january   the company completed the issuance and sale of  in capital securities 
the capital securities were issued by investors capital trust l  a delaware statutory business trust sponsored by the company 
the capital raised in the offering  along with existing capital and earnings generated in the future  will be used to support the company s balance sheet growth 
the capital securities qualify as tier i capital under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve 
under current federal reserve guidelines  no more than of the company s tier capital may comprise capital securities and other capital securities and cumulative preferred stock of the company 
in september the company completed an exchange offer pursuant to which all outstanding capital securities were exchanged for substantially identical capital securities registered under the securities act of on may   the company acquired amt capital services  inc and an affiliated company amt capital  a new york based firm recognized for providing fund administration services to global and domestic institutional investment management firms 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of amt capital in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
upon completion of the acquisition  amt capital became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and was re named investors capital services  inc on october   the company completed the acquisition of the domestic institutional trust and custody business of bankboston  na under the terms of the purchase agreement  the company paid approximately million to bankboston as of the closing and will pay up to an additional million one year after the closing depending upon certain business performance criteria 
the business provides master trust and custody services to endowments  pension funds  municipalities  mutual funds and other financial institutions  primarily in new england 
the primary focus is small to midsize custody accounts ranging in size from million to million in assets 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with the acquisition  investors bank and bankboston also entered into an outsourcing agreement 
pursuant to the outsourcing agreement  the company will act as custodian for three bankboston asset management related businesses domestic private banking  institutional asset management and international private banking 
the company will provide transaction processing and asset safekeeping and servicing to the clients of those businesses 
on february   the board of directors of the company declared a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable march  to stockholders of record on march  all share numbers shown in this report reflect shares outstanding prior to the two for one stock split 
the company s current largest client  eaton vance  accounted for  and of the company s net operating revenues for the years ended december   and respectively 
the company believes its relationship with eaton vance is good and expects it to continue 
the company s agreements with mutual funds managed by eaton vance  pursuant to which the company provides custody and fund accounting services  extend through august and continue thereafter until terminated by either party upon sixty days prior notice 
the company derives its revenues from financial asset administration services and private banking transactions 
although interest income and non interest income are reported separately for financial statement presentation purposes  the company s clients view the pricing of the company s asset administration and banking service offerings on a bundled basis 
in establishing a fee structure for a specific client  management analyzes all expected revenue and related expenses  as opposed to separately analyzing fee income and interest income and related expenses for each from such relationship 
accordingly  management believes net operating revenue net interest income plus non interest income and net income are the most meaningful measures of financial results 
revenue generated from asset administration and other fees and interest income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  non interest income consists primarily of fees for financial asset administration and is principally derived from custody  multicurrency accounting  transfer agency and administration services for financial asset managers and the assets they control 
the company s clients pay fees based on the volume of assets under custody  the number of securities held and portfolio transactions  income collected and whether other value added services such as foreign exchange  securities lending and performance measurement are needed 
asset based fees are usually charged on a sliding scale 
as such  when the assets in a portfolio under custody grow as a result of changes in market values or cash inflows  the company s fees may be a smaller percentage of those assets 
fees for individually managed accounts  such as custodial  trust and portfolio accounting services for individuals  investment advisors  private trustees  financial planners  other banks and fiduciaries  and other institutions are also included in non interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income generated from interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest bearing liabilities are generated by the company s clients who  in the course of their financial asset management  generate cash balances  which they deposit on a short term basis with the company 
the company invests these cash balances and remits a portion of the earnings on these investments to its clients 
the company s share of earnings from these investments is viewed as part of the total package of compensation paid to the company from its clients for performing asset administration services 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k may contain statements  which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements in this k include certain statements regarding capital ratios  liquidity and the company s year project 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s future results may be subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s planned increase in capital ratios is dependent upon growth in retained earnings  which earnings are subject to the risks set forth herein 
in addition  the company s liquidity is dependent  in part  upon the continued availability of current borrowing facilities  the loss of which may impair the company s access to liquid funds 
because certain fees charged by the company for its services are based on the market values of assets processed  such fees and the company s quarterly and annual operating results are sensitive to changes in interest rates  declines in stock market values  and investors seeking alternatives to the investment offerings of the company s clients 
also  the company s interest related services  along with the market value of the company s investments  may be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates or changes in the relationship between certain index rates 
in addition  many of the company s client engagements are  and in the future are likely to continue to be  terminable upon days notice 
the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of those rights could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition the year issue discussed below may affect the company s operations 
the company s successful completion of its year project is subject to the risks set forth under year issue  year readiness disclosure below 
the segment of the financial services industry in which the company is engaged is extremely competitive 
certain current and potential competitors of the company are more established and benefit from greater market recognition and have substantially greater financial  development and marketing resources than the company 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the timing of the commencement or termination of client engagements  the rate of net inflows and outflows of investor funds in the debt and equity based investment vehicles offered by the company s clients  the introduction and market acceptance of new services by the company and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
because the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  any unanticipated shortfall in revenues in a specified period may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations for that period 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
year issue year readiness disclosure the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company relies heavily on its internal computer systems to process transactions and conduct services for clients 
in addition  the company relies on automated data communications with vendors  clients and other third parties  as well as certain third party hardware and software providers such as electronic data systems 
the company also relies on other third party relationships in the conduct of its business 
for example  third party vendors handle the payroll function for the company  and the company also relies on the services of the landlords of its facilities  telecommunication companies  utilities and commercial airlines  among others 
any failure of the company s internal computer systems  third party data communications  third party hardware and software providers or other third party vendors due to the year issue could have material adverse impact on the company s ability to provide timely and accurate services to its clients 
as a result  any such failure could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in late the company  with the assistance of an outside consultant  completed a detailed assessment of the company s year compliance status 
as part of the assessment process  the company also developed project plans for application renovation and testing 
based on this assessment  the company determined that it would be required to modify or upgrade portions of its software so that its computer systems would properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications to  or upgrades of  existing software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and upgrades are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and clients to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
the company s total year project cost and estimates to complete include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of a third party s year issue  and are based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted 
any failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has utilized both internal and external resources to modify or upgrade existing software and to test such software for year compliance 
the company plans to complete the year project  including all internal testing  by the second quarter of the company has completed compliance testing of its flagship applications  significantly completed compliance testing on all other applications and started integration testing of internal applications 
the company began testing with clients in the fourth quarter of and will be substantially completed by the third quarter of the company believes that testing with business partners and third party vendors  including such entities as the depository trust company  will be substantially completed by the third quarter of the company expects to complete its remediation contingency plan in the first quarter of to address any failure by the company or any third party with which the company interacts to properly and or completely renovate software code and or computer systems for the year issue 
the company s plans will address contingencies for i failure to complete successfully renovation  validation or implementation of systems and ii failure of systems at critical dates before or after january  the company has budgeted up to an additional  for year costs that may arise during  which consist primarily of internal staffing costs  along with some outside consultants 
these costs may include  but are not limited to  completing testing with third parties that are not year compliant and software renovation necessitated by internal and or third party testing 
these amounts are not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
through december   the company had incurred and expensed approximately  related to the assessment of  and remediation efforts in connection with  its year project and the development of a remediation plan 
all amounts expensed and to be expensed in connection with the year issue will be funded through operating cash flows 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications  testing and contingency plans are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  availability of and cooperation by clients  vendors and other third parties  the compatibility of third party interfaces  and similar uncertainties

in addition  the company uses the investment portfolio to secure open positions at securities clearing institutions in connection with its custody services 
the portfolio is comprised of securities of state and political subdivisions  mortgage backed securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or freddie mac  and federal agency callable bonds issued by fhlmc and the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb  municipal securities  corporate debt securities  and foreign government bonds issued by the canadian provinces of ontario and manitoba 
the company invests in mortgage backed securities  federal agency callable bonds and corporate debt to increase the total return of the investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and prepayment risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty is unable to meet the terms of the contract 
prepayment risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates may cause mortgage securities to be paid off prior to their maturity dates 
federal agency callable bonds generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and call risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that the federal agency issuing the bonds may be unable to meet the terms of the bond 
call risk results from the possibility that fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in the exercise of the call option by the federal agency 
credit risk related to mortgage backed securities and federal agency callable bonds is substantially reduced by payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
the company invests in municipal securities to generate stable  tax advantaged income 
municipal securities generally have lower stated yields than federal agency and us treasury securities  but the after tax yields are comparable 
municipal securities are subject to credit risk 
the company invests in foreign government bonds in order to generate foreign source income to maximize the use of the foreign tax credit 
the foreign government bonds are denominated in us dollars to avoid foreign currency risk 
these bonds are subject to credit risk 
the book value and weighted average yield of the company s securities held to maturity at december   by effective maturity  are reflected in the following table 
weighted average book value yield dollars in thousands due within one year due from one to five years  due after five years up to ten years  due after ten years  total securities held to maturity  the book value and weighted average yield of the company s securities available for sale at december   by effective maturity  are reflected in the following table 
weighted average book value yield dollars in thousands due from one to five years  due after five years up to ten years  due after ten years  total securities available for sale  loan portfolio the following table summarizes the company s loan portfolio for the dates indicated october december  dollars in thousands loans to individuals       loans to not for profit organizations  loans to mutual funds     less allowance for loan losses net loans       floating rate       fixed rate virtually all loans to individually managed account customers are written on a demand basis  bear variable interest rates tied to the prime rate and are fully secured by liquid collateral  primarily freely tradable securities held in custody by the company for the borrower 
the unsecured lines of credit may  in the event of a default  be collateralized at the company s option by securities held in custody by the company for those mutual funds 
loans to mutual funds also include advances by the company to certain mutual fund clients pursuant to the terms of the custody agreements between the company and those clients 
at december   the company s only lending concentrations which exceeded of total loans were the revolving lines of credit to mutual fund clients discussed above 
these loans were made in the ordinary course of business on the same terms and conditions prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
the company s credit loss experience has been excellent 
there have been no loan chargeoffs or adverse credit actions in the history of the company 
it is the company s policy to place a loan on non accrual status when either principal or interest becomes days past due and the loan s collateral is not sufficient to cover both principal and accrued interest 
as of december   there were no past due loans  troubled debt restructurings  or any loans on non accrual status 
although virtually all of the company s loans are fully collateralized with freely tradable securities  management recognizes some credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and has recorded an allowance for loan losses of  at december  this amount is not allocated to any particular loan  but is intended to absorb any risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
management actively monitors the loan portfolio and the underlying collateral and regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
interest rate sensitivity the company  like all financial intermediaries  is subject to interest rate risk 
rapid changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the company by causing changes in the market value of the company s assets and its net interest income 
interest rate risk arises when an earning asset matures or when its rate of interest changes in a time frame different from that of the supporting interest bearing liability 
by seeking to minimize the difference between the amount of earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that could change interest rates in the same time frame  the company attempts to reduce the risk of significant adverse effects on net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
the company does not attempt to match each earning asset with a specific interest bearing liability 
instead  as shown in the table below  it aggregates all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to determine the difference between these in specific time frames 
this difference is known as the rate sensitivity gap 
a positive gap indicates that more earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature in a time frame  and a negative gap indicates the opposite 
maintaining a balanced position will reduce risk associated with interest rate changes  but it will not guarantee a stable interest rate spread because the various rates within a time frame may change by differing amounts and change in different directions 
the company seeks to manage interest rate risk by investment portfolio actions designed to address the interest rate sensitivity of asset cash flows in relation to liability cash flows 
portfolio actions used to manage interest rate risk include managing the effective duration of the portfolio securities and utilizing interest rate floors and interest rate swaps 
interest rate contracts are used to hedge against large rate swings and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
interest rate contracts involve elements of credit and market risk which are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such instruments are entered into for hedging as opposed to investment or speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company periodically monitors the financial stability of its counterparties according to prudent investment guidelines and established procedures 
there can be no assurance that such portfolio actions will adequately limit interest rate risk 
the following table presents the repricing schedule for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  within three six one three to six to twelve year to over five months months months five years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities       loans fixed rate loans variable rate   total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities demand deposit accounts   savings accounts   interest rate contracts     short term borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities      net interest sensitivity gap during the period       cumulative gap      interest sensitive assets as a percent of interest sensitive liabilities cumulative interest sensitive assets as a percent of total assets cumulative net interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets cumulative gap as a percent of total assets adjustable rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid 
mortgage backed securities are included in the pricing category that corresponds with their effective maturity 
market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
the company s board of directors reviews  on a quarterly basis  the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital of various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
in the normal course of business  the financial position of the company is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risks associated with interest rate movements 
the company regularly assesses these risks and has established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
the company recognizes that effective management of interest rate risk includes an understanding of when adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the statement of income and comprehensive income 
accordingly  the company will manage its position so that it monitors its exposure to net interest income over both a one year planning horizon and a longer term strategic horizon 
in order to manage this interest rate risk  the company has established that it will follow a policy limit stating that projected net interest income over the next months will not be reduced by more than given a change in interest rates of up to basis points or over months 
the bank s primary tool in managing interest rate risk in this manner is an income simulation model wherein the company projects the future net interest income derived from the most current projected balance sheet using a variety of interest rates scenarios 
the model seeks to adjust for cashflow changes arising from the changing interest rates for mortgage prepayments  callable securities and adjustable rate securities 
the company also utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage interest risk 
interest rate contracts involve an agreement with a counterparty to exchange cash flows based on an underlying interest rate index 
the effect of these agreements was to lengthen short term variable rate liabilities into longer term fixed rate liabilities 
the results of the sensitivity analysis as of december  and december   indicated that given an upward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in a reduction in projected net interest income of and respectively  versus the policy limit of 
conversely  a downward shift of basis points would result in an increase in projected net interest income of and respectively 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yield and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
assumptions are the underlying factors that drive the interest rate risk measurement system which include interest rate forecasts  client liability funding  mortgage prepayment assumptions and portfolio yields 
the model assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period will change periodically over the period being measured 
the model also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the model provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the results of this modeling are monitored by management and presented to the board of directors  quarterly 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of an institution to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
for a financial institution such as the company  these obligations arise from the withdrawals of deposits and the payment of operating expenses 
the company s primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  new deposits  short term borrowings  interest payments on securities held to maturity and available for sale  fees collected from asset administration clients  and the capital raised from the sale of the capital securities 
asset liquidity is also provided by managing the duration of the investment portfolio 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funds  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to meet its depositors needs  to satisfy its operating requirements and to fund the payment of an anticipated annual cash dividend of approximately 
per share 
the company s ability to pay dividends on the common stock may depend on the receipt of dividends from investors bank trust company 
in addition  the company may not pay dividends on its common stock if it is in default under certain agreements entered into in connection with the sale of the capital securities 
any dividend payments by investors bank trust company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the massachusetts commissioner of banks 
subject to regulatory requirements  the company expects to pay to an annual dividend to its stockholders  currently estimated to be in an amount equal to 
per share of outstanding common stock approximately  based upon  shares outstanding as of december  
at december  and  cash and cash equivalents were of total assets 
at december   approximately million or of total assets mature within a one year period 
the company has informal borrowing arrangements with various counterparties whereby each counterparty has agreed to make funds available to the company at the federal funds overnight rate 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements as of december  was million 
each bank may terminate its arrangement at any time and is under no contractual obligation to provide requested funding to the company 
the company s borrowings under these arrangements are typically on an overnight basis 
the company believes that if these banks were unable to provide funding as described above  a satisfactory alternative source of funding would be available to the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that such funding will be available 
lack of availability of liquid funds could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the company also has master repurchase agreements in place with various counterparties whereby each broker has agreed to make funds available to the company at various rates in exchange for collateral consisting of marketable securities 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements at december  was billion 
the company also has a borrowing arrangement with the federal home loan bank of boston the fhlbb whereby the company may borrow amounts determined by prescribed collateral levels and the amount of fhlbb stock held by the company 
the minimum amount of fhlbb stock held by the company is required to i of its outstanding residential mortgage loan principal including mortgage pool securities  ii of total assets  iii total advances from the fhlbb  divided by a leverage factor of if the company borrows under this arrangement  the company is required to hold fhlbb stock equal to of such outstanding advances 
the aggregate amount of borrowing available to the company under this arrangement at december  was million 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  net cash used for investing activities  consisting primarily of purchases of investment securities  proceeds from maturities of investment securities  and purchases of acquisitions was  for the year ended december  net cash used for financing activities  consisting primarily of net activity in deposits  was  for the year ended december  capital resources historically  the company has financed its operations principally through internally generated cash flows 
the company incurs capital expenditures for furniture  fixtures and miscellaneous equipment needs 
the company leases microcomputers through operating leases 
such capital expenditures have been incurred and such leases entered into on an as required basis  primarily to meet the growing operating needs of the company 
as a result  the company s capital expenditures were   and  for the years ended december   and respectively 
stockholders equity at december  was  an increase of  or  from  at december  the ratio of stockholders equity to assets increased to at december  from at december  the federal reserve board has adopted a system using internationally consistent risk based capital adequacy guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
under the risk based capital guidelines  different categories of assets are assigned different risk weights  based generally upon the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
certain off balance sheet items  which previously were not expressly considered in capital adequacy computations  are added to the risk weighted asset base by converting them to a balance sheet equivalent and assigning them the appropriate risk weight 
federal reserve board and fdic guidelines require that banking organizations have a minimum ratio of total capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of 
total capital is defined as the sum of tier i and tier ii capital elements  with at least half of the total capital required to be tier i 
tier i capital includes  with certain restrictions  the sum of common stockholders equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  less certain intangible assets 
tier ii capital includes  with certain limitations  subordinated debt meeting certain requirements  intermediate term preferred stock  certain hybrid capital instruments  certain forms of perpetual preferred stock  as well as maturing capital instruments and general allowances for loan losses

the leverage ratio is defined to be a company s tier i capital divided by its adjusted total assets 
the leverage ratio adopted by the federal banking agencies requires a ratio of tier i capital to adjusted average total assets for top rated banking institutions 
all other banking institutions are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of to 
the computation of the risk based capital ratios and the leverage ratio requires the capital of the company to be reduced by most intangible assets 
the company s leverage ratio at december  was  which is in excess of regulatory minimums 
the bank s leverage ratio at december  was  which is also in excess of regulatory minimums
