item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company was organized in november to invest in a diversified portfolio of multifamily  commercial and residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and other real estate related assets in the us and us markets 
the company expects to generate income for distribution to its stockholders primarily from the net earnings derived from its investments in real estate related assets 
the company intends to operate in a manner that permits it to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
in march  the company received million of net proceeds from the initial public offering of  shares and the private placement of  shares of its common stock  which the company used to acquire its initial portfolio of investments 
the company commenced operations on march the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
dollar amounts are expressed in thousands  other than per share amounts 
market conditions market conditions were highly variable and unpredictable during the company s first full quarter of operations ending in june was a period of relative calm in the financial markets 
interest rates and credit spreads remained relatively stable during that period  and the outlook for the global economy appeared strong  with some uncertainty about economic conditions in the far east 
during that period  the company faced increasing competition from finance companies  brokerage firms and other reits in its core strategy of acquiring and originating high yield loans and securities backed by commercial real estate or commercial real estate mortgages 
nevertheless  the company was able to acquire approximately  in subordinated commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and  in non core liquid securities by the end of its first full quarter of operations 
spurred by russia s technical default on its debt in august and deterioration in the economic situation in the far east  market conditions during the third quarter of worsened and investor concerns over creditworthiness became paramount 
credit spreads widened dramatically and yields on us treasury securities fell  as investors sold off holdings of credit sensitive securities in favor of treasuries 
these factors combined to cause a significant decline in the market value of the company s investment portfolio 
the company s holdings of subordinated cmbs were particularly affected  inasmuch as they represent the first classes in a securitization transaction to be affected by credit losses 
the unrealized gain loss on the company s holdings of subordinated cmbs declined from  at june  to  at september  the fourth quarter of saw continued spread widening in the credit sensitive sectors of the debt markets and reduced liquidity in the financing markets 
as traditional sources of real estate funding sought to protect their liquidity  financing for new real estate construction was curtailed significantly 
in october  in response to market upheaval and volatility  the company sold approximately  of its holdings of non core liquid securities in order to reduce its leverage and enhance its liquidity position  resulting in a realized loss of approximately  after termination of the related hedges 
by late november and during the month of december  market conditions had stabilized considerably but credit spreads remained at or near historically wide levels 
mixed signals pervaded the us economic outlook  but there was consistent evidence of a trend toward slower growth 
as a result of market conditions  the value of the company s investment portfolio continued to decline during the fourth quarter 
the unrealized loss on the company s holdings of subordinated cmbs increased from  at september  to  at december  however  real estate credit fundamentals remained solid and the company believes there has been no discernible change in the credit quality of its portfolio 
the company s earnings depend  in part  on the relationship between long term interest rates and short term interest rates 
the company s investments bear interest at fixed rates determined by reference to the yields of medium or long term us treasury securities or at adjustable rates determined by reference with a lag to the yields on various short term instruments 
the company s borrowings bear interest at rates that have historically moved in close relationship to the london interbank offered rate libor 
to the extent that interest rates on the company s borrowings increase without an offsetting increase in the interest rates earned on the company s investments  the company s earnings could be negatively affected 
from march   the date the company commenced operations  to december   one month libor declined from to and the yield on ten year us treasury notes declined from to 
the decline in libor during the period had a beneficial impact on the company s financing costs 
the decline in the ten year us treasury yield  a change that would normally increase the value of the company s portfolio of fixed income securities  was more than offset by a significant widening of credit spreads during the period  causing the value of the company s portfolio to decline 
during the first quarter of  the ten year us treasury yield increased from its december  level 
the company expects that this increase in interest rates will cause the value of the company s portfolio at march  to be less than its value at december  recent events on march   the company declared distributions to its stockholders of per share  payable on april  to stockholders of record on march  the company also set may  as the date for its annual stockholders meeting and march  as the record date for stockholders that will be eligible to participate and vote at the stockholders meeting 
during the first quarter of  the company applied a portion of its cash on hand to fund approximately  of its commitment outstanding to originate a  floating rate commercial real estate construction loan secured by a second mortgage see note to the accompanying financial statements 
the company intends to fund the remaining portion of the commitment through a combination of existing cash on hand  new equity  additional borrowings and or syndication of a portion of the commitment 
during the first quarter of  the company issued  shares of common stock under its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan and received total proceeds of  which were used for general corporate purposes 
on march   the company s board of directors approved the grant of options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock to certain officers and employees of the company pursuant to the company s stock option plan 
the exercise price of these options is the greater of the company s gaap net asset value per share or the closing price of the company s common stock on march  funds from operations ffo most industry analysts  including the company  consider ffo an appropriate supplementary measure of operating performance of a reit 
in general  ffo adjusts net income for non cash charges such as depreciation  certain amortization expenses and gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property 
however  ffo does not represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the results of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit established new guidelines clarifying its definition of ffo and requested that reits adopt this new definition beginning in the company computes ffo in accordance with the definition recommended by nareit 
the company believes that the exclusion from ffo of gains or losses from sales of property was not intended to address gains or losses from sales of securities as it applies to the company 
accordingly  the company includes gains or losses from sales of securities in its calculation of ffo 
the company s ffo for the period march  through december  was  which was the same as its reported gaap net loss for the period 
the company reported cash flows used in operating activities of  cash flows used in investing activities of  and cash flows provided by financing activities of  in its statement of cash flows for the period march  through december  results of operations net loss for the period march  through december  was  or per share basic and diluted 
interest income the following table sets forth information regarding the total amount of income from interest earning assets and the resultant average yields 
information is based on daily average balances during the period 
for the period march  through december  interest average annualized income balance yield securities available for sale   commercial mortgage loan   securities held for trading   cash and cash equivalents  total   interest income on securities held for trading includes interest earned on deposits with brokers as collateral for securities sold short 
the company sold a substantial portion of its portfolio of securities available for sale during the fourth quarter of and  as a result  the amount of the company s interest income for future periods may be significantly less than the amounts reported above 
interest expense the following table sets forth information regarding the total amount of interest expense from short term borrowings including the net amount paid under the company s interest rate swap agreement allocated pro rata to each category of short term borrowings and securities sold short  and the resultant average yields 
information is based on daily average balances during the period 
for the period march  through december  interest average annualized expense balance yield reverse repurchase agreements   line of credit borrowings   securities sold short   total   the company repaid a substantial portion of its borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements during the fourth quarter of and  as a result  the amount of the company s interest expense for future periods may be significantly less than the amounts reported above 
net interest margin from operating portfolio the company considers its operating portfolio to consist of its securities available for sale  its commercial mortgage loan and its cash and cash equivalents because these assets relate to its core strategy of acquiring and originating high yield loans and securities backed by commercial real estate  while at the same time maintaining a portfolio of liquid investment grade securities to enhance the company s liquidity 
the company considers its short term trading strategies to be distinct from its operating portfolio 
net interest margin from the operating portfolio is annualized net interest income from the portfolio divided by the average daily balance of interest earning assets in the portfolio 
net interest income from the operating portfolio is total interest income from the portfolio less interest expense including the net amount payable under the interest rate swap agreement relating to short term borrowings secured by investments in the operating portfolio 
for the period march  to december   total interest income from the operating portfolio was  and total related interest expense was  resulting in net interest income of  and net interest margin of from the operating portfolio for the period 
other expenses expenses other than interest expense consist primarily of management fees and general and administrative expenses 
management fees of  for the period march  through december  were comprised solely of the base management fee paid to the manager for the period as provided pursuant to the management agreement between the manager and the company  as the manager earned no incentive fee for such period 
other expenses of for the period march  through december  were comprised of accounting agent fees  custodial agent fees  directors fees  fees for professional services  insurance premiums and other miscellaneous expenses 
other gains losses the loss on sale of securities available for sale of  for the period march  to december  consisted of a loss of  on the sale of securities available for sale and  of associated termination costs on an interest rate swap transaction 
the loss on securities held for trading of for the period march  to december  consisted primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on us treasury and agency securities  forward commitments to purchase or sell agency rmbs  and financial futures contracts 
the foreign currency gain of for the period march  through december  relates to the company s net investment in a commercial mortgage loan denominated in pounds sterling 
distributions declared on june   the company declared distributions to its stockholders totaling  or per share 
these distributions were paid on july  to stockholders of record on june  on september   the company declared distributions to its stockholders totaling  or per share 
these distributions were paid on october  to stockholders of record on september  distributions paid in represented approximately of the company s undistributed tax basis net income for the period march  through december  on december   the company declared distributions to its stockholders totaling  or per share 
these distributions were paid on january  to stockholders of record on january  on march   the company declared distributions to its stockholders of per share  payable on april  to stockholders of record on march  for federal income tax purposes  the distributions paid on july  and october  are expected to be taxable as ordinary income to the company s stockholders in and the distributions paid on january  and payable on april  are expected to be taxable as ordinary income to the company s stockholders in tax basis net income and gaap net loss net income as calculated for tax purposes tax basis net income was  or per share basic and diluted  for the period march  through december   compared to a net loss as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap of  or per share basic and diluted  for the period march  through december  differences between tax basis net income and gaap net loss arise for various reasons 
for example  realized net losses on securities available for sale  which are included in income for gaap purposes  are not deductible from tax basis income  but are carried forward as tax basis capital losses that are available to offset future tax basis capital gains 
in computing income from its subordinated cmbs for gaap purposes  the company takes into account estimated credit losses on the underlying loans whereas for tax basis income purposes  only actual credit losses are taken into account 
certain general and administrative expenses may differ due to differing treatment of the deductibility of such expenses for tax basis income 
unrealized net gains on securities available for trading  which are included in income for gaap purposes  are included in tax basis income only when realized 
in addition  loan commitment fees are recognized over the life of the related loan for gaap purposes but are included in tax basis income upon receipt 
also  differences could arise in the treatment of premium and discount amortization on the company s securities available for sale 
a reconciliation of gaap net loss to tax basis net income is as follows for the period march through december  gaap net loss  net losses on securities available for sale  subordinate cmbs income differentials  general and administrative expense differences unrealized net gains on securities held for trading income from loan commitment fees other tax basis net income  changes in financial condition securities available for sale at december   an aggregate of  in unrealized losses on securities available for sale was included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
the company s securities available for sale  which are carried at estimated fair value  included the following at december  estimated fair security description value percentage commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs non investment grade rated subordinated securities  non rated subordinated securities  total cmbs  single family residential mortgage backed securities rmbs agency adjustable rate securities  agency fixed rate securities  privately issued investment grade rated fixed rate securities  total rmbs  agency insured project loan  total securities available for sale  during  the company sold a substantial portion of its securities available for sale for total proceeds of  resulting in a realized loss of 
substantially all of the sales occurred during the fourth quarter of as part of the company s efforts to reduce its leverage and enhance its liquidity in response to reduced liquidity in the financing markets and spread widening in the credit sensitive sectors of the debt markets 
the proceeds from these sales were applied primarily to reduce amounts borrowed under the company s reverse repurchase agreements and to increase its cash position 
short term borrowings to date  the company s debt has consisted of line of credit borrowings and reverse repurchase agreements  which have been collateralized by a pledge of most of the company s securities available for sale  securities held for trading and its commercial mortgage loan 
the company s financial flexibility is affected by its ability to renew or replace on a continuous basis its maturing short term borrowings 
to date  the company has obtained short term financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with the company s financing objectives 
under the line of credit and the reverse repurchase agreements  the respective lender retains the right to mark the underlying collateral to market value 
a reduction in the value of its pledged assets will require the company to provide additional collateral or fund margin calls 
from time to time  the company expects that it will be required to provide such additional collateral or fund margin calls 
the following table sets forth information regarding the company s short term borrowings 
for the period march  through december  average maximum range of balance balance maturities reverse repurchase agreements   to days line of credit borrowings   to days total   to days the company repaid a substantial portion of its borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements during the fourth quarter of hedging instruments the company has entered into forward currency exchange contracts pursuant to which it has agreed to exchange pound  pounds sterling for  us dollars on march  in certain circumstances  the company may be required to provide collateral to secure its obligations under the forward currency exchange contracts  or may be entitled to receive collateral from the counterparty to the forward currency exchange contracts 
at december   no collateral was required under the forward currency exchange contracts 
the estimated fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts was a liability of at december   which was recognized as a reduction of net foreign currency gains 
during  the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction that was  for accounting purposes  designated as being intended to modify the interest rate characteristics of certain of the company s securities available for sale from fixed to variable rate 
in connection with the sale of a portion of the company s portfolio of securities available for sale  the swap transaction  which had a notional amount of  was terminated later in the year at a loss of 
the company monitored the swap to ensure that it remained effective through the date of its termination 
the portion of the loss associated with securities available for sale sold by the company during   is included in the loss on sale of securities available for sale in the statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
the remaining portion of the loss   which is associated with certain of the company s remaining securities available for sale  was added to the cost basis of such securities and is being amortized as a yield adjustment over the previously scheduled term of the swap transaction  which was ten years 
capital resources and liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the company s ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  loan acquisition and lending activities and for other general business purposes 
the primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of short term borrowings  principal and interest payments on and maturities of securities available for sale  securities held for trading and the commercial mortgage loan  and proceeds from sales thereof 
the company s operating activities used cash flows of  during the period march  through december  during the foregoing period  cash flows from operating activities were used primarily to purchase securities held for trading 
the company s investing activities used cash flows totaling  during the period march  through december  during the foregoing period  cash was used in investing activities primarily to purchase investments 
the company s financing activities provided  during the period march  through december  and consisted primarily of net short term borrowings and net proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock 
although the company s portfolio of securities available for sale was acquired at a net discount to the face amount of such securities  the company has received to date and expects to continue to receive sufficient coupon income in cash from its portfolio to fund distributions to stockholders as necessary to maintain its reit status 
the company is subject to various covenants in its existing line of credit  including maintaining a minimum gaap net worth of  and a debt to equity ratio not to exceed to  as well as a covenant that after september  the company s gaap net worth will not decline by more than percent over any two consecutive fiscal quarters 
at december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the company is currently negotiating additional financing facilities to increase financing flexibility and provide capital to fund future growth 
there is no assurance that such negotiations will be concluded successfully 
the company s ability to execute its business strategy depends to a significant degree on its ability to obtain additional capital 
factors which could affect the company s access to the capital markets  or the costs of such capital  include changes in interest rates  general economic conditions and perception in the capital markets of the company s business  covenants under the company s current and future credit facilities  results of operations  leverage  financial conditions and business prospects 
current conditions in the capital markets for reits such as the company have made permanent financing transactions difficult and more expensive than at the time of the company s initial public offering 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively fund future growth 
except as discussed herein  management is not aware of any other trends  events  commitments or uncertainties that may have a significant effect on liquidity 
reit status the company intends to elect to be taxed as a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  with respect thereto 
accordingly  the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to stockholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
the company may  however  be subject to tax at corporate rates on net income or capital gains not distributed 
investment company act the company intends to conduct its business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act 
under the investment company act  a non exempt entity that is an investment company is required to register with the securities and exchange commission sec and is subject to extensive  restrictive and potentially adverse regulation relating to  among other things  operating methods  management  capital structure  dividends and transactions with affiliates 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation by the staff of the sec  to qualify for this exemption  the company  among other things  must maintain at least of its assets in qualifying interests 
pursuant to such sec staff interpretations  certain of the company s interests in agency pass through and mortgage backed securities and agency insured project loans are qualifying interests 
in general  the company will acquire subordinated interests in commercial mortgage backed securities subordinated cmbs only when such mortgage securities are collateralized by pools of first mortgage loans  when the company can monitor the performance of the underlying mortgage loans through loan management and servicing rights  and when the company has appropriate workout foreclosure rights with respect to the underlying mortgage loans 
when such arrangements exist  the company believes that the related subordinated cmbs constitute qualifying interests for purposes of the investment company act 
therefore  the company believes that it should not be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act as long as it continues to invest primarily in such subordinated cmbs and or in other qualifying interests 
however  if the sec or its staff were to take a different position with respect to whether the company s subordinated cmbs constitute qualifying interests  the company could be required to modify its business plan so that either i it would not be required to register as an investment company or ii it would comply with the investment company act and be able to register as an investment company 
in such event  i modification of the company s business plan so that it would not be required to register as an investment company would likely entail a disposition of a significant portion of the company s subordinated cmbs or the acquisition of significant additional assets  such as agency pass through and mortgage backed securities  which are qualifying interests or ii modification of the company s business plan to register as an investment company would result in significantly increased operating expenses and would likely entail significantly reducing the company s indebtedness including the possible prepayment of the company s short term borrowings  which could also require it to sell a significant portion of its assets 
no assurances can be given that any such dispositions or acquisitions of assets  or deleveraging  could be accomplished on favorable terms 
consequently  any such modification of the company s business plan could have a material adverse effect on the company 
further  if it were established that the company were an unregistered investment company  there would be a risk that the company would be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the sec  that the company would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties and that third parties could seek to obtain recission of transactions undertaken during the period it was established that the company was an unregistered investment company 
any such results would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
year readiness disclosure the company is currently in the process of evaluating its information technology infrastructure and other systems for year compliance

for its internal systems  the manager established a plan to test systems for year compliance  remediate such systems where necessary  and validate its remediation efforts to confirm year compliance 
with respect to products and services provided by third parties  the manager established a plan to learn from the third parties whether their products and services are year compliant and upgrade to year compliant products and services where necessary 
in addition  the manager will develop contingency plans for all mission critical systems 
finally  the manager and the company will participate in industry wide year testing of its systems where available and appropriate 
the manager has advised the company that  as of december   it has completed the testing  remediation and validation of its internal systems for year compliance 
the manager has advised the company that it has communicated with substantially all of the manager s and the company s suppliers of products and services to determine their year compliance status and the extent to which the manager or the company could be affected by any supplier s year compliance issues 
the manager has received responses from substantially all such suppliers with respect to their year compliance 
some suppliers have indicated that an upgrade of their products or services will be necessary in order to make such products or services year compliant 
the manager expects to complete such upgrades for critical third party software by june  and for the remaining third party software by september  despite assurances from such suppliers  however  there can be no assurance that the products and services of such suppliers  who are beyond the company s control  will be year compliant 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
the manager has advised the company that it expects to incur costs of up to to complete the evaluation and modification of its systems as may be necessary to achieve year compliance 
the company may be required to bear a portion of the costs incurred by the manager in this regard 
approximately has been expended by the manager as of december  there can be no assurance that the costs will not exceed the amount referred to above 
the manager has advised the company that it is in the process of preparing a contingency plan for the possible year failure of its mission critical systems or suppliers 
the manager expects to complete the contingency plan by march  and to implement the contingency plan over the course of several months in mid in addition to the contingency plan  the manager has informed the company that it intends to develop a plan for checking its critical systems during the first two days of the year to determine whether such systems will continue to operate on monday  january  when business resumes 
there can be no assurance that such a plan or the manager s contingency plan will be successful in preventing a disruption of the company s operations 
the manager has advised the company that it does not anticipate any material disruption in the operations of the company as a result of any failure by the manager to achieve year compliance 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not experience a disruption in operations caused by year problems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk and credit curve risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
credit curve risk is highly sensitive to dynamics of the markets for commercial mortgage securities and other loans and securities held by the company 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the market value of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate securities valued based on a market credit spread to us treasuries 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the market value of the company s portfolio may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is decreased  the market value of the company s portfolio may increase 
changes in the market value of the company s portfolio may affect the company s net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading or indirectly through their impact on the company s ability to borrow 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain of the company s securities and the company s ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in addition  changes in the general level of the libor money market rates can affect the company s net interest income 
the majority of the company s liabilities are floating rate based on a market spread to us libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and  indeed  that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses or increased costs 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  the company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which the company trades may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render the company unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if the company anticipates that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income test purposes  the company may conduct part or all of its hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following tables quantify the potential changes in the company s net portfolio value and net interest income under various interest rate and credit spread scenarios 
net portfolio value is defined as the value of interest earning assets net of the value of interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using an assumption that interest rates  as defined by the us treasury yield curve  increase or decrease basis points and the assumption that the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
net interest income in this set of scenarios is calculated using the assumption that the us libor curve remains constant 
net interest income is defined as interest income earned from interest earning assets net of the interest expense incurred by the interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the us libor curve  increase or decrease by basis points and the assumption that the yield curve of the libor rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
market value in this scenario is calculated using the assumption that the us treasury yield curve remains constant 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the respective values calculated in the scenario labeled as base case 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in portfolio net market value given us treasury yield curve movements change in projected change in treasury yield curve  portfolio basis points net market value base case projected percentage change in portfolio net market value given credit spread movements change in projected change in credit spreads  portfolio basis points net market value base case projected percentage change in portfolio net interest income given libor movements projected change in change in libor  portfolio basis points net interest income base case asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing and or maturing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match the term of the company s liabilities as closely as possible with the expected holding period of the company s assets 
this is less important for those assets in the company s portfolio considered liquid as there is a very stable market for the financing of these securities 
the company uses interest rate duration as its primary measure of interest rate risk 
this metric  expressed when considering any existing leverage  allows the company s management to approximate changes in the net market value of the company s portfolio given potential changes in the us treasury yield curve 
interest rate duration considers both assets and liabilities 
as of december   the company s duration on equity was approximately years 
this implies that a parallel shift of the us treasury yield curve of basis points would cause the company s net asset value to increase or decrease by approximately 
because the company s assets  and their markets  have other  more complex sensitivities to interest rates  the company s management believes that this metric represents a good approximation of the change in portfolio net market value in response to changes in interest rates  though actual performance may vary due to changes in prepayments  credit spreads and the cost of increased market volatility 
other methods for evaluating interest rate risk  such as interest rate sensitivity gap defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period  are used but are considered of lesser significance in the daily management of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets pay a fixed coupon and the income from such assets are relatively unaffected by interest rate changes 
the majority of the company s liabilities are borrowings under its line of credit or reverse repurchase agreements that bear interest at variable rates that reset monthly 
given this relationship between assets and liabilities  the company s interest rate sensitivity gap is highly negative 
this implies that a period of falling short term interest rates will tend to increase the company s net interest income while a period of rising short term interest rates will tend to reduce the company s net interest income 
management considers this relationship when reviewing the company s hedging strategies 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect the company s net interest income positively or negatively even if the company were to be perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the company currently has positions in forward currency exchange contracts to hedge currency exposure in connection with its commercial mortgage loan denominated in pounds sterling 
the purpose of the company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the company from the risk that the eventual us dollar net cash inflows from the commercial mortgage loan will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company s current strategy is to roll these contracts from time to time to hedge the expected cash flows from the loan 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are not expected to have a material impact on the company s net portfolio value or net interest income
