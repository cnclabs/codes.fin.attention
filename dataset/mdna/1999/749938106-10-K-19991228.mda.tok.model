it requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be charged to expense as incurred 
sop is required to be adopted for the company s fiscal year ending september  the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
year readiness disclosure the year problem arises as a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
in other words  date sensitive software  including those with embedded microprocessors  may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system and equipment failures or malfunctions causing disruptions of operations  including among others  a temporary inability to process calls  transactions and information  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s internal systems 
the company has evaluated its infrastructure as it relates to information technology and has developed a plan to ensure its year compliance 
this plan includes  among other things  replacing certain systems with new internally developed year compliant systems and upgrading the remaining software systems to be year compliant 
year compliant upgrades to the company s predictive dialing equipment have been installed in all call centers 
these processes allow the company to receive lead information  make and receive calls  and produce reports on compliant and non compliant date formats 
modification and testing of all information and non information systems was completed at the end of november the company has replaced all non compliant personal computer workstations 
the company is also in the process of evaluating its security systems  copiers and other non information technology infrastructure in which non compliant software or embedded microprocessors might exist 
the company believes that all material components in this infrastructure will be year compliant by the end of the calendar year 
readiness of third parties 
the company has been advised by its third party vendors and clients of their year readiness and the extent to which their inability to be year compliant will affect the company 
this process has included identifying vendors and defining the readiness of their products and services 
the company s primary focus as it relates to vendors is on those that support the teleservices platform and information technology platforms  followed by all others 
the company has completed its efforts to gather vendor compliance documentation 
the company s software has been modified to accept two digit year or four digit century inputs  and will be capable of creating output in either format as required by the client 
accordingly  the company is prepared for either occurrence and does not believe that it will be adversely affected by its customers readiness 
cost of year compliance 
the company has incurred minimal costs to date in addressing the year issue 
the year evaluation  modification and testing that has been undertaken to date has not had a material effect on the company s ability to deliver reports and other output on a timely basis 
the company currently expects that the total costs to become year compliant will not exceed  hardware costs to date have been approximately  software costs are projected to be approximately  and consulting and testing costs are projected to be approximately  new capital equipment  which the company required  was either purchased or financed under the company s new operating lease line 
the remaining costs will be financed out of operating working capital 
risks associated with the year the extent of the company s year exposure  and the costs of achieving year compliance are based on management s knowledge to date and its best estimates 
the company is not aware  at this time  of any internal or third party vendor year non compliance that will not be corrected by the end of december and that will materially affect the company 
however  these estimates were derived using numerous assumptions  and some risks that the company faces include the failure of internal information systems  the failure of third parties to provide services  such as electricity and telecommunication services  and a slow down in clients ability to make payments 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel  the ability to identify and correct all year impacted areas  the ability of third party vendors and clients to be year compliant and other similar uncertainties 
contingency plans 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  other than the loss of telecommunications and power  is loss of the dialers  which will prevent the company from generating revenue 
it is reasonable to assume that some interruptions related to specific campaigns and applications may result 
the company has developed contingency plans to minimize any potential risk of year issues  including alternative power sources and redundancy in operational capabilities
