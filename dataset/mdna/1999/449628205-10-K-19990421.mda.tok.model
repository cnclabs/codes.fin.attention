new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
year compliance in july  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb issued eitf  accounting for the costs associated with modifying computer software for the year  which requires that costs associated with modifying computer software for the year be expensed as incurred 
the company is in the process of conducting a comprehensive review of its systems  equipment  product and services  suppliers  customers and building facilities to identify its exposure to any adverse impact of year non compliance 
the company has implemented or will implement procedures that it deems necessary to safeguard the company from computer related issues associated with adverse effects as a result of improperly recognizing the millennial date change 
based upon its review and efforts to date  the company believes that future external and internal costs to be incurred for the modification of internal use software to address year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
the company believes  based upon its review and efforts to date  that external and internal remediation costs to be incurred for the modification of internal use software to address year issues will not be material 
these cost estimates include the costs of external contractors  non capitalizable purchases of software and hardware  and the direct cost of internal employees working on year projects 
the company s cost estimate does not include the cost of implementing contingency plans  which are in the process of being developed  and also does not include any potential litigation or warranty costs related to year issues if the company s remediation efforts are not successful 
the company has undertaken a program to alert its suppliers and dealers of year issues 
based on its contacts with suppliers and dealers  the company believes that a majority of our most important suppliers are year compliant  and the company anticipates that most of its dealers will be year compliant by mid the company will continue to work with its remaining suppliers and its dealers throughout to secure year compliance by december  based on third party representations and internal testing  and subject to the company s ongoing compliance efforts  the costs and uncertainties relating to timely resolution of year issues applicable to the company s business and operations are not reasonably expected by the company to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
for those suppliers and dealers that have not adequately responded to our year concerns  we are following up to ultimately achieve an acceptable level of compliance within our supply chain 
as there can be no assurance that an acceptable level of year compliance will be achieved  the company is in the process of developing contingency plans to address potential issues 
based upon the company s review and efforts to date  the company currently anticipates completion of critical year compliance issues by mid  and the company plans to continue integration testing throughout the balance of if the company s year compliance efforts  as well as the efforts of the company s suppliers and dealers  individually and in the aggregate  are not successful  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
factors that could cause actual results to differ include unanticipated supplier or dealer failures  disruption of utilities  transportation or telecommunications breakdowns  foreign or domestic governmental failures  as well as unanticipated failures on our part to address year related issues 
the company s most reasonably likely worst case scenario in light of these risks would involve a potential loss in sales resulting from order  production and shipping delays throughout the company s supply chain caused by year related disruptions 
the degree of sales loss impact would depend on the severity of the disruption  the time required to correct it  whether the sales loss was temporary or permanent  and the degree to which our primary competitors were also impacted by the disruption 
the company is in the process of developing year contingency plans that will be designed to mitigate the impact on the company if its year compliance efforts are not successful 
the targeted completion date for the company s contingency planning is mid the company s contingency plans may include the use of alternative systems and non computerized approaches to our business including manual procedures for machine operation  collecting and reporting of its business information  as well as alternative sources of supply 
at this time  the company has not determined whether it will be necessary to stockpile inventory or supplies as part of its contingency planning 
the information included in this year section represents forward looking statements and involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
the company has evaluated the impact of the year issue on the business and does not expect to incur significant costs with year compliance 
the company believes that all software and hardware requirements to enable it to cope with year issue have been or are being currently implemented 
however  there can be no assurance that unanticipated costs may arise in implementing these requirements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about foreign currency risk substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from foreign operations 
as such  its income is significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and by currency controls 
most of the countries where the company operates such as hungary and several african countries do not have freely convertible currencies and their currencies have been subject to devaluations in recent years 
in particular  during  the income from the company s hungarian  african and israeli subsidiaries was significantly reduced by losses arising from foreign exchange transactions due to significant currency devaluations against the us dollar 
the hungarian currency  which floats against a basket of two currencies the us dollar and the european currency unit underwent devaluations against the us dollar at the rate of during since the beginning of  the hungarian currency has been further devalued by approximately against the us dollar 
since the functional currency for investor is the forint  these devaluations have resulted in certain currency translation adjustments directly impacting stockholders equity 
furthermore  certain of african countries such as zambia and uganda operate in hyper inflationary economies  and 
the israeli shekel devalued against the us dollar in  even though the devaluation was modest in previous years 
see notes a and i of notes to consolidated financial statements filed under item of this report 
derivative financial instruments are utilized by the company to reduce foreign exchange risk and price risk relating to its heavy equipment distribution and agricultural commodity business 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
israel tractor enters into foreign currency forward contracts and call option contracts to reduce the impact of fluctuations of certain currencies against the us dollar 
gains and losses resulting from such transactions are reflected in the results of operations 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements resulting primarily from nondollar denominated trade receivables and the israeli tax effects of dollar denominated trade purchases 
at december   israel tractor had foreign currency forward contracts  with notional values of million  to purchase and sell israeli shekels 
all of the contracts matured in january current pricing models were used to estimate the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts  and call options 
the counterparties to these contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks or other financial institutions  which are recognized market makers 
disclosure about interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing  and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
