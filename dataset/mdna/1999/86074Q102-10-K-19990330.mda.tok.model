item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in selected financial and operating data 
production the company mines  processes and refines palladium  platinum  and associated metals from the j m reef in montana 
the company conducts its mining operations at the stillwater mine  and recently announced its expansion plan intended to reach an annualized rate of pgm production of million ounces before year end the company plans to expand existing operations at the stillwater mine and develop the east boulder site 
see business and properties expansion plan 
the company s production of palladium and platinum is determined by the tons of ore mined  the mill head grade ounces of precious metal per ton of mined ore and metallurgical recovery 
the company defines its mine production as those ounces contained in concentrate when it is shipped to the company s smelter  which generally occurs within four days of the ore being mined 
the company records revenue when partially refined ounces are shipped from its base metals refinery to a third party refiner for final processing 
shipment from the base metals refinery to a third party refiner generally occurs within to days of mining 
approximately days elapse between the time ore is extracted from the stillwater mine and the time ounces of precious metal contained in that ore are made available to the company by a third party refiner 
because of the length of the processing cycle and the different cutoff points for identifying production and sales  production may not always correspond to sales in a particular accounting period 
however  any production not shipped from the base metals refinery at the end of an accounting period is generally shipped during the first two weeks of the subsequent period 
in  the company commenced a major expansion project designed to double ore throughput at its nye  montana operation to  tons of ore per day 
this expansion effort was completed in mid  and during the fourth quarter of that year  the company successfully attained its  tons of ore per day goal 
increases in ore tonnage in and were achieved by the company as a result of the operation of the new foot shaft and the underground crusher and conveyor system 
also  the company added manpower  increased the number of active stopes and improved productivity  principally through the increase of mechanized mining methods 
the ore grade of the company s reserves is generally consistent  but  as is common in an underground mine  the grade mined and the recovery rate achieved will vary from period to period 
in particular  mill head grade can be expected to vary by up to from quarter to quarter 
during  the average mill head grade of ore processed was ounce of pgms per ton of ore 
during  the average mill head grade of ore processed was ounce of pgms per ton of ore  compared to the average mill head grade of ounce of pgms per ton of ore 
revenue the company s revenue and earnings are significantly influenced by worldwide prices of palladium and platinum  which can be volatile and over which the company has no control 
sales to significant customers represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company sells its metals to a small number of customers and brokers  however  the company may  if the need were to arise  readily sell its metal in markets throughout the world 
until the second quarter of  the company used basic hedging techniques involving spot deferred forward contract commitments and put and call options to attempt to lock in prices for its production  benefit from price increases and protect against price decreases 
during the first quarter of the company entered into significant hedge positions  particularly for palladium  for and these hedging contracts  which expired in precluded the company from obtaining the benefit of increased market palladium prices in and as a result  the company s revenues were unfavorably impacted  in with the company s combined average realized price for palladium falling about below the combined average market price 
these below market hedge contracts matured and the metal was delivered by the close of the objective of the company s hedging policy in the future will be to benefit from upward price movements while providing floor prices to reduce the company s exposure to downside price movements 
pursuant to this policy  the company entered into sales contracts to sell approximately to of its palladium production and of its platinum production from through palladium sales under these contracts will be at a slight discount to market prices 
these contracts provide for an average floor price of approximately per ounce on substantially all of the company s annual production and an average maximum price of per ounce on approximately of production 
the of the company s platinum production covered by these contracts will be sold at a slight discount to market prices  subject to floor of per ounce and a cap of per ounce 
see risk factors dependence on agreements with significant customers 
cost structure the company s current operating costs per ounce have improved significantly as a result of increased production at the stillwater mine 
cash costs of production include cash costs of mining  processing  general and administrative expenses at the minesite  royalties and taxes other than income taxes and are net of byproduct metals revenue 
mine site general and administrative expenses include overhead  taxes other than income  and royalties 
operating efficiencies were achieved through economies of scale as production increased 
in addition  material handling and material processing efficiencies were realized once the underground shaft was commissioned in june  as the shaft provided a more automated method for transporting ore and waste underground 
finally  the successful implementation of controls to minimize mine dilution also had a favorable impact on the company s cost structure 
management expects these operating efficiencies will continue to be realized in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  pgm production 
total ore tons mined in the year ended december  increased to  tons  from  tons for the year ended december  tons milled in averaged about  tons of ore per day compared with an average of  tons of ore per day milled in increases in ore tonnage were achieved as a result of the mine expansion  primarily through operating efficiencies gained by commencing underground ore crushing  adding mine manpower and improving stoping productivity 
enhanced stoping productivity was driven by an increase in mechanized mining to almost of tons mined  up from in the average head grade of ore delivered to the mill was ounces per ton in  compared to ounce per ton achieved in metallurgical recovery was in  compared to in and is the result of the use of additional flotation cells installed to increase retention time in flotation 
palladium and platinum production increased to  ounces for the year ended december  from  ounces in once again  this substantial improvement in production was primarily the result of the mine expansion and  more specifically  was driven by the increase in tons milled during  coupled with an improvement in the recovery rate resulting from the installation of three additional flotation cells earlier in the year 
revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared with million in  an increase of and were the result of higher production levels and higher realized pgm prices 
palladium sales increased to  ounces in from  ounces in platinum sales increased to  ounces in from  ounces in total sales of metal increased to  ounces in from  ounces in  primarily due to significantly higher production levels achieved in the combined average realized price per ounce of palladium and platinum sold in was per ounce  compared to per ounce in  while the combined average market price rose about to per ounce in  compared with per ounce in the company was unable to realize the average market price for palladium in because of its inability to defer delivery upon favorable terms on its market deferred palladium forward contracts due to continued severe backwardation in the palladium markets during and the average realized price per ounce of platinum sold was per ounce in  a decline of compared with per ounce in the platinum market price was per ounce in compared to per ounce in the average realized price per ounce of palladium was per ounce in compared to per ounce for  while the average market price increased to per ounce in from per ounce in costs and expenses 
cash production costs per ounce in the year ended december  decreased  or  to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december   primarily the result of a increase in metal production 
total production costs per ounce in the year ended december  decreased  or to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december  this decrease is also primarily due to increased metal production 
operating income loss 
the company reported operating income of million for the year ended december   compared with an operating loss of million for the higher operating income was mainly the result of increased metal production and higher realized prices 
for  general and administrative costs were million compared with million in net income loss 
primarily as a result of increased operating income  the company has provided for income taxes of million compared to a reported benefit of million for the year ended december  as a result the company reports net income of million for the year ended december  compared with net loss of million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  pgm production 
total ore tons mined in the year ended december  increased to  tons from  tons for the year ended december  tons milled in averaged about  tons of ore per day compared with an average of  tons of ore per day milled in increases in ore tonnage were achieved as a result of the mine expansion  primarily through operating efficiencies gained by commencing underground ore crushing  adding mine manpower and improving stoping productivity 
enhanced stoping productivity was driven by an increase in mechanized mining to almost of tons mined  up from in the average head grade of ore delivered to the mill was ounce per ton in  an increase over the ounce per ton achieved in the mill head grade increased primarily due to successful implementation of controls to minimize mining dilution 
additionally  commissioning of the production shaft in june produced greater efficiencies in material handling and subsequent material processing through the mill 
palladium and platinum production increased to  ounces for the year ended december  from  ounces in once again  this substantial improvement in production was primarily the result of the mine expansion and  more specifically  was driven by the increase in tons milled during and a higher average mill head grade  coupled with an improvement in the recovery rate resulting from the installation of three additional flotation cells earlier in the year 
revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared with million in  an increase of 
palladium sales increased to  ounces in from  ounces in platinum sales increased to  ounces in from  ounces in total sales of metal increased to  ounces in from  ounces in  primarily due to significantly higher production levels achieved in as a result of the mine expansion 
effective january   the company changed its method of revenue recognition whereby revenue is recognized when product is shipped from the company s base metals refinery to an external refiner 
this change made the company s revenue recognition policy more comparable with other precious metals producers 
the cumulative effect of this change as of january  was to increase revenue by approximately million in the first quarter of  the effect on net income was not material 
the combined average realized price per ounce of palladium and platinum sold in was per ounce  roughly the same as  while the combined average spot price rose about to per ounce in  compared with per ounce in the average realized price per ounce of palladium remained constant at per ounce for both and  while the average spot price increased to per ounce in from per ounce in the average realized price per ounce of platinum sold was per ounce in  a decline of compared with per ounce in the platinum spot price remained about the same in both years at per ounce 
the company was unable to realize the average spot price for palladium in because of its inability to defer delivery upon favorable terms on its spot deferred palladium forward contracts due to continued severe backwardation in the palladium markets during costs and expenses 
cash costs per ounce of metal produced in the year ended december  decreased to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december   primarily the result of a increase in metal production 
total costs per ounce of metal produced in the year ended december  decreased to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december  this decrease is also primarily due to increased metal production 
operating income loss 
the company incurred an operating loss of million for the year ended december   compared with an operating loss of million for the higher operating loss was mainly the result of a million increase in general and administrative costs 
for  general and administrative costs were million compared with million in the million of expenses for included approximately million of non recurring severance costs and professional fees related to changes in the company s business processes and management structure and the reorganization of the company s board of directors 
the decrease in costs per ounce for the current year was driven by significantly higher production in  about more than in operating efficiencies also contributed to the lower cost per ounce 
net income loss 
the company realized a net loss of million for the year compared with net income of million in  when results included the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
absent this accounting change  the net loss for was million 
the larger net loss in was driven by lower realized platinum prices  reduced interest income on lower cash balances and increased net interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million compared with cash used in operations of million in  an increase of million 
the increase is a result of increased net income of million and an increase in the provision for deferred income taxes of million in as compared to a total of million of cash was used in investing activities in compared to million in the increased usage was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures as a result of the development of the east boulder project and the stillwater mine expansion 
for the year ended december   cash flow from financing activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the completion in the fourth quarter of of million common share offering which provided approximately million 
as a result of the above  cash and cash equivalents increased by million for the year ended december   compared with a decrease of million in the comparable period of in september  the company completed the sale leaseback of a tunnel boring machine and miscellaneous other mining equipment 
the leases are classified as operating leases for financial reporting purposes and are non cancellable with terms of seven years 
the annual rental payments during the term of the leases are approximately million 
in  the company announced plans to expand the stillwater mine and to develop east boulder 
total capital to fund the expansion is expected to approximate million 
of this  the stillwater mine expansion is expected to cost about million  east boulder is expected to cost approximately million  and approximately million is designated for the expansion of the company s smelter and base metals refinery located in columbus  montana 
during  the company expects to invest approximately million on capital items  including capitalized interest of million 
cash flow from operating activities is not expected to be sufficient to cover capital expenditures 
based on cash and short term investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations  along with existing credit facilities of million  management believes there is sufficient liquidity to meet operating and capital needs 
the company may  from time to time  also seek to raise additional capital from the public or private securities markets or from other sources for general corporate purposes and for investments beyond the scope of the current phase of its current expansion plans 
the company has obtained a seven year million credit facility from a syndicate of banks led by the bank of nova scotia 
the facility provides for a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
borrowings may be made under the term loan facility until december  and amortization of the term loan facility will commence on march  the final maturity of the term loan facility and revolving credit facility will be december  the loans will be required to be prepaid from excess cash flow  proceeds from asset sales and the issuance of debt or equity securities  subject to specified exceptions 
proceeds of the term loan facility will be used to finance a portion of the expansion plan 
proceeds of the revolving credit facility will be used for general corporate and working capital needs 
at the company s option  the scotiabank credit facility will bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  in each case plus a margin 
the interest rate may be adjusted depending upon the company s ratio of debt to operating cash flow 
substantially all the property and assets of the company and its subsidiaries and the stock of the company s subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the scotiabank credit facility 
conditions precedent to both initial and subsequent borrowing under the term loan facility and revolving credit term loan facility and revolving credit facility include continued performance of the marketing contracts  receipt of satisfactory milestone reports regarding the expansion plan  and receipt of all government and third party approvals necessary or advisable for the expansion plan 
covenants in the scotiabank credit facility restrict additional indebtedness  payment of dividends or redemption of capital stock  liens  investment  acquisitions  dispositions or mergers  transactions with affiliates  capital expenditures other than those associated with the expansion plan  refinancing or prepayment of subordinated debt excluding an underwritten call or conversion of the company s convertible subordinated notes due  changes in the nature of business conducted or ceasing operations at the principal operating properties  and commodities hedging to no more than of annual palladium production and of annual platinum production excluding the sales covered by the company s marketing contracts and similar agreements 
the company also is subject to financial covenants including a debt to operating cash flow ratio  is debt service coverage ratio and a debt to equity ratio 
events of default include a cross default to other indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries  any material modification to the life of mine plan for the stillwater mine  a change of control of the company  the failure to maintain annual palladium production of at least  ounces in the year and at least  ounces each year thereafter or any breach or modification of any of the sales contracts 
default under the scotiabank credit facility may constitute a default under the indenture associated with the convertible notes 
the indenture for the convertible notes also contains standard covenants and provisions for events of default 
in addition  the company had an unsecured working capital line of credit with n m rothschild sons limited  with a maximum borrowing capacity of million 
as of december   there were no borrowings against this credit line  and the company could borrow up to million based upon quarterly borrowing calculations under the terms of the agreement 
this facility was cancelled concurrent with completion of the scotiabank credit facility 
market risk the company may from time to time utilize derivative instruments to financial risk 
the company has no material derivative position as of december  during the third quarter of  the company entered into sales contracts with general motors corporation  ford motor company  mitsubishi corporation and kemet corp 
these contracts cover the company s pgm production over the five year period from january through december during this period  the company has committed between to of its actual palladium production and approximately of its planned annual platinum production 
palladium and platinum sales are priced at a slight discount to market  with floor prices on substantially all of the company s production committed under these contracts averaging per ounce of palladium and per ounce of platinum 
the company has also agreed to an average maximum price of approximately per ounce on approximately of its palladium production and per ounce on approximately of its planned annual platinum production 
environmental obligations the company focused on one significant environmental project during this project involved securing an amendment to the company s existing permit from the montana department of environmental quality which provided for a substantial increase in throughput at the stillwater mine site and construction of a tailings facility on a tract of land owned by the company in stillwater county  montana 
the costs associated with this permitting effort were million in and million in the company does not expect to incur additional costs in connection with the project 
the company does not anticipate incurring any significant capital or unusual operating expenditures for other environmental compliance within the next months 
in the first quarter of  an environmental group filed a complaint against the montana department of environmental quality challenging the adequacy of the environmental impact statement and reclamation provisions developed in connection with the permit amendment 
the company believes the complaint is without merit 
in  the company s environmental expenses were million and capital expenditures for environmental equipment were million 
the company incurred million in environmental related costs during  of which half were expensed and half were for purchases of environmental equipment 
the company s ongoing operating expenditures for environmental compliance are expected to be approximately million per year 
the company is presently required to post surety bonds with the state of montana in the amount of million  which also represents the company s best estimate of mine closure and reclamation costs for current operations 
the company does not believe that costs will materially exceed this estimate 
the company is accruing for reclamation costs over the life of the stillwater mine based on current production levels and estimated proven and probable reserves 
on december  and  the accrued liability was million 
the company periodically reviews the adequacy of its reclamation and mine closure obligations in light of current laws and regulations and will adjust its estimate as necessary 
year issues year will impact computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any programs with time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operation  including a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in other ordinary activities 
this problem largely affects software programs written years ago  before the issue came to prominence 
the company primarily uses third party software programs written and updated by outside firms  and the company is in the process of determining whether this software is year compliant 
in may  the company began the implementation of a new information technology infrastructure that the company believes will be fully year compliant 
this infrastructure will be in place by the fourth quarter of the company does not believe that the costs associated with additional year compliance will be material 
the company has set in motion an effort to obtain written assurances from its material suppliers regarding their year compliance 
as a result of this effort  the company expects to generate by the second quarter of a validated list of suppliers that are year compliant  and will use the entities on this list to obtain its supplies 
the company has also begun the process of obtaining written assurances from the company s material customers regarding their year compliance 
the company s goal is to obtain by the second quarter of written assurances from customers that they are year compliant or that they are expecting to become year compliant before december  in addition  the company is developing contingency plans to deal with potential year risks that could occur as a result of power failures or the failure of other critical systems 
although the company has taken significant steps to address the year problem  there can be no assurance that the failure of the company and or its material customers or suppliers to timely attain year compliance will not materially reduce the company s revenues or income  or that these failures and or the impacts of broader compliance failures by telephone  mail  data transfer or other utility or general service providers or government or private entities will not have a material adverse effect on the company
