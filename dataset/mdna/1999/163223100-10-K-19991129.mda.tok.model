year the year issue arises because many computerized systems use two digits  rather than four  to identify a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or some other date  resulting in errors when information using year dates is processed 
in addition  similar problems may arise in some systems  which use certain dates in to represent something other than a date 
the effects of the year issue may be experienced before  on  or after january   and if not addressed  the impact on operations and financial reporting may range from minor errors to significant systems failure  which could affect an entity s ability to conduct normal business operations 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
for this purpose the term computer equipment and software includes systems that are commonly thought of as information technology it systems 
non it systems refers to other miscellaneous systems  not thought of as it systems  such as alarm systems and fax machines 
in addition  the company has been determining the extent to which the systems of third parties with whom the company has significant relationships may be vulnerable to year issues and what impact  if any  these year issues will have on the company 
as part of these assessments  a compliance plan  which included the formation of a steering committee and a timetable for identifying  evaluating  resolving and testing its year issues  was developed 
the timetable provided for the company s completion of its remediation of any year issues by the end of september this target has been met 
while it is difficult  at present  to fully quantify the overall cost of this work  the company has incurred less than  in spending for year issues 
costs for systems maintenance and modification are expensed as incurred while spending for new hardware  software or equipment has been capitalized and will be depreciated over the assets useful lives 
the company has funded its year expenditures out of its cash flows from operations
