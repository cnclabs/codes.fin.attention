fiscal total net revenue total net revenue for fiscal year decreased to  compared to  for fiscal year this overall decrease in the company s total net revenue is attributable to the downturn in the worldwide semiconductor industry  which resulted in a significant slowdown in the construction or expansion of semiconductor fabs 
the total net revenue decline occurred primarily in the factory automation systems and tool automation systems segments  which declined by and in fiscal  respectively 
while product and equipment revenue decreased  the company gained market share in fiscal and experienced a increase in its service and maintenance revenue 
net export sales to customers outside of north america were  or of revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year

excluding these charges  fiscal year gross profit margins would have been 
the decline in gross profit margin in fiscal year occurred principally in the factory automation systems segment which decreased to from 
the deterioration in margin was the result of fixed capacity and related manufacturing costs  which could not be reduced proportionally with the reduction in production volume  and a decline in product pricing during the industry downturn 
this decline was partially offset by favorable changes in product mix 
gross margins for service and maintenance increased in fiscal year to from in fiscal and was primarily related to increased growth in software maintenance contracts 
research and development research and development expenses increased slightly to  or approximately of total net revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the dollar amount of research and development spending reflects the company s continued investment in new product development and enhancements of existing product lines

acquired in process research and development on october  the company acquired interval logic corporation ilc  a california corporation  for aggregate consideration of  shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company issued or assumed options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock 
ilc was formed in to develop advanced  high performance planning and scheduling software solutions for the semiconductor industry 
the value of the transaction was  including approximately  of expenses related to the acquisition 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
at the time of the acquisition  the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of ilc 
management is aware that it is responsible for estimating the fair value of purchased in process research and development 
the value assigned to the intangible assets  primarily the acquired technology  was based on the fair market value using a risk adjusted discounted cash flow approach 
ilc s sole product at the time of the acquisition was the leverage tm product  which was under development 
ilc had no product revenues during its prior existence and was a development stage enterprise 
the total development effort was estimated to take approximately engineering man months at a cost of approximately  the project included completion of the software requirement definition  data integration  and validation  completion of the graphics user interface  development of alpha and beta versions for customer testing  and integration and adaptation with customer systems 
the significant further investments in development required to meet expected customer requirements were substantially completed in the third quarter of fiscal year the actual development costs have approximated the cost estimates used in the valuation model 
the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition 
the company defines technological feasibility as the point at which a working model is functioning to designed specification and has been placed at a beta test site 
the leverage product was first released to a beta test site in march in addition  the technology had no alternative future use to the company in other research and development projects or otherwise 
accordingly  the acquired technology was expensed as in process research and development

the company believes that existing cash and investment balances and funds available under its existing revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements which are not historical facts but which are forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
the words expect  anticipate  internal  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the company s expected shipment levels and profitability and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements may be forward looking statements 
this report also contains other forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
many of such factors are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in response to new information or future events or otherwise 
important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
the company s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical  with recurring periods of over supply 
this recurring over supply often has had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s capital expenditures and  consequently  on demand for products manufactured and marketed by the company 
the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry has materially adversely affected the company s business  and could continue to do so in the future 
the company believes that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will be subject to similar fluctuations 
also  the recent high rate of technical innovation and resulting improvements in the performance and price of semiconductor devices  which have driven much of the demand for the company s products  could slow  or encounter limits  in the future 
in addition  any other factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties posed generally by the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the effects of the continued downturn throughout the industry  the company faces the following risks and uncertainties continuation of the semiconductor industry downturn and expense reduction measures the company might take in response could interfere with the company s product development efforts and jeopardize its ability to respond rapidly to an industry recovery  the company s restructuring costs have adversely affected its financial position  the lengthy sales cycle for the company s products makes it difficult to anticipate sales  the company s operating results fluctuate significantly and are affected by the high price and relatively small number of systems it sells  variations in its gross margins  and its significant fixed costs  the company depends on a limited number of customers  the company s future revenue sources are uncertain  changes in the economies of foreign countries in which the company operates could have an adverse effect on the company s business  the company has invested heavily in mm wafer technology  which is being adopted more slowly than the company expected  the company needs employees who  because of competition for their skills and experience  may be difficult to hire and retain  the company may have difficulty managing growth in light of fluctuating demand  the company s recent acquisitions may disrupt its operations  acquisitions may dilute the equity interests of the company s stockholders and reduce the company s liquidity  the company s international operations create special risks and uncertainties over which the company has substantially less control than those relating to its domestic operations  the company faces significant competition from other automation companies  the company must continually improve its technology to remain competitive  the company may experience delays in product development and technical difficulties  the company depends on one or a few suppliers for some materials  the company may be unable to protect its proprietary technology  claims by others that the company infringes their proprietary technology could harm the company s business  the company uses small quantities of toxic and hazardous substances that could expose it to liability  the company depends on mordechai weisler  its chairman  and mitchell g 
tyson  its president and chief executive officer  year problems may disrupt the company s operations  the market price of the company s common stock is volatile  future sales of the company s common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of the company s common stock  and certain provisions of the company s charter and by laws and massachusetts law make a takeover of the company more difficult 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in its future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
the statement requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  with the instruments measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value  gains or losses  depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
the statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
by fiscal  in accordance with sfas no 
 which deferred the effective date of sfas no 
the company is evaluating sfas no 
to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements 
year general many computer systems and software products are expected to experience problems handling dates beyond the year because the systems are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code fields 
inability of the company s products  or of products and systems on which the company relies  to process these dates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company has implemented a company wide year project the project with the objective of minimizing the impact of year issues on its products  services  infrastructure  and internal business support applications 
the project s goals are to ensure year readiness and compliance for i all of the company s products  ii all business systems that are used by the company  and iii all critical business services or products provided to the company by its vendors 
the project is now complete and the company is year ready 
in addition  we have prepared contingency plans to monitor and react to unforeseen issues from our suppliers 
project the company has implemented a plan to ensure that all of the company s processes and systems have been assessed  tested and made year compliant 
the company engaged the services of an information technology consulting firm to assist in the program management of the project  and has created a project team which includes representatives from each of the company s divisions and locations worldwide 
the project has addressed the impact of year on company products  internal information technology it systems  internal non it systems  and systems and products of the company s suppliers and other third parties 
the steps in completing the project were to identify software systems and products that pose potential year issues  assess the year readiness of each item identified  develop and implement programs that will achieve year compliance  test to verify compliance  and develop contingency plans as required 
at december   the project is in various stages of progress as discussed below pri products the company has completed all of the testing and verification portion of the project for all of its current products 
new products not yet released to customers are being designed and tested to achieve year readiness prior to the company s sale of these products 
the company does not foresee any issues with year compliance of its products 
internal it systems the company has assessed its internal it systems  including business information systems  systems utilized in its manufacturing and service operations  and systems providing electronic interfaces between the company and its customers  to determine whether the company s operations will be interrupted by year issues 
the company has completed testing and verifying year compliance of its internal it systems 
the company does not foresee any issues with its year compliance of internal it systems 
internal non it systems internal non it systems include telecommunications systems  security systems  hvac systems and utilities 
testing and verification of these systems are complete 
the company does not foresee any year issues in this area 
supply chain the company has worked with suppliers and other third parties upon which it is dependent to determine the extent of their year compliance 
the company s inquiry and assessment of their year readiness is complete and it does not foresee any year issues with its supply chain 
however  we have also developed contingency plans to monitor and react to any unforeseen issues from our suppliers 
costs based on its investigation to date  the company does not expect the total cost of its year project to have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial results 
the estimated total cost of the year project is approximately  the total amount charged to expense through september  was approximately  the remaining amounts are expected to be spent in early fiscal risk the project is intended to reduce the company s risk of experiencing significant year problems 
based on the progress that the company has made to date in addressing its year issues  and its plan and timetable to complete the project  the company does not anticipate significant interruption of normal operations 
the risk posed by year issues depends substantially on the number and type of any instances of non compliance that have not yet been discovered by the company 
to the extent that the company s internal systems  or products and services obtained from third parties  are found not to be year compliant  the company could face disruptions in its business which could  in turn  cause delays in meeting production and shipping goals and could divert significant management resources 
to minimize potential disruptions  the company has implemented a contingency plan to address any unresolved issues affecting year compliance  if needed 
the company s contingency plan identifies potential issues and contingency actions to be taken in case of year non readiness 
the contingency plan addresses actions such as disaster recovery  emergency notification systems  employee staffing  suitability of alternate suppliers  and critical data backups in the key areas of manufacturing and services  supply chain management  marketing  sales and customer support  facilities  finance  legal and human resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and exchange rate risk a portion of the company s business is conducted outside the united states through its foreign subsidiaries 
the company has foreign currency exposure related to its operations in international markets  where certain business is transacted in foreign currencies and accordingly is subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  changes in currency exchange rates may impact the translation of foreign statements of operations into us dollars  which may in turn affect the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company s functional currency is the us dollar for all of its subsidiaries  and therefore  translation gains and losses are included as a component of net income or loss 
substantially all of the company s revenues are invoiced and collected in us dollars 
the company has entered into forward contracts in canadian dollars to hedge the expected operating expenses of its canadian subsidiary that are denominated in canadian dollars 
these contracts are used to mitigate the company s risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying cost exposures 
these contracts  for which the contract periods do not exceed sixteen months  expire in december and are not expected to be renewed as part of the company s risk management strategies 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts  which did not qualify for hedge accounting  are classified in other income  net 
at september  the notional amount of outstanding forward currency contracts for canadian dollars was  which was marked to market and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in canadian currency exchange rates at september   would be  the potential loss was estimated calculating the fair value of the forward exchange contracts at september   and comparing that with the value calculated using the hypothetical forward currency exchange rates
