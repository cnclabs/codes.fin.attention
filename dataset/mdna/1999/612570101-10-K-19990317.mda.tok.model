the financial results reported herein do not indicate the financial results that may be achieved by the company in any future period 
background monterey pasta company was incorporated in june as a producer and wholesaler of refrigerated gourmet pasta and sauces to restaurants and grocery stores in the monterey  california area 
the company has since expanded its operations to provide its products to grocery and club stores throughout the united states 
the company s overall strategic plan is to enhance the value of the monterey pasta company brand name by distributing its gourmet pasta products through multiple channels of distribution 
the company s distribution of pasta and pasta sauces to grocery and club stores increased from approximately stores as of december  to approximately  by december  declined to approximately  as of december  and increased  once again  to approximately  stores by december  during  and  significant costs were incurred to promote the expansion that occurred  including product demonstration  advertising  warehousing  and distribution costs and the hiring of additional personnel 
in  the focus was changed to developing a profitable distribution base 
hence  the reduction in store totals  and the return to profitability 
during the company added profitable retail and club distribution and expects to continue that trend in the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue will depend on three key factors whether grocery and club store chains will continue to increase the number of their stores offering the company s products  whether the company can continue to increase the number of grocery and club store chains offering its products  and continued introduction of new products that meet consumer acceptance 
grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores  and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future or that such chains will not reduce the number of stores carrying the company s products 
the company believes that access to substantially greater capital resources  coupled with continued reduction of its administrative and production costs as a percent of sales revenue  will be key requirements in the company s efforts to enhance its competitive position and increase its market penetration 
in order to support its expansion program  the company has developed  and is continuing to develop new products for consumers and revised advertising and promotional activities for its retail grocery and club store accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its net revenues from grocery and club stores 
because the company will continue to make expenditures associated with the expansion of its business  the company s results of operations may be affected 
continuing operations for  and net revenues from continuing operations were   and  for  and  respectively  reflecting an annual decrease in sales of for  when compared to  and a increase for when compared to the decline in sales in reflected the elimination of unprofitable chains and direct store delivery accounts 
the increase resulted from an increased number of stores to approximately  individual grocery and club stores by year end of  compared to approximately  at year end the gross margin increase from in to in was due mainly to reduced sales discounts and allowances through better controls and elimination of unprofitable accounts 
gross margin stabilized at in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  down  or in from  in the expense level reflects a two year decline of  from the level  or a decrease 
included in s spending was over million specifically for sales and marketing  including incremental headcount and promotional expenses deemed necessary  at that time  to expand the business base 
additionally  selling costs were high as a result of the company s efforts to obtain new customers and enter new geographic markets 
the increases were also attributable to expansion of the company s infrastructure  including increased administrative and management salaries  recruiting and training  and facilities costs 
this trend was reversed in as a result of redefined marketing focus  and facilities consolidation from san francisco to salinas  with reduced headcount and related overhead expenses implemented in late and early further decreases in administrative costs continued during with a million reduction in professional fees  public reporting expense  insurance costs  and other administrative expenses  partially offset by increased expenses in the sales and marketing area related to new customers and stores 
management believes the current level of sg a expenses is consistent with efficient operations  and additional expenses in future periods  mainly in the sales and marketing area  will be directly associated with increased levels of sales 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  or of net revenues in  compared to  or of net revenues in  and  or in these increases over the past two years relate primarily to capital expenditures in the salinas  california production facility 
the company anticipates further increases in depreciation and amortization in future periods as additional equipment is purchased and placed in service 
net interest expense of  was recognized in compared to net interest expense of  in and  in which included  for guaranteed discount on convertible debt 
cash raised by the march  private placement helped reduce interest expense in the increase was the result of the funds borrowed to repurchase common stock from clearwater fund iv llc in march 
results of discontinued operations for net revenues from discontinued operations for were  prior to the sale of former subsidiary upscale food outlets  ufo 
operating losses from discontinued operations were  for prior to sale of ufo 
the losses from business disposition and phaseout were charged directly to the reserves established during  as were other expenditures related to the restaurant and franchising operations 
during  the reserves were also reduced by  to reflect adjustments of estimates to the actual company expenditures 
remaining reserves of  at the end of  less a recovery of  were utilized during liquidity and capital resources during the twelve months ended december    of cash was provided by the company s operations  compared to  used in the improvement in related to an increase in net cash income net income plus depreciation and amortization from continuing operations of  and an improvement in working capital accounts  specifically accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in inventory 
in december  the company obtained a  credit facility from a commercial lending institution 
the proceeds from such financing were used for sales and marketing expenses  working capital  and capital investment 
this facility was renegotiated with another bank in july to avail the company of lower interest rates 
it was increased to  in march  to allow for a stock repurchase of  shares of common from clearwater fund iv llc for a total purchase price of  or per share  resulting in a reduction in shares outstanding 
in july the credit facility was renewed for another year with lower interest rates on the term note and the receivables and inventory line  as well as no loan fees see note to the financial statements 
a total of  in cash was used in in connection with the stock repurchase referred to above  including costs associated with the transaction 
in addition   in cash was used to purchase property  equipment  and intangible assets in  compared to  in the company plans to make additional capital expenditures in to expand production capability and improve packaging efficiency by adding a new pack line 
the company expects the new line will cost approximately  additional projects are planned with a total expected outlay of approximately  all capital expenditures are expected to be funded with cash flow from operations 
in addition  in march of the company purchased the operating assets and inventory of frescala foods  inc frescala for a consideration of  in cash and  options with immediate vesting to purchase shares of the company s common stock see notes and 
the options have an approximate fair market value of  an exercise price of per share  and a three year expiration 
additionally  frescala owners could receive an earn out based upon frescala sales above a predetermined level 
the earn out will be calculated during the first year of combined operations 
funding for the transaction will come from a new  two year term note  use of existing accounts receivable and inventory line  and cash flow from operations 
management believes that the company s credit facility and cash generated from continuing operations will provide adequate funding to meet its needs for normal operations through sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing strategy targets sustainable growth 
its focus is on increasing sales through expansion of its club store and retail grocery business  increasing its distribution through the rapidly growing number of natural and organic food retailers  and the introduction of innovative new products designed to meet consumer needs 
expansion of the company s club store business continued in with the addition of costco wholesale s northwest and midwest divisions with total warehouses  and introduction of the company s products into costco s los angeles division 
distribution of the company s products continues to grow with the national expansion of sam s club 
monterey pasta s products are now found in over sam s club locations 
during the company s retail grocery distribution increased significantly with the addition of over stores in the seattle and portland divisions of safeway  the addition of stores in kroger s louisville division  and the introduction of the company s products into the chicago market in over jewel locations 
monterey pasta s products are made with no preservatives or artificial ingredients 
capitalizing on this strength  the company continues to pursue increased distribution through natural and organic food retailers  whose growth has exceeded in recent years 
the company estimates there are potential natural and organic retail grocery stores available  which are potential markets for its products 
to fulfill its objective of introducing innovative new products  in the company introduced its new line of restaurant style pastas and sauces  which feature the largest ravioli currently available to the fresh grocery consumer 
offerings in the line include artichoke and cheese ravioli  chicken piccata ravioli  gorgonzola cheese ravioli  snow crab ravioli  roasted garlic  herb and cheese ravioli  shrimp scampi ravioli  spinach ricotta ravioli  pesto sausage tortelloni  rainbow five cheese tortelloni  roasted garlic parmesan sauce  basil cream sauce with artichokes and pesto sauce with garlic and basil 
also in  the company introduced a new line of gourmet meat sauces  which are the first refrigerated  fresh meat sauces widely available in the marketplace 
varieties in the line are italian sausage sauce  sun dried tomato sausage sauce  and homestyle pasta sauce made with ground beef 
cost reductions the company significantly reduced its total corporate and plant administrative headcount and costs on a going forward basis as part of the plan adopted in the fourth quarter of in order to return to profitable operations and optimize financial performance 
in january  the company relocated its corporate headquarters from san francisco  california to its manufacturing facility in salinas  california 
this move resulted in a substantial reduction of future corporate and overhead costs  beginning in the second quarter of also in  the company significantly reduced the scope of its advertising and media campaigns 
the company will continue with those promotional activities  such as in store demonstrations  that it considers effective and consistent with its ongoing sales objectives 
in this light  the company s slotting fees from club stores and grocery chains for shelf space allocations  for example  declined significantly starting in the fourth quarter of total selling  general and administrative expenses declined to  a million decrease compared to in the company increased its sales and marketing expenditures by  to  a level more consistent with sustained growth 
this increase was offset by an  decrease in professional fees and insurance expense  and overall sg a expenses were reduced once again  by  to  management believes the current level of sg a expenses is consistent with efficient operations  and additional expenses in future periods  mainly in the sales and marketing area  will be directly associated with increased levels of sales 
in an effort to sustain its commitment to reduce cost of production  the company will continue to invest in a variety of machinery and equipment and leasehold improvements in retooling its salinas production facilities 
the company has spent approximately million over the past two years in equipment and facilities improvements 
major customers two of the company s retail customers  costco and sam s  accounted for and  respectively of the company s sales for the twelve months ended december  no other customer accounted for greater than of net revenues for the period 
business risks certain characteristics and dynamics of the company s business and of financial markets generally create risks to the company s long term success and to predictable quarterly results 
these risks include recent operating losses no assurance of continued profitability 
in the second quarter of  the company reported its first operating loss from continuing operations 
subsequent to that quarter the company incurred losses through the first quarter of  after which it regained profitability  which has continued for seven consecutive quarters 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its recent profitability in the long term 
dependence on major customers need to diversify distribution 
during  two customers accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
loss of either of these customers  costco or sam s club stores  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is seeking to diversify its distribution channels by adding additional grocery and club store chains as customers 
failure to diversify its customer base could have a material adverse effect on the company s future growth and profitability 
liquidity need for additional capital 
management believes that its operations and existing bank lines of credit will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s planned capital and operating requirements for normal operations through if the company s operations do not provide cash sufficient to fund its operations  and the company seeks outside financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing when needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  any future equity financing or convertible debt financing would cause the company s stockholders to incur dilution in net tangible book value per share of common stock 
hiring and retention of key personnel management transition 
the success of the company depends on its ability to operate under new management that was retained in mid  and to motivate and retain key employees and officers 
there can be no assurance that the company s new management team will be able to perform effectively  or that significant management turnover will not continue in the future 
the company has key man insurance policies in place in the face amount of  for its chief executive officer  r 
lance hewitt  and its chief financial officer  stephen l 
brinkman 
impact of inflation 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations to date 
substantial increases in labor  employee benefits  freight  energy  ingredients and packaging  rents and other operating expenses could adversely affect the operations of the company s business in future periods 
the company cannot predict whether such increases will occur in the future 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially since the initial public offering of the company s common stock in december such volatility may  in part  be attributable to the company s operating results or to changes in the direction of the company s expansion efforts 
in addition  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the food industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies  including the company  for reasons sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
any shortfall in the company s net sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or the market could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
risks inherent in food production 
the company faces all of the risks inherent in the production and distribution of refrigerated food products  including contamination  adulteration and spoilage  and the associated risks of product liability litigation and declines in the price of its stock may be associated with even an isolated event 
the company has a modern production facility  employs what it believes is state of the art thermal processing  temperature controlled storage  haacp programs intended to insure food safety  and has obtained usda approval for its production plant 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s procedures will be adequate to prevent the occurrence of such events 
seasonality and quarterly results 
the company s grocery and club store accounts are expected to experience seasonal fluctuations to some extent 
the company s business in general may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including but not limited to general economic trends  competition  marketing programs  and special or unusual events 
dependence on common carriers 
the company continues to be dependent on common carriers to distribute its products 
any disruption in its distribution system or increase in the costs thereof could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
marketing and sales risks 
the future success of the company s efforts will depend on a number of factors  including whether grocery and club store chains will continue to expand the number of their individual stores offering the company s products and whether allowances and other incentives will expand retail distribution 
expansion into new markets increases the risk of significant product returns resulting from the company s supply of slower selling items to its customers 
in addition  grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future 
should these channels choose to reduce or eliminate products  the company could experience a significant reduction in its product sales 
as indicated previously  the company remains dependent on the use of slotting allowances and other incentives to expand retail distribution 
in order to reduce risk  the company has significantly reduced expansion into new markets requiring such major expenditures 
year many computer systems were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company utilizes software vendors for its major computer program applications 
the company has a task force in place to address year issues and installation of a year compliant version of the company s financial  inventory  and production software was completed in november  the company has also completed an assessment of its internal personal computer network  which is expected to be year compliant by the end of march updating telephones  facsimile machines and labeling equipment for year is scheduled to be complete by mid in addition  the company has been in contact with its suppliers and other third parties to determine the extent  which they may be vulnerable to year issues 
as this assessment continues  matters may come to the company s attention  which could give rise to the need for remedial measures  which have not yet been identified 
the company cannot currently predict the potential effect of third parties year issues on its business 
it is expected that assessment  remediation and contingency planning activities will be on going throughout  with the goal of appropriately resolving all material internal systems and third party issues 
the company intends to utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  replace and test the systems for the year modifications 
the company does not believe that the cost of becoming year compliant will be in excess of  to date the company has incurred minor expenses  primarily for assessment of the year issue  development of a modification plan  and for the installation of a year compliant version of its financial  inventory  and production software 
the cost of the project and the dates on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved 
failure to be year compliant in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial condition 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers disclosures about postretirement benefits 
sfas no 
standardizes the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits to the extent practicable  requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets that will facilitate financial analysis  and eliminates certain disclosures that are no longer as useful as they were when previous related accounting standards were issued 
sfas is effective for financial statements for years beginning after december  and requires comparative information for earlier years to be restated unless the information is not readily available  in which case the notes to the financial statements should include all available information and a description of the information not available 
management has not yet determined whether the company s current financial statement disclosures will need to be modified based upon current operations 
results of operations and financial position will be unaffected by implementation of this standard 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge  the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of i the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or ii the earnings effect of the hedged forecast transaction 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after june  historically the company has not entered into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
accordingly  the company does not expect adoption of this new standard to affect its financial statements
