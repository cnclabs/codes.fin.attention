item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading operator and consolidator in the highly fragmented automotive retailing industry 
we own automobile dealership franchises located in texas  oklahoma  florida  new mexico  georgia and colorado 
we sell new and used cars and light trucks  provide maintenance and repair services at all of our dealerships  and operate collision service centers 
we expect a significant portion of our future growth to come from acquisitions of additional dealerships 
we have diverse sources of revenues  including new car sales  new truck sales  used car sales  used truck sales  manufacturer remarketed vehicle sales  parts sales  service sales  collision repair services  finance fees  insurance commissions  vehicle service contract commissions  documentary fees and after market product sales 
sales revenues from new and used vehicle sales and parts and service sales include sales to retail customers  other dealerships and wholesalers 
other dealership revenue includes revenue from arranging financing  insurance and vehicle service contracts  net of a provision for anticipated chargebacks  and documentary fees 
our gross profit varies as our merchandise mix the mix between new vehicle sales  used vehicle sales  parts and service sales  collision repair services and other dealership revenues changes 
our gross margin on the sale of products and services generally varies between approximately and  with new vehicle sales generally resulting in the lowest gross margin and other dealership revenue sales generally resulting in the highest gross margin 
when our new vehicle sales increase or decrease at a rate greater than our other revenue sources  our gross margin responds inversely 
factors such as seasonality  weather  cyclicality and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact our merchandise mix  and therefore influence our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for sales  administrative  finance and general management personnel  rent  marketing  insurance and utilities 
interest expense consists of interest charges on interest bearing debt  including floorplan inventory financing  net of interest income earned 
until we acquired them  all of the dealerships had been managed as independent private companies and their results of operations reflect different tax structures s corporations and c corporations which influenced  among other things  their historical levels of owners compensation 
certain of these owners and key employees agreed to reductions in their compensation and benefits in connection with their acquisition by us 
we are integrating certain functions and installing practices that have been successful at other franchises and in other retail segments best practices 
this integration of functions and installation of best practices may present opportunities to increase revenues and reduce costs but may also necessitate additional costs and expenditures for corporate administration  including expenses necessary to implement our acquisition strategy 
these various costs and possible cost savings and revenue enhancements may make historical operating results difficult to compare to and not indicative of  future performance 
pro forma combined founding groups data the pro forma combined founding groups data presented below for and do not purport to present the combined founding groups in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  but represent a summation of certain data of the individual founding groups on a historical basis  including the effects of the pro forma adjustments 
such information does not give effect to any other acquisitions that were made by us other than the founding groups 
this data will not be comparable to and may not be indicative of our post combination results of operations because i the founding groups were not under common control of management and had different tax structures during the periods presented and ii we used the purchase method to establish a new basis of accounting to record the acquisitions 
the financial information presented below for the year ended december  reflects the historical results of our operations and includes acquisitions made during such period  from the effective dates  for accounting purposes  of the acquisitions

revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  new vehicle revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase in revenue was primarily attributable to strong customer acceptance of our products  particularly toyota  lexus  honda and acura  and the acquisition of additional dealership operations during the increase was partially offset by reduced sales at our nissan franchises  which declined due to reduced manufacturer sales incentives as compared to the prior year 
used vehicle revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an emphasis on used vehicle sales in the oklahoma and houston  texas markets and the additional dealership operations acquired 
parts and service sales increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the additional dealership operations acquired 
other dealership revenues increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the implementation of our vehicle service contract and insurance programs  which resulted in improved revenues per unit  and an increase in the number of retail new and used vehicles sold 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to increased revenues and an increase in gross margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this increase was caused by improvements in the gross margin earned on used vehicle sales and parts and service sales  and a change in the merchandising mix  as higher margin other dealership revenues increased as a percentage of total revenues 
partially offsetting the gross margin increases  the gross margin on new retail vehicle sales declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decline is attributable primarily to reduced margins in the nissan product line due to reduced manufacturer sales incentives in the gross margin on used retail vehicle sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an emphasis on used vehicle operations in the oklahoma platform 
pro forma combined founding groups year ended december  compared with pro forma combined founding groups year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  new vehicle revenues increased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to significant revenue growth from maturing round rock nissan and bob howard dodge franchise operations  successful marketing efforts and strong customer acceptance of the founding groups products  particularly lexus 
used vehicle revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the maturing franchise operations  successful marketing efforts and an emphasis on used vehicle sales in the oklahoma market to mitigate the impact of lower than expected new vehicle demand 
parts and service sales increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the maturing dealership operations and increased vehicle sales 
other dealership revenues increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of retail new and used vehicle sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to increased revenues and a stable overall gross margin 
the gross margin on new retail vehicle sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  primarily due to stronger margins in the lexus and nissan product lines  partially offset by reduced margins in the oklahoma market 
the gross margin for retail used vehicle sales declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decline was primarily attributable to efforts to increase market share in the oklahoma market while customer demand for new vehicles was not as strong as in prior years

gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the inclusion of dealership operations acquired since october  and improvement in our gross profit margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this improvement was the result of an increase in revenues from parts and service and other dealership revenues as a percentage of total revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the dealership operations acquired since october  interest expense  net 
floorplan and other interest expense  net  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the floorplan interest expense of our additional dealership operations acquired and additional interest expense due to borrowings on our credit facility to complete acquisitions 
partially offsetting the increases were expense reductions realized due to lower interest rates on floorplan notes payable obtained through our credit facility 
pro forma net income 
pro forma net income increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  excluding the impact of an  non cash compensation charge in  pro forma net income as a percentage of revenues increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the non cash compensation charge related to grants of equity to certain key employees of the howard group  prior to our acquisition of the howard group

gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the inclusion of the acquisitions for the last two months of the year  which was partially offset by a reduced gross margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decline was due primarily to reduced vehicle gross margins 
the reduced vehicle margin was caused by an emphasis on increasing market share in the oklahoma market while customer demand was not as strong as in prior years 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the acquisitions for last two months of the year and a one time  non cash compensation charge recorded by the howard group for grants of equity to certain key employees of the howard group

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash from operations  our credit facility which includes the floorplan facility and the acquisition facility and equity and debt offerings 
the following table sets forth historical selected information from our statements of cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    net increase in cash and cash equivalents    cash flows total cash and cash equivalents at december   were million 
operating activities 
for the three year period ended december   we generated million in net cash from operating activities  primarily driven by net income plus depreciation and amortization 
cash flow provided by operating activities increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the dealership operations acquired since october  investing activities 
we obtained approximately million from investing activities in  primarily from the cash balances obtained in the acquisitions of the founding groups 
the million of cash used for investing activities during was primarily attributable to cash paid in completing acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  and purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by sales of property and equipment 
of the million used in purchasing property and equipment  approximately million related to the purchase of land and construction of facilities for new or expanded operations  including a new lexus companion dealership located in south houston  which we expect to be opened by the third quarter of during december  we completed the sale and leaseback of six dealership properties and received million in gross proceeds from the sale 
financing activities 
we obtained approximately million and million from financing activities in and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities for was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of our initial public offering of approximately million offset primarily by the pay down of floorplan debt in the amount of million 
the net cash provided during was generated primarily from drawings on our credit facility and was utilized in completing acquisitions and supporting increased sales volumes 
partially offsetting the million in borrowings was million in principal payments on long term debt  of which million was related to the payoff of mortgages in connection with the sale and leaseback transaction completed in december working capital 
at december   we had working capital of million 
historically  we have funded our operations with internally generated cash flow and borrowings 
while we cannot guarantee it  based on current facts and circumstances  management believes we have adequate cash flow coupled with borrowings under our credit facility to fund our current operations 
acquisition financing we anticipate that our primary use of cash will be for the completion of acquisitions 
we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from the operating cash flows of our existing dealerships  borrowings under our current credit facilities  other borrowings or equity or debt offerings 
although we believe that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital to fund acquisitions  we cannot guarantee that such capital will be available to us at the time it is required or on terms acceptable to us 
see cautionary statement about forward looking statements 
recent offerings 
in march  we completed offerings  in which we sold two million shares of common stock and million of year senior subordinated notes with an interest rate of 
we received proceeds  before our expenses  of million 
all of the proceeds were used to temporarily repay borrowings under our credit facility 
these proceeds are expected to be used in the future to complete acquisitions  resulting in increased borrowings under the credit facility 
credit facility in november  we amended our credit facility to increase the commitment from million to million which was reduced to million upon consummation of the offerings and to extend the term of the credit facility from december to december the credit facility provides a floorplan facility of million for financing vehicle inventories and an acquisition facility of million which was reduced to million upon consummation of the offerings  for financing acquisitions  general corporate purposes and capital expenditures 
currently  million is available to be drawn under the acquisition facility  subject to a cash flow calculation and the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
additionally  the credit facility contains various covenants  including financial ratios and other requirements  which must be maintained by us 
the credit facility also limits the amount we may pay as cash dividends 
in january  we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
this swap converts the interest rate on million of debt to a fixed rate of approximately 
floorplan financing we currently obtain floorplan financing for vehicle inventory through our credit facility 
this debt bears interest at the rate of libor plus basis points 
sale of dealership properties to a reit 
on december   we entered into an agreement with a reit to sell nine of our dealership properties for approximately million in cash 
in connection with the sale of the properties  we have agreed to leaseback the properties under leases with terms of years  with tenant termination options after  and years 
as of december   we had closed the sale of six properties to the reit  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  for approximately million 
we generally seek to avoid the ownership of real property 
accordingly we intend to continue to enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to minimize our investment in acquired and constructed facilities 
leases we lease various real estate  facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements  including leases with related parties 
substantially all related party leases have terms of years and are cancelable at our option ten years from execution of the lease and at the end of each subsequent five year period 
cautionary statement about forward looking statements this annual report and management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements appear in a number of places in this annual report and include statements regarding our plans  beliefs or current expectations  including those plans  beliefs and expectations of our officers and directors with respect to  among other things o future acquisitions  o expected future cost savings  o future capital expenditures  o trends affecting our future financial condition or results of operations  and o our business strategy regarding future operations 
any such forward looking statements are not assurances of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from anticipated results for a number of reasons  including o industry conditions  o future demand for new and used vehicles  o restrictions imposed on us by automobile manufacturers  o the ability to obtain the consents of automobile manufacturers to our acquisitions  o the availability of capital resources  and o the willingness of acquisition candidates to accept our common stock as currency 
the information contained in this annual report  including the information set forth below and under the heading business  identifies additional factors that could affect our operating results and performance 
we urge you to carefully consider those factors 
all forward looking statements attributable to us are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
dependence on acquisitions for growth growth in our revenues and earnings will depend significantly on our ability to acquire and successfully operate dealerships 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire dealerships in the future 
in addition  managing and integrating additional dealerships into our existing mix of dealerships may result in substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
restrictions by our manufacturers as well as covenants contained in our debt instruments limit our ability to acquire additional dealerships 
in addition  increased competition for acquisition candidates may develop  which could result in fewer acquisition opportunities available to us and or higher acquisition prices 
further  acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including possible diversion of resources and management s attention  inability to retain key acquired personnel and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will continue to need substantial capital in order to acquire additional automobile dealerships 
in the past  we have financed these acquisitions with a combination of cash flow from operations  proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities with banks and issuances of our common stock 
we cannot guarantee that these sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our acquisition program and other cash needs  or that we will be able to obtain adequate additional capital from other sources 
we expect to utilize our current credit facility to borrow a portion of the funds required for acquisitions 
if funds under the credit facility are insufficient to fund our acquisition program  we will be required to obtain alternative financing such as from the issuance of additional debt or equity securities or an expansion or replacement of the credit facility 
we currently intend to finance acquisitions by issuing shares of common stock as full or partial consideration for acquired dealerships 
the extent to which we will be able or willing to issue common stock for acquisitions will depend on the market value of the common stock from time to time and the willingness of potential acquisition candidates to accept common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses 
if potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept our common stock  we will be forced to rely solely on available cash or debt or equity financing  which could adversely affect our acquisition program 
accordingly  our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected if the price of our common stock declines 
contingent acquisition payments in our early acquisitions in which we issued shares of our common stock as consideration  we guaranteed to the recipients of the shares that they will receive a minimum price for their shares if they sell the shares in the market 
in the event that they do not receive the guaranteed price in a sale  we are required to pay them the difference between the price they received and the guaranteed price 
as of december   there were  shares of common stock subject to our guarantee with a weighted average guarantee price of approximately per share 
these guarantees have terms of three years to ten years with a weighted average term of approximately years 
if the price of our common stock declines substantially and we are required to perform on our guarantees  our liquidity and ability to finance our acquisition program could be adversely affected 
in addition  in many of our acquisitions  we may be required to pay contingent consideration to the former stockholders of the acquired dealerships based on an increase in earnings before taxes of their operations during certain periods of time 
we cannot determine whether or how much we will have to pay under these contingent payment arrangements 
if we are required to make any of these contingent payments  we will have to pay approximately one half of each payment in common stock and one half in cash 
if these contingent payments must be paid in full  our liquidity and ability to finance our acquisition program could be adversely affected 
dependence on the success of our manufacturers our success depends upon the overall success of the line of vehicles that each of our dealerships sells 
demand for our manufacturers vehicles as well as the financial condition  management  marketing  production and distribution capabilities of our manufacturers affect our business 
although we have attempted to lessen our dependence on any one manufacturer by buying dealerships representing a number of different domestic and foreign manufacturers  events such as labor disputes and other production disruptions that may adversely affect a manufacturer may also adversely affect us 
similarly  the late delivery of vehicles from manufacturers  which sometimes occurs during periods of new product introductions  can lead to reduced sales during those periods 
moreover  any event that causes adverse publicity involving any of our manufacturers may have an adverse effect on us regardless of whether such event involves any of our dealerships 
year conversion year issues result from the inability of computer programs or computerized equipment to accurately calculate  store or use a date subsequent to december  the erroneous date can be interpreted in a number of different ways  typically the year is represented as the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
we have recognized the need to ensure that our computer systems  equipment and operations will not be adversely impacted by the change to the calendar year as such  we have taken steps to identify potential areas of risk and are addressing these in our planning  purchasing and daily operations 
we have conducted a third party survey of all of the individual dealership systems  equipment and operations and are in the process of developing an action plan to correct deficiencies before year end 
the total cost of converting all internal systems  equipment and operations for the year has not been fully quantified  but it is not expected to be material to our financial position 
in connection with acquisitions  we review and address each candidate s year readiness during the due diligence process 
we are currently reviewing the potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third party service providers and vendors to prepare for the year we are dependent upon our dealerships computer systems in our daily operations 
all of our dealerships are  or are expected to be  using a computer system supported by a major automobile dealership computer system provider 
we have contacted each of our providers and have received written assurance from them that their systems are  or will be  year ready 
we are dependent upon these providers  as are most dealerships in the united states  to address the year issues 
we are primarily dependent upon the manufacturers for the production and delivery of new vehicles and parts 
although we have no reason to believe that our manufacturers will not be year ready  we have been unable to obtain written assurance from them that their systems are year ready 
while we are in the process of developing contingency plans  failure by us  our manufacturers or third party service providers and vendors to adequately address the year issue could have an adverse effect on us 
if we or our third party service providers do not adequately address the year issue  we may be required to handle all business on a handwritten basis 
while this would reduce operational efficiency  we would still be able to continue our operations 
if our manufacturers fail to adequately address the year issue  and do not correct the problems timely  we may experience shortages in new vehicle and parts inventories 
cyclicality our operations  like the automotive retailing industry in general  can be impacted by a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including consumer business cycles  consumer confidence  economic conditions  availability of consumer credit and interest rates 
although the above factors  among others  may impact our business  we believe the impact on our operations of future negative trends in such factors will be somewhat mitigated by our i strong parts  service and collision repair services  ii variable cost salary structure  iii geographic diversity and iv product diversity 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations  with the second and third quarters generally contributing more operating profit than the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is driven by three primary forces i manufacturer related factors  primarily the historical timing of major manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers  ii weather related factors and iii consumer buying patterns 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss
