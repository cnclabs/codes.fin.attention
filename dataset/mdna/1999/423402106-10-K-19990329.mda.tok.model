quarterly and seasonal fluctuations the company has experienced in the past and will experience in the future quarterly variations in net sales and net income as a result of many factors  including the number and timing of catalog mailings  catalog response rates  product mix  the level of selling  general and administrative expenses  the timing and level of product development expenses  and the timing and success of new product introductions by the company or its competitors 
the company s planned operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts 
if net sales are below expectations in any given quarter  operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the company expects that its business will continue to exhibit some measure of volatility between quarters in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources hello direct s primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations  proceeds from its initial public offering  venture capital equity and debt financing  and borrowings under its revolving bank line of credit 
cash provided by operating activities in was  this was the result of  provided by operations including net income  depreciation and amortization and other non cash charges offset by  of changes in operating assets and liabilities

in  the company expects to continue to purchase additional capital equipment for enhancements to its management information systems and tooling for proprietary products  and such purchases are expected to exceed levels 
in the fourth quarter of  the company used  for the purchase of  shares of treasury stock at an average purchase price of a share pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved by the company s board of directors on october  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock in the open market from time to time subject to market conditions and other restrictions 
the number of shares of common stock eventually acquired by the company will depend on subsequent developments and corporate needs  and the repurchase program may be interrupted or discontinued at any time 
any shares repurchased would be available for re issuance under the company s employee stock plans 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  together with available funds remaining from the net proceeds of its initial public offering  will be sufficient to fund its needs for working capital for the foreseeable future 
however  should the company need additional funds  it has an unsecured line of credit of  with a major bank at the bank s prime lending rate 
at present  the company has not directly borrowed under this line  and as of december   the company was not contingently liable for any issued and open letters of credit 
impact of the year issue the year issue results from computer programs written using a two digit date field  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
certain computer programs utilizing a two digit date field may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could potentially result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in other similar normal business activities 
the company s internal information systems include all hardware and software used in its computer and phone systems 
the company has completed an assessment of its internal information systems relative to the year issue 
the assessment review was broken down between information systems scheduled for replacement or modification before the year as a part of the company s ongoing technology review and assessment process and information systems that have not been scheduled for replacement or modification 
in connection with the assessment of information systems scheduled for replacement or modification  the company has confirmed the hardware and software replacing or modifying existing hardware and software is year compliant 
the information systems scheduled for replacement or modification are expected to be complete no later than the third quarter of however  if the information systems currently scheduled for replacement or modification are not replaced or are not properly modified  the year issue could have a material effect on the on the operations of the company by impairing the company s ability to process transactions  send invoices and engage in normal business activities 
in connection with systems not scheduled for replacement  the company has performed an accounting of these systems  contacted vendors and documented its findings 
the findings indicate that although some information systems not scheduled for replacement are not compliant  the cost of replacing or upgrading those systems will not have a material effect on the operations of the company 
to date  the company has expensed approximately  on year project costs and total year project costs are not expected to exceed  in addition  the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
the company has received some assurances regarding these issues from its vendors  but there are no guarantees these third party systems will be compliant and in the event of non compliance would not have a material effect on the operations of the company 
for example  if some of the company s product vendors are not year compliant  it could impact the company s ability to obtain products from those vendors on a timely basis 
the company has evaluated its exposure to contingencies related to the year issues for products it has sold 
although the company believes that its products do not directly contain specific calendar year functions  it is possible customers may use the company s products in conjunction with systems that may perform non compliant year date computations 
accordingly  there is a risk of litigation associated with the possible use of the company s products by customers  including all the risks  costs and uncertainties associated with litigation 
the company believes its exposure to the year issue will come mainly from third parties  either the result of these parties not being prepared or other parties these third parties rely upon not being prepared 
although there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not be encountered  the company expects that all critical internal year issues will be resolved as scheduled 
subsequent events on january   the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire phonezone 
com  inc a privately held company for  in a combination of cash and stock

the internet site serves a growing number of regular business end users who have virtually no alternative single point of contact for conveniently researching  comparing  and buying such a wide range of telecom solutions 
this acquisition positions the company to accelerate its electronic commerce initiative and more quickly exploit the internet s potential to become the ultimate direct marketing channel for hello direct 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires that costs of start up activities be charged to expense as incurred and broadly defines such costs 
the company has not deferred any costs as defined in sop  accordingly  upon adoption on january   there will be no charge to earnings for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for the three months ending march  this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations
