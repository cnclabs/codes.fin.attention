readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the company in this report that attempt to advise interested parties of certain risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect our business 
overview pairgain technologies  inc pairgain is a leading provider of telecommunications products based on high speed digital subscriber line xdsl technology 
we design  manufacture  market and support a comprehensive line of digital telecommunications products that allow telecommunications carriers and private network owners to more efficiently provide high speed digital services to end users over the large existing infrastructure of unconditioned copper wires 
these services enable high speed data transmission for applications such as t e  high speed internet access  telecommuting  wide area networking and video conferencing 
our first product was pg  a two channel digital subscriber carrier system  which was initially shipped in late in  we undertook the development of our higain products  which were first shipped in june in june  we introduced our campus line of products  and in  began shipping our pg flex product  a subscriber carrier system for delivering up to voice channels over two pair of copper wires 
in the first quarter of  we commenced shipments of our pg plus and etsi products 
revenues from higain products represented approximately of our total revenues in  and and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
although revenues from sales of higain products are expected to continue to account for a majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future  we believe that revenues from sales of our pg flex  pg plus and other new products will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues in the future 
commencing in mid  we began reducing the average selling prices of our higain products in an effort to increase market demand for our products and in anticipation of expected price competition 
these reductions have been significant  representing reductions of then current prices averaging as much as in  in and in although future effects of price competition and other competitive pressures inherent in our business are uncertain  we expect to continue to reduce the average selling prices of our higain and other products 
accordingly  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will depend in part upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products at rates sufficient to compensate for the reduced revenue effect of such continuing reductions in the average selling prices of our existing products 
declining average selling prices may also adversely affect gross margins on our existing products if we are unable to fully offset such reductions in average selling prices by reductions in our per unit costs through cost reduction resulting from engineering design changes  reduced prices for components  increased manufacturing efficiencies and increases in volume 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or further reduce our per unit costs in the future 
results of operations the results of operations discussed below are comprised of two sections 
the first section compares to for all items noted on the consolidated statements of income contained in a separate section of this annual report on form k commencing on page f the second section compares to for the same items 
all share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock splits effective june  and december  and have been restated to reflect the adoption of sfas no 
 for all periods presented 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended december  revenues product sales royalty income and technology licensing fees total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative merger expenses total operating expenses income from operations other income  loss interest and other income  net impairment adjustment and loss on note receivable and long term investments settlement income related to unauthorized trading of investments by third parties income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to revenues revenues of million in were essentially flat when compared with revenues of million 
although product revenues decreased to million in compared to million in  royalty income and technology fees increased to million in versus  in the decrease in product revenues was largely the result of a decrease in revenues from sales of higain products 
unit shipments of higain products during were higher than unit shipments  but average selling prices decreased 
this decline in higain revenue was offset by increases in sales of etsi  pg flex and pg plus products 
revenues from sales of etsi products increased in despite a decrease in average selling prices for those products 
revenues from sales of pg flex and pg plus products were more than three times the level of sales in pg flex and pg plus revenues represented of total revenue  up from of total revenues 
we expect that pg flex and pg plus revenues will continue to become a greater portion of total revenue in the future 
revenues from sales of pg and campus products decreased and  respectively  in compared to  the result of decreased unit shipments and lower average selling prices 
unit shipments of pg products decreased and average selling prices decreased in unit shipments of campus products decreased and average selling prices decreased in the increase in royalty income and technology fees was primarily the result of the falcon chip licensing agreement entered into during the first quarter of aggregate sales to local telephone companies affiliated with the five rbocs accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for and  respectively 
revenue per average employee decreased to  in  compared to  in as reported in form q for the quarter ended september   a large customer awarded a primary source hdsl contract to one of our competitors during the fourth quarter of we previously supplied the dominant share of hdsl product to this account 
we expect there will be a decline in hdsl revenue sold to this account  although the amount of the decline is not known 
this decline could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
gross profit gross profit represents total revenues for a period  including royalty income  less the cost of revenues for such period 
cost of revenues represents primarily product costs  together with associated overhead expenditures and provisions for inventory and warranty reserves 
in  our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased to from in the decrease in gross margin percentage was largely the result of decreases in average selling prices  which were partially offset by our cost reduction efforts and higher margin royalty income 
we continue to place emphasis on continuing cost reduction through engineering design changes  reduced prices for components  increased manufacturing efficiencies and increase in volume to offset declining average selling prices of our products 
we expect that increased competition will continue to place downward pressure on average selling prices 
to the extent that we are unable to offset these decreases with our cost reduction efforts  or to introduce and sell new products with higher gross product margins  we will continue to experience a decline in our gross margin 
operating expenses operating expenses  excluding merger expenses  increased to million in from million in nearly half of the increase in absolute operating expense levels related to selling and marketing expenditures and approximately one third of the increase related to research and development expenses

the remainder of the increases consisted of outside development consulting fees  external engineering charges and costs specific to achieving new product approval  offset by reimbursement for development services sold to outside parties 
selling and marketing expense increased to million in from million in the increase in expense levels was primarily due to the addition of personnel and the associated increase in salaries  benefits and travel expenses  and additional advertising  trade show and other promotional expenditures designed to market our new products and technology 
in addition  costs related to the expansion of our presence in the international market increased over the prior year 
we anticipate higher selling and marketing spending levels in the future in order to maintain our leadership position in the xdsl market and to secure market share in the subscriber and megabit access markets 
selling and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues was in and in general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in fees for outside services related to the upgrade of our software systems  and increases in expenditures for computer software and equipment repair and maintenance  insurance and legal fees represented the majority of these increases

year readiness disclosure many of the world s computer systems currently record years in a two digit format 
such computer systems will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could lead to business disruptions globally the year issue 
the potential costs and uncertainties associated with the year issue will depend on a number of factors  including software  hardware and the nature of the industry in which a company operates 
additionally  companies must coordinate with other entities with which they electronically interact  such as customers  creditors and suppliers 
the following discussion addresses the manner in which the year issue affects pairgain  including our state of readiness  the costs to address our year issues  the risks of our year issues  and our contingency plans 
our state of readiness in determining our state of readiness regarding the year issue  management is assessing compliance in the following areas our products  our internal systems and the readiness of our key suppliers and major customers 
we have implemented a year project the project to address and correct year compliance issues with regard to our operating systems and the readiness of our suppliers and customers 
the project is administered by a steering committee  which includes senior representatives from operations  engineering  finance  information management and independent outside consultants 
the project is composed of five phases o awareness  o inventory and assessment  o replacement and upgrade  o testing and validation  and o implementation and post implementation 
the awareness phase is intended to ensure that our senior management  board of directors  associates and customers are aware of the year issue and the possible problems it may cause 
initial contact has been completed  and communication will continue throughout the span of the project and beyond december  to ensure successful business operation after the year the inventory and assessment phase of the project will assess the readiness of all computer hardware and software that we  including all of our departments  business partners  properties and interfaces to vendors  use in all aspects of our business operations 
this includes  but is not limited to  information technology systems and non information technology systems which may include embedded technology such as microcontrollers as follows information technology systems non information technology systems o personal computer hardware  software and o alarms applications o access systems and door locks o local area networks hardware  software and o facsimile and photocopy machines applications o building systems including elevators  o mainframe hardware  software and applications hvac  life safety systems  public o telephone systems utilities and others our products that are currently being sold or that have been sold in the past will be classified into three main categories 
o no impact units with no internal electronics or processing capabilities or units with processing capabilities that do not perform date math calculations 
o minor impact units that possess date math processing capabilities  but any year related failure with either have no impact on the actual performance of the unit ie  incorrect date display only  or would require a one time user intervention to rest the unit once the clock turned from december  to january  units in this category will be reviewed on a case by case basis by the product manager to determine whether or not testing is warranted 
o major impact units that possess significant date math processing capabilities 
every unit in this classification will be tested for year compliance 
we have adopted bellcore gr core  issue standard for definition of year compliant products as the majority of our products are sold to bell operating companies 
testing of our products is being completed by nationally recognized test labs nrtl 
to date  all pairgain products tested have been year compliant without modification 
if any products are subsequently determined not to be compliant  we have pledged to immediately notify all customers who have purchased any of the non complaint products and to upgrade or replace any of the installed  non compliant products in accordance with our standard warranty policy  regardless of whether the equipment is still in the warranty period 
inventory of our internal systems has been completed 
an assessment of the readiness of the external entities with which we interface such as vendors  customers  payment systems and others is ongoing 
letters were sent to of our suppliers 
responses have been received from of those companies with indicating they were already year compliant and the remaining still working on the issue 
we have multiple sources for almost every part that we use in our products 
if any one supplier cannot  for one reason or another  comply with the year requirements  we anticipate being able to procure the parts from another supplier who is compliant 
we plan to work closely with those suppliers who provide sole source components to ensure that they are year compliant before any interruption occurs or will address the sole source issue in other ways 
we have established a target date of july  for completion of this task 
our major customers have disclosed their intent to be year compliant by december  in recent sec filings and on public websites 
we continue to have formal communications with all of our significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent  if any  to which we are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issue 
there can be no guarantee that our systems or the systems of other companies will be compliant in a timely manner 
we are aggressively seeking resolution to those situations which might carry a material impact and might adversely affect us 
during the replacement and upgrade phase of the project  our internal software and systems that are not year compliant will be repaired or replaced 
in addition  vendor monitoring will be performed to ensure and oversee efforts made by vendors regarding year compliance 
it is our intention to gain year compliance assurances with all new contracts and leases  renewals of existing contracts and purchases of software applications 
this phase is expected to be completed by july  during the testing and validation phase  a standard test methodology will be used to ensure that all components correctly handle the century date changes and that those changes do not adversely impact current functionality and operation of the components 
a checklist of ten minimum requirements was created to certify an internal system or application is compliant 
the target date for completion of the initial testing and validation of components has been set for july  testing and validation of these systems will continue through the end of to ensure successful business operations 
during the implementation and post implementation phase  components will be implemented into production upon completion of upgrade and testing  and operated in a production environment 
constant monitoring and communication will also be a focus point and objective 
a system change control process will be used to ensure that subsequent changes are not made to year compliant components unless those changes have been tested for compliance 
implementation of the project is expected to be completed by july  a team will be established to cater to all questions and issues that may arise during and post century change 
post implementation  including continued monitoring and communication  will continue through march  to ensure our successful operation after january  the costs to address our year issues the total cost to address our year issue is not expected to be material to our financial condition 
we are using both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test our software for year modifications 
we do not separately track internal costs incurred on the year project  which principally include payroll and related costs for our information management employees that are being expensed as incurred 
excluding internal costs  we have budgeted approximately million for activities specific to the year compliance of our information systems 
an additional million has been budgeted for various other upgrades to software and hardware related to operational functionality which will also make those systems year compliant 
purchased hardware and software will be capitalized in accordance with our standard capitalization policy 
all other costs related to the project are being expensed as incurred 
budgeted amounts are expected to be spent during and but will not be incurred equally over all phases of the project 
as of december  we had spent approximately million of these budgeted amounts 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
the risks of our year issues we have placed great importance on our year project and anticipate that our systems will be year compliant before the end of the following are representative of the types of risks that could result in the event that we are not fully compliant by the end of o legal risks  including customer  supplier  employee or shareholder lawsuits over failure to deliver contracted services or product failure 
o loss of sales due to failure to meet customer quality expectations or inability to ship products 
o increased operational costs due to manual processing  data corruption or disaster recovery 
o inability to bill or invoice customers and collect payments in a timely manner 
in addition to the year compliance issues we face with respect to our own systems  we face risks that our vendors and or customers systems  which are not directly under our control  may not become compliant prior to january  in addition  if certain public infrastructure interruptions in areas such as utilities electricity  water or telephone  transportation  banking or government  result in a disruption of our service  our operations at individual facilities could be impacted for the duration of the disruption 
as companies shift their information technology budgets toward year compliance requirements  it is possible that a reduction in spending for telecommunications equipment could occur in because we market our products principally to telephone companies in the united states and canada  a reduction in telecommunications equipment spending could reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our contingency plans a contingency plan has not yet been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to our year compliance  and such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
it is impossible to fully assess the potential consequences in the event service interruptions from suppliers occur or in the event that there are disruptions in such infrastructure areas as utilities  communications  transportation  banking and government 
assuming no major public infrastructure service disruption occurs  we believe that we will be able to manage our year transition without a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we have not completed contingency plans in the event that a disruption in the public infrastructure does occur 
the above information is based upon management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates can be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected programs  the rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs  and the success of our external customers  suppliers and governmental agencies in addressing the year issue 
the above discussion regarding year contains many statements that are forward looking within the meaning of the reform act 
when used in the year discussion  the words believes  expects  estimates  planned  could and similar expression are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements included  without limitation  our expectations as to when we will complete the remediation and testing phases of our year plan as well as any contingency plans we formulate  our estimated cost of achieving year readiness  and our belief that our internal systems and equipment will be year compliant in a timely manner

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus  plus or plus basis points over a month time horizon 
the market value changes for a  or basis point increase in short term treasury security yields were not material due to the overall short term maturity of our portfolio 
as of december   the weighted average maturity of our portfolio is days 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum average maturity of our overall investment portfolio is limited by policy to months 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to one issue  issuer  as well as the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines  the exposure to market and credit risk is not expected to be material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk
