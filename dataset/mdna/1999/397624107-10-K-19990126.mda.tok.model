and 
per share for the class a and class b common stock  respectively 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the increase in net income  excluding the effect of the restructuring charges  was due primarily to improved operating profits for the containerboard segment resulting from higher average paper prices over the prior year 
in addition  the acquisition of the industrial containers business of sonoco and several timberland sales contributed to the improvement in net income

the company s industrial shipping containers segment  where packages manufactured by the company are purchased by other manufacturers and suppliers  is substantially subject to the general economic conditions and business success of the company s customers 
similarly  the company s containerboard segment is subject to the general economic conditions and the effect of the operating rates of the containerboard industry  including pricing pressures from its competitors

the containerboard segment had a slight increase in net sales in as compared to excess capacity in the containerboard market caused sales prices for containerboard and related products to be lower 
in fact  paper prices reached a year low in may this reduction in sales prices from the company s paper mills was partially offset by an increase in sales volume in as compared to in addition  the sale of the wood components plants caused a decrease in sales since the prior year

operating profit during  the increase in operating profit of million was due primarily to an improvement in gross profit margin of this year compared to last year 
this increase was caused by higher sales prices per unit in the containerboard segment without a corresponding increase in the cost of products sold 
in addition  the inclusion of the industrial containers business of sonoco contributed to this increase 
the increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses included in both segments over the prior year 
the higher selling  general and administrative expenses were due primarily to additional expenses related to the industrial containers business of sonoco  prior year acquisitions and amortization of goodwill 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the operating profit of the industrial shipping containers segment was million or of net sales in as compared to million or of net sales in price pressures on its products affected the operating profits of this segment

these contributions are expected to begin in the latter part of  however  the most significant impact will not be realized until the end of after the plan has been fully implemented 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during  the company adopted a plan to consolidate its operations which included the relocation of certain key operating employees  the realignment of some of its administrative functions and the reduction of certain support functions 
as a result  there was a charge to income of million during the fourth quarter of as of october   all expenditures related to the charge have been made and the liability accordingly eliminated

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income before income taxes decreased million in as compared to the prior year due primarily to less favorable gross profit margins in the containerboard segment than in in addition  there was a million restructuring charge and a million increase in interest expense 
the million of higher timber sales and million of gains on the sale of certain facilities offset these reductions 
income taxes the company anticipates that it will be able to fully realize its recognized deferred tax assets based upon its projected taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources as indicated in the consolidated balance sheets  elsewhere in this report and in the financial data set forth above  the company is dedicated to maintaining a strong financial position 
it is management s belief that this dedication is extremely important during all economic times 
the company s financial strength is important to continue to achieve the following goals a 
to protect the assets of the company and the intrinsic value of shareholders equity in periods of adverse economic conditions 
b 
to respond to any large and presently unanticipated cash demands that might result from future adverse events 
c 
to be able to benefit from new developments  new products and new opportunities in order to achieve the best results for our shareholders 
d 
to continue to pay competitive remuneration  including the ever increasing costs of employee benefits  to company employees who produce the results for the company s shareholders 
e 
to replace and improve plants and equipment 
when plants and production machinery must be replaced  either because of wear or to obtain the cost reducing potential of technological improvement required to remain a low cost producer in the highly competitive environment in which the company operates  the cost of new plants and machinery are often significantly higher than the historical cost of the items being replaced

during the last three years  the company has invested million in capital additions and acquisitions 
these investments are an indication of the company s commitment to be the quality  low cost producer and the desirable long term supplier to all of our customers 
management believes that the present financial strength of the company will be sufficient to achieve these goals 
on march   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the industrial containers business of sonoco for approximately million in cash 
the industrial containers business includes twelve fibre drum plants and five plastic drum plants along with facilities for research and development  packaging services and distribution

as discussed in prior annual reports  the company s paper mill in virginia made significant improvements to its facilities by adding a new woodyard and a manufacturing control system 
the company s paper mill in ohio made significant improvements to its machinery and equipment 
in addition  a new sheet feeder plant in michigan was completed during november the company purchased two corrugated container companies  decatur container corporation and kyowva corrugated container company  inc during the purchase of the industrial containers business of sonoco has been the primary reason for the increase in accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill  property  plant and equipment and accounts payable since october item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the increase in the restructuring reserve is primarily due to the recording of a restructuring charge of million  as discussed above  during the third quarter of the remaining increase is due to a restructuring reserve that was set up for certain sonoco locations  purchased on march   that will be closed 
these amounts primarily relate to severance arrangements and other costs of closing the plants 
during  the company entered into a credit agreement which provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million 
the company has borrowed money under the credit facility to purchase the industrial containers business of sonoco and repay the other long term obligations of the company 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants including maintaining a certain leverage ratio  sufficient coverage of interest expense and a minimum net worth 
in addition  the company is limited with respect to additional debt 
finally  there are certain non financial covenants including sales of assets  financial reporting  mergers and acquisitions  investments  change in control and employee retirement income security act compliance 
the increase in other long term liabilities is primarily the result of the postretirement health care benefits related to certain employees of the acquired businesses of sonoco 
various lawsuits  claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against the company  including those pertaining to environmental  product liability  safety and health matters 
while the amounts claimed may be substantial  the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist 
therefore  it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies 
however  based upon the facts currently available  management believes that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a materially adverse affect on the financial position of the company 
during  the company embarked on a program to implement a new management information system 
the purpose of the new management information system is to focus on using information technology to link operations in order to become a low cost producer and more effectively service the company s customers 
the ultimate cost of this project is dependent upon management s final determination of the locations  timing and extent of integration of the new management information system 
as of october   the company has spent approximately million towards this project 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition to the intermediate bulk containers business of sonoco and the new management information system  as described above  the company has approved future purchases of approximately million 
these purchases are primarily to replace and improve equipment 
borrowing and self financing have been the primary sources for past capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the company anticipates financing future capital expenditures in a like manner and believes that it will have adequate funds available for planned expenditures 
on november   a joint venture named corrchoice was formed to operate the sheet feeder plants of michigan packaging  a subsidiary of the company  and ohio packaging 
the joint venture was formed by the stockholders of michigan packaging and ohio packaging contributing their stock in these companies to corrchoice in exchange for stock of corrchoice

the company manufactures spiral cores at three of its canadian locations 
abzac manufacturers fibre drums at three of its locations in france 
the transaction is subject to due diligence and is anticipated to be completed during the third quarter of year matters historically  certain information technology it systems of the company have used two digits rather than four digits to define that applicable year  which could result in recognizing a date using as the year rather than the year it systems include computer software and hardware in the mainframe  midrange and desktop environments as well as telecommunications 
additionally  the impact of the problem extends to non it systems  such as automated plant systems and instrumentation 
the year issues could result in major failures or misclassifications 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company is actively assessing the year readiness of its it and non it systems  and has begun to remediate certain it systems 
in addition  the company is in the process of determining the extent to which the systems of third parties with whom the company has significant relationships may be vulnerable to year issues and what impact  if any  these year issues will have on the company 
as part of these assessments  a compliance plan  which includes the formation of a steering committee and a timetable for identifying  evaluating  resolving and testing its year issues  has been developed 
the steering committee includes members of the company s senior management and internal audit department to ensure that the issues are adequately addressed and completed in a timely manner 
the timetable provides for the company s completion of its remediation of any year issues by the end of according to the compliance plan  the inventory and assessment phase related to the company s it and non it systems are expected to be complete by the end of the second quarter of further  corrections and testing of critical year issues are expected to be complete by the end of the third quarter of for non critical year issues  corrections and testing are expected to be complete by the end of the fourth quarter of while it is difficult  at present  to fully quantify the overall cost of this work  the company currently estimates its total spending for year remediation efforts to be approximately million to million 
the range is a function of ongoing evaluation as to whether certain systems and equipment will be corrected or replaced  which is largely dependent on information to be obtained from suppliers or other external sources 
this amount will primarily be expended during costs for system maintenance and modification are expensed as incurred while spending for new hardware  software or equipment will be capitalized and depreciated over the assets useful lives 
the company anticipates funding its year expenditures out of its cash flows from operations 
as of october   approximately  has been spent related to this effort 
the company anticipates timely completion of its year remediation 
however  if the company does not become year compliant on a timely basis  there could be adverse financial and operational effects on the company 
the amount of these effects can not be ascertained at this time 
the year steering committee is continuously reviewing the status of the company s remediation efforts and  as a necessary part of the compliance plan discussed above  a contingency plan will be created during the plan will address alternative solutions to the company s year issues

forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results statements contained in this form k or any other reports or documents prepared by the company or made by management of the company may be forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s operating results to differ materially from those projected 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual financial performance 
changes in general economic conditions 
the company s customers generally consist of other manufacturers and suppliers who purchase the company s industrial shipping containers and containerboard for their own containment and shipping purposes 
because the company supplies a cross section of many industries  such as chemicals  food products  petroleum products  pharmaceuticals  and metal products  demand for the company s industrial shipping containers and containerboard and related corrugated products has historically corresponded to changes in general economic conditions of the united states  canada and mexico 
accordingly  the company s financial performance is substantially dependent upon the general economic conditions existing in the united states  canada and mexico 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued competition 
the company s business of manufacturing and selling industrial shipping containers and containerboard is highly competitive 
the most important competitive factors are price  quality and service 
many of the company s competitors are substantially larger and have significantly greater financial resources 
excess capacity in containerboard segment 
industry demand for containerboard products has declined in recent years causing excess capacity in this segment of the company s business 
this excess capacity has in turn caused lower sales prices in the containerboard market  evidenced by paper prices reaching a year low in may these excess capacity levels and competitive pricing pressures in the containerboard market have negatively impacted the company s financial performance in recent years 
management does not anticipate that paper prices will be as favorable in as in  which could negatively impact the company s net sales and operating profits 
raw material shortages 
the company s raw materials are principally pulpwood  waste paper for recycling  paper  steel and resins 
certain of these materials have been  and in the future may be  in short supply 
shortages in raw materials could adversely affect the company s operations 
failure of year compliance 
the company is actively assessing its year readiness  including the extent to which third parties with whom the company has significant relationships may be vulnerable to year issues and what impact  if any  these year issues will have on the company 
as part of these assessments  a compliance plan  which includes the formation of a steering committee and a timetable for identifying  evaluating  resolving and testing its year issues  has been developed 
the company anticipates timely completion of its year remediation by the end of however  the failure to become year compliant on a timely basis could have a material adverse affect on the company s operations and financial performance 
the year steering committee is continuously reviewing the status of the company s remediation efforts and  as a necessary part of the compliance plan discussed above  a contingency plan will be created during to address alternative solutions to the company s year issues 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concluded environmental and health and safety matters  product liability claims 
the company must comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding federal  state and local environmental matters  such as air and water quality and waste disposal 
the company must also comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding safety and health matters 
the failure to materially comply with such rules and regulations could adversely affect the company s operations 
furthermore  litigation or claims against the company with respect to such matters could adversely affect the company s financial performance 
the company may also become subject to product liability claims which could adversely affect the company 
risks associated with acquisitions 
during the past several years the company has invested  and for the foreseeable future the company anticipates investing  a substantial amount of capital in acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the failure to retain key employees and contracts and the inability to integrate businesses without material disruption 
in addition  other companies in the company s industries have similar acquisition strategies 
there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the company s operations  that competition for acquisitions will not intensify or that the company will be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions 
in addition  the costs of unsuccessful acquisition efforts may adversely affect the company s financial performance 
timberland sales 
the company has a significant inventory of standing timber and timberlands 
the frequency and volume of sales of timber and timberland will have an effect on the company s financial performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concluded 
fn 
c the average receive rate is based upon the libor rate at october  the rates presented are not intended to project the company s expectations for the future 
foreign currency risk the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on its financial instruments is not material because most of these instruments are denominated in us dollars
