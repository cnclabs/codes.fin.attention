item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in july  when the management  in partnership with em warburg  pincus co  llc  purchased certain assets and liabilities of litton industries integrated automation division  a leading system integrator with a primary focus on the aerospace industry and secondary focus on the financial services and transportation industries 
following this acquisition  we began our transition from a system integrator and a provider of software development services to a developer of application software solutions 
we decided to de emphasize the aerospace market  to develop our enterprise transaction management platform into a stand alone software product  and to build a series of software application frameworks based upon our complex enterprise transaction management platform targeted initially to the financial services industry 
through  a majority of our total revenues were derived from large application development contracts 
our objective was to increase the portion of our total revenue derived from application software solutions sales 
we were able to increase the amount of software license revenue in and in  but suffered a significant decline in we believe this was primarily due to a much smaller available market for our existing application frameworks than originally expected  and that new application frameworks must be introduced in and subsequent years in order to substantially increase revenues 
our revenues declined from million in to million in also in  we recorded a net loss of million as compared to a net income of  in these results were caused by delays in implementation of our remitvision application framework  and by the limited market potential of our checkvision and remitvision application frameworks 
these products are affordable only by the top us banks  and our check archive is still in the early adopter phase by these banks 
the market is also consolidating and is focused on solving the year problem 
we believe these issues have put severe constraints on resources available within the banking industry to successfully implement our offerings 
we believe our technology and expertise apply to a broader sector of financial services  such as brokerage  mutual funds  insurance and credit card sectors 
although we have successfully completed installations at both fidelity investments and merrill lynch  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these markets  nor can there be any assurance as to the timing of this success 
we currently sell four application frameworks  checkvision  remitvision  a loan operations application framework and statementvision  which are built upon our enterprise transaction management platform 
checkvision is designed to maximize the value of archived transaction information over the entire useful life of such information  and remitvision is designed to provide banks and other remittance processors with the ability to combine high volume consumer payment activity with complex accounts receivable processing in one production environment 
the loan operations application framework uses workflow  imaging  and intranet technology to enable a bank to more quickly  efficiently  and accurately to initiate a new consumer or installment this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual results will meet the company s current expectations due to factors described in this annual report on form k  including those factors contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors 
loan 
statementvision enables financial services firms to efficiently manage  store  and distribute computer generated reports and print formatted documents such as customer statements 
our application software solutions are comprised of a core software product plus customization and installation services provided around the core product 
we have also invested in growing the sales and marketing organization to sell our software solutions 
at the same time  we have continued to develop specific software solutions under application development contracts for customers primarily in the financial services industry  which we believe  may be the basis for future application frameworks 
we plan to release in early our new statementvision application framework  which is based on a large application development contract 
there can be no assurance that this new application framework will generate additional revenues 
during the transition from providing software development services to developing and selling application software solutions  a majority of our total revenues has been derived from the provision of services to customers pursuant to large software development contracts  certain of which provide the basis for our application frameworks 
we recognize revenue from software development contracts on the percentage of completion basis 
service revenue as a percentage of total revenue for  and was  and  respectively 
in addition  we have transitioned out of selling hardware 
due in part to these transitions  in part to delays in our remitvision application framework  and in part to fewer sales in  we experienced a decline in total revenue in and a significant decline in total revenue in to achieve revenue growth and improve operating margins  we must increase market acceptance and sales of our application software solutions and introduce new application frameworks to expand our market appeal within the financial services industry 
we must develop and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities  software development estimation  production and distribution infrastructure as we continue the transition from a pure service provider business to an application solutions business 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in creating the necessary capabilities and infrastructure 
any significant failure by us to manage the transition successfully has had and would continue to have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition and would continue to create significant fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
installation of our application software solutions is  in part  dependent upon certain customer responsibilities 
to the extent the customer activities are delayed  the installation of our application software may be delayed  which may result in a delay in revenue recognition  which could continue to have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  we have experienced product installation delays which have resulted in us having lower than expected revenue and profits from remitvision customers in the quarters ended june  september and december  and for each quarter of the failure to resolve similar situations in the future could continue to have an adverse affect on our operating results and could adversely affect our ability to market its solutions 
our total revenues are derived from software licenses  services and maintenance 
we license software to end users under non cancelable license agreements and provide services such as customization  installation  training and software maintenance 
software license and service revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of incurred costs to total estimated costs 
actual costs and gross margins on such contracts have and could continue to differ from our estimates for a variety of reasons  including delays in the installation of our application software solutions or greater than anticipated contract costs  and such differences could continue to be material to the financial statements 
allowance for future estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements  which in most cases is one year 
we have taken steps to improve the accuracy of our software development and customization estimation process  but there can be no assurance that these measures will improve results 
allowances for future estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized 
see note to notes to financial statements 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million  including a net loss of million in there can be no assurance that we will have operating profits in any future period 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues years ended december  revenues license service maintenance hardware total revenues cost of revenues license service maintenance hardware total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative product development total operating expenses operating income loss interest income expense and other income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss comparison of   and revenues license 
license revenue to date has been primarily derived from sale of licenses of our checkvision  remitvision  and workvision application frameworks 
license revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this decrease in license revenue resulted from a smaller number of sales of our application frameworks  cancellation of purchase decisions arising from the impact of the banking industry mergers and customer preoccupation with year issues 
furthermore  customer imposed implementation and installation delays have delayed revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method 
management believes that we will need to penetrate additional market segments within financial services and expand into new vertical markets in the services industry to achieve license revenue growth  the timing of which is difficult to predict 
service 
service revenue has been comprised primarily of fees from software application development contracts  and to a lesser extent  fees from installation services and training for our checkvision and remitvision application frameworks 
service revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from service revenue in is primarily the result of a smaller number of sales of our application software solutions  customer delays deferring revenue recognition and deferral of expected new contracts 
additionally  the decrease in service revenue is also attributable to the continued transition from providing software development services to developing and selling application software solutions coupled with the completion of the majority of our large application development contracts 
management believes that we will need to penetrate other market segments within financial services and expand into new markets within the services industry to achieve service revenue growth  the timing of which is difficult to predict 
maintenance 
maintenance revenue is generated primarily by software support contracts to customers that have entered into license agreements for the use of our application frameworks 
maintenance support includes telephone support  minor software upgrades and  in some cases  third party support 
maintenance revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
maintenance revenue increased in and due to the growing base of installed checkvision application framework customers resulting in a corresponding increase in demand for maintenance related services  and due to the completion of a large application development contract that entered into maintenance in due to the small number of sales in  we believe that maintenance revenue is unlikely to increase in the short term and may decline 
hardware 
there were no hardware revenues for or after we found alternate hardware distribution channels to support our customers 
hardware revenues for was million 
the hardware revenue in was primarily the result of a large remitvision contract  and to a lesser extent  numerous checkvision contracts for which we were required to act as a reseller of certain hardware required for installation 
previously  we provided hardware to our customers where i the customer did not have a relationship with a particular hardware vendor and direct purchase by the customer would have significantly delayed the installation by us or ii certain hardware required for the operation of our checkvision and or remitvision application frameworks were not available for direct sale to end users 
we have decided to return to being a reseller for certain hardware vendors  and was in the process of signing agreements to do so 
as a result  future revenues may include a hardware component  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reselling hardware  or that any hardware sales will positively affect our operating results 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenue decreased in to  from  in cost of license revenue decreased due to a negotiated decrease in royalties payable to third parties 
the cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue may increase in the future if we negotiate royalty agreements with partners or customers that fund or partially fund future application frameworks 
cost of license revenue as a percentage of license fees was consistent from to service 
cost of service revenue is primarily comprised of employee related costs and fees for third party consultants incurred in providing customization  installation  training and development services 
cost of service revenue was million in  million in and million in  or  and of the related service revenue  respectively 
cost of service revenue decreased in absolute dollars from to primarily due to the decrease in related service revenue and customer delays in installing our application software solutions 
cost of service revenue increased both in and on a percentage basis due both to customer delays and our delays 
although we have taken steps to reduce our cost of service revenue  there can be no assurance these steps will prove effective 
maintenance 
cost of maintenance revenue is primarily comprised of employee related costs incurred in providing customer support and also includes the cost of services provided by third parties for hardware related maintenance for certain of the installed base of customers 
cost of maintenance revenue was million in  million in and million in  or  and  of the related maintenance revenue  respectively 
cost of maintenance revenue increased in from due to maintenance this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual results will meet the company s current expectations due to factors described in this annual report on form k  including those factors contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors 
revenue growth coupled with recently completed software development contracts requiring much higher levels of maintenance labor than previously experienced 
from to  maintenance costs increased due to an increased maintenance demand resulting from an increased checkvision customer base 
although we have taken steps and initiated programs to reduce our cost of maintenance revenue  there can be no assurance these steps and programs will be affective 
hardware 
cost of hardware revenue consisted of direct costs of hardware supplied on behalf of customers 
there was no cost of hardware revenue for and cost of hardware revenue in was million or of related hardware revenue 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales personnel  field offices  travel and related expenses  promotional and advertisement expenses 
sales and marketing expense was million  million and million in  and  or  and  of total revenues  respectively 
sales and marketing expense increased from to primarily due to an expansion of the marketing staff 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense from to was mainly the result of decreased sales commissions 
sales and marketing expenses increased substantially in as a percentage of revenue due to the decrease in revenue coupled with the fact that these expenses are relatively fixed 
we are  however  implementing cost control measures in an effort to manage expense growth  but there can be no assurance these measures will be successful 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense was million in  million in and million in  or  and of total revenues  respectively 
general and administrative expense increased from to due primarily to an increase in executive salary and executive recruiting costs coupled with an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts for certain contracts associated with high collectibility risks 
additionally  stock based compensation expense was recorded for the issuance of stock options to non employees 
general and administrative expenses increased substantially in as a percentage of revenues due to the decrease in revenues coupled with the fact that these expenses are relatively fixed 
general and administrative expense increased from to primarily due to expenses incurred as the result of being a public company 
we are implementing cost control measures in an effort to manage expense growth  but there can be no assurance these measures will be successful 
product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses 
product development expense was million  million and million in  and  or  and of total revenues  respectively 
in and  product development expense increased primarily as a result of increased personnel costs and associated infrastructure costs required to support software development initiatives to enhance and expand our product offerings 
in particular  our development expenditure increase in from were driven by expenditures associated with the unveiling of remitvision release in july  and by expenditures associated with remitvision release over the balance of we may continue to experience increased product development costs associated with product enhancement and new application frameworks  which are  deemed necessary to adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
in particular  to the extent we are required to develop future application frameworks without development contracts  our expenditures for product development may increase 
liquidity and capital resources we completed our initial public offering of common stock on november  raising net proceeds of million 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq national market under the symbol iacp 
this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations  there can be assurance that the company s actual results will meet the company s current expectations due to factors described in this annual report on form k  including those factors contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors 
we used cash of million  million and  for operating activities for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the use of cash from to was primarily the result of cash provided from the decrease in accounts receivable the increase in the use of cash from to was mainly due to a decrease in net income and an increase in accounts receivable 
our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of short term investments and property and equipment 
short term investments purchased and sold in totaled million and million  respectively 
in  short term investments purchased totaled million 
short term investments were not purchased in capital expenditures for were  offset by  by proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
capital expenditures were  and  for and  respectively 
capital expenditures consisted of purchases of computer equipment and office furniture to support our product development needs and year compatibility requirements 
we currently have no significant capital spending requirements or purchase commitments other than a non cancelable operating lease for our facilities 
see note of notes to the financial statements 
cash provided by financing activities of  in was the result of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  cash provided by financing activities of  was comprised of proceeds from purchases of common stock under the employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
the initial public offering of our common stock  and net bank borrowings provided the cash from financing activities in at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
our million bank line of credit agreement expired in july we have decided not to renew the line of credit agreement 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term cash investments  together with expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months 
in the event that such existing and expected resources are not sufficient to fund our operations for the next months  we will need to obtain financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and that such terms may be delutive to our existing stockholders 
our inability to secure necessary funding would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operation 
impact of year our business could be affected by year issues 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the failure of our internal systems to correctly recognize date information when the year changes to could significantly harm our operations 
in assessing the affect of the year issue on the company  we have determined the need to evaluate the following general areas 
internal infrastructure 
supplier relationships 
products sold to customers this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations  there can be assurance that the company s actual results will meet the company s current expectations due to factors described in this annual report on form k  including those factors contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors 
internal infrastructure 
we have assessed our internal systems  including our telecommunication services  climate control  building access and other infrastructual services 
based on our assessment  we have identified necessary modifications to our telecommunications and internal computer systems to make them year compatible 
we expect to implement the telecommunications and computer systems modifications by july  we cannot assure you that our other internal systems contain all necessary software for year compatibility 
supplier relationships 
we have contacted our critical suppliers of products and services to determine that their operations and the products and services they provide to us are year compatible 
we cannot assure you that the failure of one of our suppliers to ensure appropriate year compatibility would not significantly harm our business  operations or financial condition 
products sold to customers 
we have also assessed the capability of our products that we sold to customers 
based on this assessment  we do not expect that contingencies related to the year issue for the products we sold are likely to significantly harm our business 
we cannot assure you  however  that our application software solutions contain all necessary software for year compatibility 
additionally  our products incorporate third party software products which are in turn incorporated into our customers products and internal systems  which we do not develop 
the performance of our application frameworks could be affected if a year issue exists in any different third party software product or a component of a customer s product or internal system 
we have not  and will not  assess the existence of these potential problems in our customers products or internal systems 
if any of our licensees experience year issues  such licensees could assert claims for damages against us 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources  even if ultimately decided in our favor 
in addition  many companies are expending significant resources to correct their software systems for year compatible 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase our application software solutions 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we have not developed a contingency plan to address situations that may result if we are unable to achieve year readiness of our products or critical operations  and we do not plan to do so in the future 
the expected costs associated with respect to year issues is estimated to equal  and are to be funded by our available cash 
we will continue to expend resources to address this issue in the future 
we cannot assure you  however  that the year issue will not have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
market risk disclosures our investments consist primarily of short term money market investments that earn interest at a fixed rate 
all of our cash equivalents at december  have maturity dates of less than days 
we do not believe our exposure to interest rate risk to be material given the short term nature of our investment portfolio
