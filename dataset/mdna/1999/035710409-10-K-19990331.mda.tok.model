item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a real estate investment trust reit which acquires and manages mortgage backed securities which can be readily financed 
the company commenced operations on february  upon the closing of the private placement  which resulted in proceeds to the company of million 
the company received additional proceeds of  upon the closing of the direct offering on july  the company s initial public offering was completed on october  raising net proceeds of million 
during the third quarter of  the company initiated a stock buy back program 
during the year ended december    shares were repurchased at a cost of  stock options exercised during the year ended december  totaled  shares for a aggregate exercise price of  the company s principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to stockholders from the spread between the interest income on its mortgage backed securities and the costs of borrowing to finance its acquisition of mortgage backed securities 
the company will seek to generate growth in earnings and dividends per share in a variety of ways  including through i issuing new common stock and increasing the size of the balance sheet when opportunities in the market for mortgage backed securities are likely to allow growth in earnings per share  ii continually reviewing the mix of mortgage backed security types on the balance sheet in an effort to improve risk adjusted returns  and iii attempting to improve the efficiency of the company s balance sheet structure through the issuance of uncollateralized subordinated debt  preferred stock and other forms of capital  to the extent management deems such issuances appropriate 
results of operations the company s fiscal year commenced with the start of operations on february  the day period from february  to december  is referred to herein as the period ended december  the year ended december  is its calendar equivalent 
net income summary comparing net income for the period february  through december  to the year ended december  may be deceptive 
the day period ended december  is a shortened operating period and not a full twelve months 
also  average assets for the period ended december  totaled million  whereas  average assets for the year ended december  totaled billion 
for the year ended december   net income  as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap  was  or basic earnings per share  as compared to the period ended december  of  or basic earnings per share 
taxable earnings for the year ended december  was approximately  or basic per average share 
taxable income for the period ended december  was  or basic per average share 
net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of outstanding common stock during the period  which was  and  for the year ended december  and the period ended december   respectively 
dividends per weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year ended december  and the period ended december  were per share   in total and per share   in total 
return on average equity was for the year ended december  and for the period ended december  management s policy is to focus on income and expense measures as a percentage of equity rather than as a percentage of assets 
therefore  improvements in asset based measures such as net interest margin or operating expenses as a percentage of assets do not necessarily translate into improved stockholder returns 
improvements in net interest income or operating expenses as a percentage of equity  however  indicate that the company is effectively utilizing its equity capital base 
the company seeks to increase net income as a percentage of equity consistent with its capital investment policy

the differences were in the calculations of premium amortization and general and administrative expenses 
the distinction between taxable income and gaap income is important to the company s stockholders because dividends are declared on the basis of taxable income 
while the company does not pay taxes so long as it satisfies the requirements for exemption from taxation pursuant to the reit provisions of the code  each year the company completes a corporate tax form wherein taxable income is calculated as if the company were to be taxed 
this taxable income level determines the amount of dividends the company can pay out over time 
the table below presents the major differences between gaap and taxable income for the company for the year ended december   the period ended december  and the four quarters in taxable income taxable general taxable mortgage taxable gain on gaap net administrative amortization sale of securities taxable net income differences differences differences income dollars in thousands for the year ended   december  for the period ended december    for the quarter ended   december  for the quarter ended   september  for the quarter ended   june  for the quarter ended   march  interest income and average earning asset yield the company had average earning assets of billion and million for the year ended december  and the period ended december   respectively 
the company s primary source of income for the year ended december  and for the period ended december  was interest income 
a portion of income was generated by gains on sales of mortgage backed securities 
interest income was million and million for the year ended december  and for the period ended december   respectively 
the yield on average earning assets was and  respectively  for the same periods 
the table below shows the company s average balance of cash equivalents and mortgage backed securities  the yields earned on each type of earning assets  the yield on average earning assets and interest income for the year ended december   the period ended december  and the four quarters in yields on interest earning assets declined for the year ended december  from the period ended december  as previously mentioned  the average asset balance increased substantially for the year ended december  and the result is increased net interest income  even though the yield decreased 
average earning asset yield yield on average average amortized amortized cost cost of yield on average of mortgage average yield on mortgage average cash backed earning average cash backed earning interest equivalents securities assets equivalents securities assets income dollars in thousands for the year ended december     for the period ended december     for the quarter ended december     for the quarter ended september     for the quarter ended june     for the quarter ended march     the constant prepayment rate or cpr on the company s portfolio of mortgage backed securities for the year ended december  and for the period ended december  was and  respectively 
the increase in the prepayment rate is reflected in the decline in yield on the average interest earning assets for the year ended december  from the period ended december  cpr means an assumed rate of prepayment for the company s mortgage backed securities  expressed as an annual rate of prepayment relative to the outstanding principal balance of the company s mortgage backed securities 
this cpr does not purport to be either a historical description of the prepayment experience of the company s mortgage backed securities or a prediction of the anticipated rate of prepayment of the company s mortgage backed securities 
since a large portion of the company s assets was purchased at a premium to par value and only a small portion of the company s assets was purchased at a discount to par value  the premium balance in the company s portfolio is substantially higher than the discount balance 
principal prepayments had a negative effect on the company s earning asset yield for the year ended december  and the period ended december  because the company adjusts its rates of premium amortization and discount accretion monthly based upon the effective yield method  which takes into consideration changes in prepayment speeds 
interest expense and the cost of funds the company anticipates that its largest expense will usually be the cost of borrowed funds 
the company had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of million for the year ended december  average borrowed funds for the period ended december  was million and the interest expense for the period was million 
the average cost of funds was and for the year ended december  and the period ended december   respectively 
interest expense is calculated in the same manner for gaap and tax purposes 
even though the cost of funds rate declined for the year ended december   interest expense increased because of the increase in the average repurchase balance to billion 
with the company s current asset liability management strategy  changes in the company s cost of funds are expected to be closely correlated with changes in short term libor  although the company may choose to extend the maturity of its liabilities at any time 
the company s average cost of funds was equal to the average one month libor for the year ended december  the company s average cost of funds was below one month libor for the period ended december  the company generally has structured its borrowings to adjust with one month libor 
during the year ended december   average one month libor  which was  was higher than average six month libor  which was 
during the period ended december   average one month libor  which was was lower than average six month libor  which was the table below shows the company s average borrowed funds and average cost of funds as compared to average one and six month libor for the year ended december   the period ended december  and the four quarters in average cost of funds average one average cost average month libor of funds average cost of average average one average relative to relative to funds relative borrowed interest cost of month six month average six average one to average six funds expense funds libor libor month libor month libor month libor for the year ended december    for the period ended december    for the quarter ended december    for the quarter ended september    for the quarter ended june    for the quarter ended march    net interest rate agreement expense the company has not entered into any interest rate agreements to date 
as part of its asset liability management process  the company may enter into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps  floors and swaps 
these agreements would be entered into to reduce interest rate or prepayment risk and would be designed to provide income and capital appreciation to the company in the event of certain changes in interest rates 
however  even after entering into such agreements  the company would still be exposed to interest rate and prepayment risks 
the company reviews the need for interest rate agreements on a regular basis consistent with its capital investment policy 
net interest income net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense  totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the period ended december  net interest spread  which equals the yield on the company s average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was for the year ended december  and for the period ended december  net interest margin  which equals net interest income divided by average total assets  was for the year ended december  and on an annualized basis for the period ended december  even though the interest rate spread and the net interest margin declined from the previous year  net interest income increased due to the increased asset size 
taxable net interest income was approximately  greater than gaap net interest income because of differing premium and discount amortization  for the year ended december  taxable net interest income was  less than gaap net interest income because of differing premium and discount amortization  for the period ended december  the principal reason that annualized net interest margin exceeded net interest spread is that average assets exceeded average liabilities 
a portion of the company s assets is funded with equity rather than borrowings 
the company did not have any interest rate agreement expense for the year ended december  or for the period ended december  the table below shows interest income by earning asset type  average earning assets by type  total interest income  yield on average interest earning assets  average repurchase agreements  interest expense  average cost of funds  and net interest income for the year ended december   the period ended december   and the four quarters in gaap net interest income dollars in thousands average amortized cost of interest yield on mortgage income on interest average average backed mortgage average income on total interest balance of securities backed cash cash interest farming repurchase held securities equivalents equivalents income assets agreements for the year ended december      for the period ended december      for the quarter ended december      for the quarter ended september      for the quarter ended june      for the quarter ended march      average net interest cost of interest expense funds income for the year ended december    for the period ended december    for the quarter ended december    for the quarter ended september    for the quarter ended june    for the quarter ended march    gains and losses on sales of mortgage backed securities for the year ended december   the company sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of million for an aggregate gain of million 
during the period ended december  the company sold mortgage backed securities with a historical amortized cost of million for an aggregate gain of  taxable net gains were approximately  less than gaap gains losses on sale of securities for the year ended december  and  greater for the period ended december  the difference between the sale price and the historical amortized cost of the mortgage backed securities is a realized gain and increased income accordingly 
the company does not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis  but may from time to time sell existing assets to move into new assets which management believes might have higher risk adjusted returns or to manage its balance sheet as part of management s asset liability management strategy 
credit expenses the company has not experienced credit losses on its portfolio of mortgage backed securities to date  but losses may be experienced in the future 
at december  and  the company had limited its exposure to credit losses on its portfolio of mortgage backed securities by purchasing only securities  issued or guaranteed by fnma  fhlmc or gnma agency certificates  which  although not rated  carry an implied aaa rating 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses operating expense or g a expense were million for the year ended december  and  for the period ended december  taxable g a expenses were approximately  and  less than for gaap purposes for the year ended december  and the period ended december   respectively 
even though g a expense increased in total from the period ended december  to the year ended december   g a expense as a percentage of assets declined to from 
the company experienced economies of scale with the increasing asset base and because it is internally managed 
also  it intends to continue to be a low cost provider

accordingly  the company intends to distribute substantially all of its taxable income for each year to stockholders  including income resulting from gains on sales of mortgage backed securities

all of the mortgage assets underlying such mortgage backed securities were secured with a first lien position with respect to the underlying single family properties 
at december  and  all the company s mortgage backed securities were agency certificates  which  although not rated  carry an implied aaa rating 
all of the company s earning assets are marked to market at liquidation value 
discount balances are accreted as an increase in interest income over the life of discount mortgage backed securities and premium balances are amortized as a decrease in interest income over the life of premium mortgage backed securities 
at december  and  the company had on its balance sheet a total of  and  respectively  of unamortized discount which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current historical amortized cost of mortgage backed securities acquired at a price below principal value and a total of million and million  respectively  of unamortized premium which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current historical amortized cost of mortgage backed securities acquired at a price above principal value 
mortgage principal repayments received were million and million for the year ended december  and for the period ended december   respectively 
given the company s current portfolio composition  if mortgage principal prepayment rates increase over the life of the mortgage backed securities comprising the current portfolio  all other factors being equal  the company s net interest income should decrease during the life of such mortgage backed securities as the company will be required to amortize its net premium balance into income over a shorter time period 
similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates decrease over the life of such mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  the company s net interest income should increase during the life of such mortgage backed securities as the company will amortize its net premium balance over a longer time period

at december  and  there were no interest rate agreements on the company s balance sheet 
no interest rate agreements have been entered into since inception of the company 
borrowings to date  the company s debt has consisted entirely of borrowings collateralized by a pledge of the company s mortgage backed securities 
these borrowings appear on the balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
at december   the company had established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market with twenty three lenders in amounts  which the company believes  are in excess of its needs 
all of the company s mortgage backed securities are currently accepted as collateral for such borrowings 
the company  however  limits its borrowings  and thus its potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity while increasing the liquidity and strength of its balance sheet 
for the year ended december  and for the period ended december   the term to maturity of the company s borrowings has ranged from one day to one year  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days and days  respectively 
the weighted average remaining maturity was days and days at december   and  respectively 
many of the company s borrowings have a cost of funds which adjust monthly based on a fixed spread over or under one month libor or based on the daily fed funds rate 
as a result  the average term to the next rate adjustment for the company s borrowings is typically shorter than the term to maturity for the company s mortgage backed securities 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of the company s borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all the company s borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
liquidity liquidity  which is the company s ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows the company to purchase additional mortgage backed securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for the company include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of the company s mortgage backed securities varies 
the company s balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should the company s needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity  plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  management believes that the company s mortgage backed securities could in most circumstances be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of the company s capital investment policy 
under this policy  asset growth is limited in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
stockholders equity the company uses available for sale treatment for its mortgage backed securities  these assets are carried on the balance sheet at estimated market value rather than historical amortized cost 
based upon such available for sale treatment  the company s equity base at december  was million  or per share 
if the company had used historical amortized cost accounting  the company s equity base at december  would have been million  or per share 
the company s equity base at december  was million  or per share 
under the historical amortized cost  the equity base at december  would have been million  or 
the decline in book value from to is primarily due to the change in the market value of the investment portfolio 
the change had a million negative impact on the book value of the company from december  to december  this change reflects the disarray that was prevalent in the fourth quarter in the fixed income markets 
these conditions led to multiple easings of monetary policy by the federal reserve bank 
since the company classifies all investment securities as available for sale  the entire portfolio is recorded daily at market value  and is measured quarterly by the average price provided by three independent sources 
with the company s available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on the balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and reflecting the change in stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income 
by accounting for its assets in this manner  the company hopes to provide useful information to stockholders and creditors and to preserve flexibility to sell assets in the future without having to change accounting methods 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  the book value and book value per share of the company are likely to fluctuate far more than if the company used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may be misleading 
unrealized changes in the estimated net market value of mortgage backed securities have one direct effect on the company s potential earnings and dividends positive market to market changes will increase the company s equity base and allow the company to increase its borrowing capacity while negative changes will tend to limit borrowing capacity under the company s capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of the company s mortgage backed securities might impair the company s liquidity position  requiring the company to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
net unrealized losses on assets available for sale was million  or of the amortized cost of mortgage backed securities  at december  net unrealized gain on assets available for sale was million  or of the amortized cost of mortgage backed securities  at december  the table below shows the company s equity capital base as reported and on a historical amortized cost basis at december  and  september   june   and march  issuances of common stock  the level of gaap earnings as compared to dividends declared  and other factors influence the historical cost equity capital base 
the gaap reported equity capital base is influenced by these factors plus changes in the net unrealized gains losses on assets available for sale account 
stockholders equity net unrealized gaap historical gains losses on reported historical gaap reported amortized cost assets available equity base amortized cost equity book value equity base for sale book value equity per share per share dollars in thousands  except per share data at december     at december     at september     at june     at march     leverage the company s debt to gaap reported equity ratio at december  and was and  respectively 
the company generally expects to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary from time to time based upon various factors  including management s opinion of the level of risk of its assets and liabilities  the company s liquidity position  the level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when the company pledges assets to secure borrowings 
the target debt to gaap reported equity ratio is determined under the company s capital investment policy 
should the actual debt to equity ratio of the company increase above the target level due to asset acquisition and or market value fluctuations in assets  management will cease to acquire new assets 
management will  at such time  present a plan to its board of directors to bring the company back to its target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished in time by the monthly reduction of the balance of mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates management continually reviews the company s asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
the company seeks attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
the company seeks to manage the extent to which net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  although it has not done so to date  the company may seek to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in its portfolio of mortgage backed securities by entering into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps 
changes in interest rates may also have an effect on the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
the company seeks to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate from an economic point of view by balancing assets purchased at a premium with assets purchased at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on mortgage backed securities in the company s portfolio 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce the company s net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
status of year compliance the company has made an ongoing effort to stay abreast of the year compliance issue 
hardware and software was checked for compliance and necessary upgrades were completed 
in consideration of the year issues  the company has reviewed the ability of its own computers and computer programs to properly recognize and handle dates in the year through the normal upgrading of computer equipment  the company has already replaced all computers that were not year compliant 
the company has also reviewed all the date fields embedded in its internally developed spreadsheets  databases and other programs and has determined that all such programs are using four digit years in references to dates 
therefore  the company believes that all of its equipment and internal systems are ready for the year to date  the company has incurred minimal costs in order to be year compliant 
the company believes that most of its exposure to year issues involves the readiness of third parties 
each third party is subject to the year issue 
the company is in the process of surveying pertinent third parties for their compliance 
as a result of communications with such third parties  the company believes that they are spending the appropriate and necessary resources to try to identify year issues and to resolve them or to mitigate the impact of them to the best of their ability as they are identified 
inflation virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive the company s performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and the company s dividends are determined by the company s net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  the company s activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters the company calculated its qualified reit assets  as defined in the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  to be of its total assets at december  and  as compared to the code requirement that at least of its total assets must be qualified reit assets 
the company also calculates that and of its revenue qualifies for the source of income test and of its revenue qualifies for the source of income test under the reit rules for the year ended december  and the period ended december   respectively 
the company also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of its common stock and the distributions of its net income 
therefore  as of december  and  the company believes that it qualified as a reit under the provisions of the code 
the company at all times intends to conduct its business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of if the company were to become regulated as an investment company  then the company s use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation of the staff of the commission  in order to qualify for this exemption  the company must maintain at least of its assets directly in qualifying interests 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securitites represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  such mortgage securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
as of december  and  the company calculates that it is in compliance with this requirement 
item 
a quantitative and qualitiative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the company s net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of the company s mortgage backed securities and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and  indeed  that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
currently  hedging instruments have not been purchased by the company 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
net portfolio value is defined as interest earning assets net of interest bearing liabilities 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in projected percentage change in change in interest rate net interest income net portfolio value basis points basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap  which is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except i adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature  ii fixed rate mortgage related securities reflect estimated prepayments  which were estimated based on analyses of broker estimates  the results of a prepayment model utilized by the company and empirical data  iii non performing discount loans reflect the estimated timing of resolutions which result in repayment to the company and iv fixed rate loans reflect scheduled contractual amortization  with no estimated prepayment
