item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenues in were million versus revenues of million 
total revenues were comprised principally of base and percentage rent of million and ff e reserve income of million in versus million and million  respectively  in the period 
during we received percentage rent of million versus million in the increase in base rent revenue reflects the full year impact of hotels acquired in and the partial impact of hotels acquired during the increases in percentage rent revenue of and ff e reserve income of result from the impact of additional hotels owned as well as increased gross hotel revenues at our hotels 
total expenses in were million versus million in the increase is the result of increases in depreciation and amortization  interest  and general and administrative expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of new investments since january  interest expense in increased primarily as a result of an increase in the average daily balance of indebtedness outstanding 
this increase in average daily balance was due to three separate issuances of senior debt in february million at  november million at and december million at and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
net income in was million share versus million per share in the increase in net income is primarily a result of an increase in revenue from new investments offset by the extraordinary loss of million recognized from the early extinguishment of debt 
funds from operations ffo  defined as net income before extraordinary and non recurring items plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus those deposits made into ff e reserve escrows which are not included in revenue and cash available for distribution cad  defined as ffo less ff e reserve plus amortization of deferred financing costs and other non cash charges related to were million per share and million per share  respectively 
ffo and cad were million per share and million per share  respectively  in growth in ffo and cad is primarily related to the effects of acquisitions in and cash flow provided by used for operating  investing and financing activities was million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  cash flow from operations in increased from million in primarily due to the impact of new investments in and cash used in investing activities and provided by financing activities increased in over levels primarily because of investments in hotels in versus hotels in our total assets increased to  million as of december  from  million as of december  the increase resulted primarily from hotel acquisitions completed in year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenues in were million versus revenues of million 
total revenues were comprised principally of base and percentage rent of million and ff e reserve income of million in versus million and million  respectively  in the period 
our results are reflective of the full year impact of hotels acquired in and the partial year impact of hotels acquired during during we received percentage rent of million versus million in  a increase  as a result of increases in gross hotel revenues at our hotels 
ff e reserve income increased by as a result of additional hotels owned and increased gross hotel revenues at our hotels 
total expenses in were million including interest expense and depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of and million  respectively versus expenses of million including interest expense and depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively 
certain of the hotels purchased in were initially financed with proceeds from our secured line of credit which was ultimately repaid with the proceeds of our  common share offering in december line of credit borrowings  plus the prepayable mortgage notes issued by our subsidiaries  gave rise to interest expense of million in versus million in when amounts outstanding under our line of credit were smaller  were outstanding for shorter periods and during which our mortgage notes were not outstanding for the entire period 
the substantial increase in the number of hotels owned by us also proportionately increased our general expense levels  including depreciation and general and administrative expenses 
we incurred  of costs in in connection with a terminated acquisition effort 
net income in was million versus million in growth in net income is primarily related to the effects of acquisitions in and ffo and cad related to were million per share and million per share  respectively  versus ffo and cad of million per share and million per share  respectively  in growth in ffo and cad is primarily the result of acquisitions in and cash flow provided by used for operating  investing and financing activities was million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  cash flow from operations in increased from million in primarily due to the impact of new investments in and cash used in investing activities and provided by financing activities decreased in from levels primarily because of investments in hotels in versus hotels in our assets increased to  million as of december  from million as of december  the increase resulted primarily from hotel acquisitions completed in liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash to fund distributions  interest and day to day operations is the base and percentage rent we receive 
base rent is paid monthly in advance and percentage rent is paid either monthly or quarterly in arrears 
this flow of funds from rent has historically been sufficient for us to pay distributions  interest and meet day to day operating expenses 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  interest and distribution payments 
in order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate occasional cash needs which may result from timing differences between the receipt of rents and the need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we have entered into a revolving credit facility agreement with a group of commercial banks 
the credit facility is for up to million  all of which was available at december  drawings under the credit facility are unsecured 
funds may be drawn  repaid and redrawn until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
the credit facility matures in march interest on borrowings under the credit facility are payable until maturity at a spread above libor 
at the end of  certain of our properties were encumbered by million of mortgage debt secured notes and our revolving credit facility was secured by mortgages on other properties 
in february  we prepaid all of our secured obligations and now have no secured debt outstanding 
in february we issued million of senior unsecured notes due net proceeds to us of approximately million were used for general business purposes and  on march  to repay the secured notes in full 
during february and april  we sold million common shares in offerings to five unit investment trusts sponsored by certain investment banks 
these offerings raised a total of million of gross proceeds million net after underwriters discounts 
the proceeds were used for the acquisition of additional hotels and for general business purposes 
during november  we sold million common shares  raising million of gross proceeds million net after underwriters discount 
the proceeds were used to repay a portion of our credit facility and for general business purposes 
during november and december  we issued million of unsecured monthly income senior notes due and million of unsecured monthly income senior notes due the million aggregate net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay a portion of our credit facility  for the acquisition of additional hotels and for general business purposes 
we expect to use existing cash balances  borrowings under our credit facility or other lines of credit and or net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future hotel acquisitions 
to the extent we borrow on the credit facility  we will explore various alternatives in both the timing and method of repayment of such amounts 
such alternatives may include incurring long term debt 
on january   our shelf registration statement for up to billion of securities  including debt securities  was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
an effective shelf registration statement enables us to issue specific securities to the public on an expedited basis by filing a prospectus supplement with the sec 
we have billion available on our shelf registration statement as of december  at december  we had total commitments to purchase properties for million  declared but unpaid dividends of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and the ability to draw up to the full amount million under our credit facility 
although there can be no assurance that we will consummate any debt or equity security offerings or other financings  we believe we will have access to various types of financing in the future  including debt or equity securities offerings  with which to finance future acquisitions 
recent developments since december   we have acquired nine of the hotels we were committed to purchase for million 
we expect to acquire the remaining seven throughout  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions by the sellers of such properties 
in february we agreed to and purchased hotels from homestead village incorporated for million 
property leases as of march  we own or are committed to own hotels which are grouped into eleven combinations and leased to separate affiliates of publicly owned hotel companies including marriott  host marriott corporation host  crestline capital corporation crestline  patriot american hospitality corp

we acquired these hotels in february data includes four hotels that were open for less than one full year as of december  and four others which opened late in december seven of the remaining eight hotels opened during as a result  a display of comparative operating results is not meaningful 
seasonality our hotels have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of the hotel industry with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is not expected to cause fluctuations in our rental income because we believe that the revenues generated by our hotels will be sufficient for the lessees to pay rents on a regular basis notwithstanding seasonal fluctuations 
year our in house computer systems environment is limited to software and hardware developed by third parties and installed  operated and monitored by our investment advisor 
all of our computer systems which are limited to financial reporting and accounting systems were installed within the last two years and we believe such systems are year compliant 
all costs associated with our computer systems are borne by our investment advisor 
our business is heavily dependent upon the efforts of our third party tenants and their affiliates which operate all of our hotels 
our leases and other contractual relationships require these operators to conduct the daily operations of our hotels and the scope of the operators responsibilities includes ensuring preparedness for the year as such  our activities related to year issues that might effect the systems used by our operators which include reservations  financial  accounting  personnel  payroll  payables and other systems have been limited to inquiry and evaluation of our operators preparedness and contingency plans 
each operator as of december  including marriott  host  patriot  candlewood and sholodge has responded to our inquiries related to the year based on operator responses to these inquiries  we believe that these operators are in the process of studying their systems and the systems of their vendors  suppliers and service providors to ensure preparedness 
current levels of preparedness are varied and include partially completed inventory and assessment of potential risks  testing  implementation of plans for remediation and reprogramming 
while we believe the efforts of our tenants and their contingency plans described in their responses will be or are adequate to address year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which we rely will be year compliant on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on us 
our costs related to the year issues are expected to be zero 
if the efforts of our vendors and tenants to prepare for the year were ineffective  our properties could be subject to significant adverse effects  including  but not limited to  loss of business and growth opportunities  reduced revenues and increased expenses which might cause operating losses by its tenants at their operating properties 
continued or severe operating losses may cause one or more of our tenants to ultimately default on their leases 
numerous lease defaults could jeopardize our ability to maintain our financial results of operations and meet our financial operating and capital obligations 
inflation we believe that inflation should not have a material adverse effect us 
although increases in the rate of inflation may tend to increase interest rates which we may be required to pay for borrowed funds  we have a policy of obtaining interest rate caps in appropriate circumstances to protect us from interest rate increases 
in addition  our leases provide for the payment of percentage rent to us based on increases in total sales  and such rent should increase with inflation 
certain considerations the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions and contains certain statements of our beliefs  intent or expectation concerning projections  plans  future events and performance 
the estimates  assumptions and statements  such as those relating to our ability to expand our portfolio  performance of our assets  the ability to make distributions  our tax status as a real estate investment trust  the ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity and to access capital markets  depend upon various factors over which we and or our lessees have or may have limited or no control 
those factors include  without limitation  the status of the economy  capital markets including prevailing interest rates  compliance with the changes to regulations within the hospitality industry  competition  changes to federal  state and local legislation and other factors 
we cannot predict the impact of these factors  if any 
however  these factors could cause our actual results for subsequent periods to be different from those stated  estimated or assumed in this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and prudent at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with interest rate changes 
we manage our exposure to this market risk through our monitoring of available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  furthermore  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage such exposure in the near future 
at december   our total outstanding debt consisted of three issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes principal balance coupon maturity interest payments due million monthly million semi annually million monthly no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
hypothetically  if at maturity these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are percentage point higher than shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately million 
based on the balances outstanding as of december  a hypothetical immediate percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations by approximately million 
at december   we had no fixed rate debt 
each of our fixed rate debt arrangements allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
in some cases  we are not allowed to make early repayment prior to a cutoff date and in other cases were are allowed to make prepayments only at a premium to face value 
in any event  these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing at lower rates prior to maturity 
our line of credit bears interest at floating rates and has a maturity in as december   there were no outstanding borrowings and million was available for drawing under our line of credit 
our line of credit is available to finance our acquisition commitments 
as of december   our acquisition commitments required approximately million excluding closing costs of cash 
assuming these commitments were funded with borrowings under our line of credit  and assuming interest rates increased percentage point  our annualized interest cost would increase by approximately  repayments under the line of credit may be made at any time without penalty
