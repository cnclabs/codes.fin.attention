also reducing agricultural sales for were lower sales from the company s rhino international operation  described more fully in the paragraph below 
domestic industrial sales for were million compared to million in the prior year  a million or increase  as a result of continued strength in customer orders 
european sales for were million  a decrease of million or compared to million for last year 
the decrease in european sales was primarily due to continued weakness in farm income in the united kingdom and the impact of currency movements  particularly the strength of the british pound against the french franc  which negatively impacted sales of the company s uk manufactured products 
european sales showed some firming in the second half of  but are still below historical levels 
in december  the operations of the company s chinese tractor import and marketing business  rhino international  were terminated 
these operations had experienced a decline in sales and profitability related to market factors 
sales in were million versus million in alamo is in the process of collection of accounts receivable of rhino international and disposal of its remaining inventory and expects to conclude this process by mid in  the effect of rhino international  including settlement of certain litigation as well as inventory and accounts receivable losses expected in final collection and disposition  was an after tax loss of million or per diluted share  compared to an after tax loss in of million or per diluted share 
approximately of the company s sales were attributable to replacement parts  the same percentage as in the replacement parts business is generally less cyclical and more profitable than the whole goods business 
cost of sales in was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in impacting costs of sales in the first quarter of were production inefficiencies  including supplier delays  caused by the need to rapidly accelerate production to meet increasing order rates  and in the last half of the year manufacturing cost variances as production levels were reduced to accommodate lower business volume 
costs of sales in also included the impacts of inventory writedowns related to disposing of the remaining inventory at rhino international 
gross margins in were also reduced by heavier discounts given in agricultural markets  obsolescence charges in inventory particularly in operations acquired in and costs of operations of regional warehouse additions 
selling  general and administrative expense in was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales for the increase in selling  general and administrative expense of million was primarily attributable to the settlement of and legal costs related to certain litigation relating to rhino international  accounts receivable writedowns of rhino international and legal and other costs related to the company s proposed merger transaction with woods equipment company  which was terminated subsequent to december  merger costs were million  after tax  or per diluted share in interest expense was million in compared to million in the company s income before income taxes from its us operations decreased approximately million from million in to million in the company s income before income taxes from its foreign operations decreased approximately million from million in to million in net income for was million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for as a result of the factors described above 
without the effect of the net losses of rhino international as described above  net income would have been million or per diluted share and net income would have been million or per diluted share 
compared to net sales for were million  an increase of million or compared to million for the prior year 
domestic agricultural sales were million compared to million for  representing a million or increase in such sales 
domestic industrial sales for were million  an increase of million or compared to million for the prior year 
a return to more normal weather patterns in american markets benefited sales along with generally favorable market conditions 
european sales for were million  a decrease of million or compared to million for the prior year 
the european sales decline of reflects early sales gains offset by late weakness caused largely by competitive impacts on uk exports arising from the strength of the uk currency versus other european currencies 
also affecting european markets were general declines in certain european economies and  in the uk  the continuing impact of bse mad cow disease on the uk agricultural market 
costs of sales in were million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in costs of sales for were increased by year end charges primarily related to acquisitions made in selling  general and administrative expense in was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales for the increase for was primarily attributable to increased staffing related to company growth and expenditures in pursuit of strategic acquisitions during interest expense was million in compared to million in net income for was million or diluted earnings per share of compared to million or diluted earnings per share of for as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for and million for the consolidated balance sheet at december  reflects net changes over december  in accounts receivable and inventories of a million increase and a million decrease  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable is largely attributable to longer terms granted in an agricultural marketing program which has subsequently been terminated  while the decrease in inventories is a result of programs targeted at reducing inventories and write downs in rhino international  offset by inventory increases from decreased sales as described above and a one time increase in stocking of replacement parts in warehouses 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  and the company expects to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow 
the company has been authorized by its board of directors to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock to be funded through working capital and credit facility borrowings 
in the company repurchased  shares 
no shares were repurchased in as of december   the company had a million contractually committed  unsecured  long term bank revolving credit facility under which the company can borrow and repay until december   with interest at various rate options based upon prime or eurodollar rates  with such rates either floating on a daily basis or fixed for periods up to days 
proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes or  subject to some limitations  acquisitions 
the loan agreement contains certain financial covenants  customary in credit facilities of this nature  including minimum financial ratio requirements and limitations on dividends  indebtedness  liens and investments 
as discussed in note of notes to financial statements  the company was initially not in compliance with certain financial covenants at december  the bank amended the covenant requirements effective for the period ended december  and for future periods 
after this amendment  the company was in compliance with all covenants as of december  at december   million was borrowed under the revolving credit facility at various interest rate options  with an average effective rate of 
at december   million of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by certain vendor contracts 
the company s borrowing levels are seasonal with the greatest utilization generally occurring in the first quarter and early spring 
management believes that the bank credit facility and the company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation the company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date 
general description of the year issue and the nature and effects of the year on information technology it and non it systems many of the world s computer systems including those in non information technology equipment and systems currently record years in a two digit format 
if not addressed  such computer systems will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could lead to business disruptions in the us and internationally the year issue 
the potential costs and uncertainties associated with the year issue will depend on a number of factors  including software  hardware and the nature of the industry in which a company operates 
additionally  companies must coordinate with other entities with which they electronically interact 
both us and international companies that do not address the year issue could experience business disruptions such as system failures or miscalculations that could cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
state of readiness to date  the company has fully completed its assessment of all its information systems that could be significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems in its domestic operations would not be affected 
this is due to the fact that the company s primary operating system does not utilize a two digit date format 
the company presently believes that required modifications will be made in the ordinary course of business and will be completed by mid the company s systems utilized in its european operations are an older version of the us operating system and are not year compliant 
the company is in the process of testing and updating those programs which are not compliant 
this process is expected to be completed in the third quarter of  and such modifications will be made in the ordinary course of business 
the company has substantially completed the assessment of its software and hardware embedded chips used in production and manufacturing systems and does not anticipate any significant required modifications 
the company s products are generally not dependent on computer chips  and accordingly  the company does not believe that the year issue presents a material exposure as it relates to its products 
in addition  the company has gathered information about the year compliance status of its significant suppliers and subcontractors external agents and continues to monitor their compliance 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
however  the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
costs the company will utilize primarily internal resources to reprogram  or replace  test and implement software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is not expected to exceed  and is being expensed as incurred 
risks and worst case scenario management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
although no assurances can be given as to the company s compliance  particularly as it relates to third parties  including governmental entities  based upon the progress to date  the company does not expect that the future costs of modifications or the consequences of any unsuccessful modifications will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
accordingly  the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unanticipated costs and or business interruptions due to year problems in its internal systems or its supply chain  or that such costs and or interruptions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
contingency plan the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of the year program 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion during the second quarter of and determine whether such a plan is necessary 
euro conversion on january   the european economic and monetary union emu entered a three year transition phase during which a new common currency  the euro  was introduced in participating countries which established fixed conversion rates through the european central bank ecb between existing local currencies and the euro 
from that date  the euro is traded on currency exchanges 
following introduction of the euro  local currencies will remain legal tender until december  during this transition period  goods and services may be paid for with the euro or the local currency under the emu s no compulsion  no prohibition principle 
based on its evaluation to date  management believes that the introduction of the euro will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro will have on the marketplace  and there is no guarantee that all issues will be foreseen and corrected or that other third parties will address the conversion successfully 
the company has reviewed its information systems software and identified modifications necessary to ensure business transactions can be conducted consistent with the requirements of the conversion to the euro 
certain of these modifications have been implemented  and others will be implemented during the course of the transition period 
the company expects that modifications not yet implemented will be made on a timely basis and expects the incremental cost of the euro conversion to be immaterial 
any costs associated with implementing changes to comply with the euro conversion are expensed as incurred 
the euro introduction is not expected to have a material impact on the company s overall currency risk 
the company anticipates the euro will simplify financial issues related to cross border trade in the emu and reduce the transaction costs and administrative time necessary to manage this trade and related risks 
however  the company believes that the associated savings will not be material to corporate results 
pending accounting standards accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company 
costs of computer software developed for or obtained for internal use 
in march  the aicpa issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed for or obtained for internal use 
the sop is effective beginning january  the sop will require the capitalization of certain costs incurred after the date of adoption in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use 
the company does not anticipate the adoption of this sop will have a material impact on the company s future earnings or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk as a result of foreign sales a portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  the united kingdom uk and france 
the company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced  but certain of the company s sales from its uk operations are denominated in other european currencies 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other european markets in which the uk subsidiary distributes its products 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the company s functional currency based sales  the company regularly hedges by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge approximately of its future net foreign currency sales transactions over a period of six months 
as of december   the company had outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million of foreign currencies including million related to a short term intercompany cash transfer 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately million 
however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
as a result of foreign translation the company s earnings and financial position are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to its significant wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france as the british pound and french franc are the functional currencies of these subsidiaries 
changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound or french franc can impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
the impact of a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound or french franc cannot be reasonably estimated 
the translation adjustment during was a gain of  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to us dollar  and the french franc closed at 
relative to british pound 
by comparison  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to us dollar  and the french franc closed at 
relative to british pound 
no assurance can be given as to future valuation of the british pound or french franc or how further movements in those currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company 
interest rate risk at december  the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  the company s interest expense would have changed by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management could take actions to mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such actions 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
