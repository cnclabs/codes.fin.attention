reference herein to any particular year or quarter generally refers to the company s fiscal year periods 
effective as of the beginning of  the company changed its organizational structure to strengthen its focus on its core businesses and thereby better meet the needs of both its customers and suppliers 
this change involved dividing the former electronic marketing group into its two major lines of business the distribution of electronic components and the distribution of computer products 
accordingly  the company currently consists of two major operating groups  electronics marketing em and the computer marketing group cmg 
through the end of  these two units comprised the former electronic marketing group 
em  which focuses on the global distribution of and value added services associated with electronic components  is comprised of three regional operations em americas  em emea europe  middle east and africa and em asia 
cmg  which focuses on middle to high end value added computer products distribution and related services  consists of avnet computer  hall mark global solutions and a number of other specialty businesses 
the business of each of these operations is described in item of this report 
references below under results of operations to em and cmg are to the new group structure 
subsequent to the end of  the company announced the creation of a third operating group avnet applied computing aac 
aac  which is being created by carving out certain business segments from em and cmg  is still in the formative stages 
accordingly  this discussion and analysis will not include any additional reference to aac 
in october  the company completed the disposition of its channel master business  the sole remaining operation in the former video communications group 
the disposition of the channel master business did not and will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition and liquidity 
results of operations consolidated sales were a record billion in  up as compared with sales of billion in em s record sales of billion in were up over as compared with billion in  and cmg s sales of billion in were up almost as compared with billion in excluding the impact of acquisitions  em s sales for were approximately higher than in and cmg s sales were up approximately during that comparative period 
em americas sales in of billion were up over as compared with the prior year  while em emea s sales were up over and em asia s sales were up due in part to sales of newly acquired businesses 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  em emea s and em asia s sales were up approximately and  respectively  as compared with the prior year 
consolidated sales also benefitted from the extra week of operations in as compared with and due to the company s week fiscal calendar 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
consolidated sales were billion in  up as compared with sales of billion in em s sales of billion in were up approximately as compared with billion in  and cmg s sales of billion in were up over as compared with billion in channel master s sales in for the portion of the year prior to its disposition were million as compared with million in em americas sales in of billion were up almost as compared with the prior year  while em emea s sales were up approximately and em asia s sales were essentially unchanged 
in connection with the change in organizational structure referred to above  the company reorganized both its em americas and em emea operations 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded million pre tax and million after tax per share on a diluted basis of incremental special charges associated primarily with the european portion of its em emea operations 
approximately million of the pre tax charge is included in operating expenses  most of which required an outflow of cash  and million is included in cost of sales  which represented a non cash write down 
these charges included severance  inventory reserves required related to supplier terminations and other items 
the first quarter charges in also included some incremental costs associated with the completion of the reorganization of em americas  most of the costs for which were recorded in the fourth quarter of as discussed below 
these costs included primarily employee relocation and special incentive payments as well as some additional severance costs 
at july   the last day of fiscal  the only cash remaining to be expended in connection with the first quarter special charges were amounts associated with long term real property lease terminations and contractual commitments  the amounts of which were not material 
the initial special charge related to the reorganization of em americas was recorded during the fourth quarter of at that time  the company recorded million pre tax and million after tax per share on a diluted basis of incremental special charges associated principally with this reorganization 
approximately million of the pre tax charge was included in operating expenses and million was included in cost of sales 
these charges included severance  real property lease termination costs  inventory reserves required related to supplier terminations  the write down of goodwill and other items 
the write down of goodwill related to a small underperforming operating unit  the ultimate disposition of which will not have a material impact on the company s future results of operations 
of the special charges of million pre tax  approximately million did not require an outflow of cash and million required the use of cash  substantially all of which had been expended at july  management expects that the company s future results of operations will benefit from the expected cost savings resulting from these reorganizations  and that the impact on liquidity and sources and uses of capital resources will not be material 
the reorganization of em s european operations will have one more phase which has not yet been finalized 
that phase relates to the consolidation of warehousing operations in europe 
construction of the central warehouse facility located in tongeren  belgium has been completed and it is currently anticipated that the warehouse will begin operations in the second quarter of fiscal year the implementation of this final phase will result in some incremental special charges related primarily to severance and various other relocation related costs 
in addition to the first quarter special charges referred to above  the results include the fourth quarter net gain associated with management s decision to exit the printed catalog business 
the net gain consisted of the million pre tax gain on the sale of the company s former allied electronics subsidiary on july   the last day of fiscal  offset somewhat by charges of million recorded in connection with the intended disposition of the avnet setron catalog operation in germany 
most of the charge related to the intended disposition of avnet setron involved the non cash write off of goodwill and a reserve for inventory on product lines not typically sold by em s core businesses 
the net positive effect on fourth quarter pre tax income  net income and diluted earnings per share was million  million and  respectively 
the unusually large impact on taxes was as a result of the elimination of goodwill attributable to the allied and setron businesses for which no tax benefit is available 
in total  the special items recorded in as discussed above positively impacted income before income taxes  net income and diluted earnings per share by million  million and  respectively 
of the million pre tax gain related to special items  charges of million are included in operating expenses and million are included in cost of sales  and the million net pre tax gain on the sale of allied electronics is shown separately in the consolidated statement of income 
the net positive impact of the special items on diluted earnings per share for was less than the sum of the applicable amounts for the fourth quarter and first quarter per share less per share due to the effect of the company s stock repurchase program on the weighted average number of shares outstanding see liquidity and capital resources below and the amount of the special items 
in addition to the fourth quarter special charges referred to above  the results included the second quarter gain on the sale of the company s former channel master business amounting to million pre tax  offset somewhat in operating expenses by million of costs relating to the divestiture of avnet industrial  the closure of the company s corporate headquarters in great neck  new york  and the anticipated loss on the sale of company owned real estate 
at the time the special charges were recorded  they represented primarily a non cash write down to reflect the expected value to be received upon the disposition of avnet industrial and the company owned real estate 
the company has subsequently disposed of avnet industrial for an amount approximating the written down value and is still in the process of disposing of the company owned real estate  the written down value of which is still believed to approximate its market value based upon real estate appraisals 
the disposition of the company owned real estate will not have a material impact on the company s future results of operations  liquidity and sources and uses of capital resources 
the net effect of these items was to increase income before income taxes by million and net income by million per share on a diluted basis for the second quarter 
in total  the special items recorded in  as discussed above  negatively impacted income before income taxes  net income and diluted earnings per share by million  million  and per share  respectively 
the effective tax rate related to the special items reflects the impact of certain amounts which are not subject to income taxes 
the net positive impact of the special items on diluted earnings per share for was less than the sum of the applicable amounts for the second quarter and fourth quarter per share less per share due to the effect of the company s stock repurchase program on the weighted average number of shares outstanding and the amount of the special items 
in  sales of semiconductors  computer products  connectors and other products principally passives and electromechanical devices represented   and  respectively  of consolidated sales  as compared with   and  respectively  in including in channel master s sales which are reflected in other products 
consolidated gross profit margins before special charges were in as compared with and in and  respectively 
this downward trend is due primarily to the competitive environment in the electronic distribution marketplace as a result of the global industry cyclical downtrend as well as the effect of increased sales of computer products including microprocessors  drams  disk drives  etc  which have lower gross profit margins than other products in the company s product lines 
em s gross profit margins were relatively stable over the four quarters in  possibly an indication that the electronics distribution industry may be beginning to rebound from the longest cyclical downtrend in its history 
although operating expenses before special charges in absolute dollars were sequentially higher during the last three years  they remained unchanged at as a percentage of sales during as compared with even during this difficult business cycle within the industry 
comparative operating expenses were negatively impacted by approximately million of incremental costs associated with the company s year remediation program see below  the extra week of expenses due to the company s week fiscal calendar and by normal operating expenses incurred by newly acquired businesses 
the company reduced operating expenses before special charges as a percentage of sales to in as compared with in as a result  operating income before special charges of million in represented of sales  as compared with million or of sales in and million or of sales in other income was million in as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
other income in included the third quarter million gain on the sale of the company s former culver city  california facility 
interest expense was million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the significant increase in interest expense during the last few years was due primarily to increased borrowings to fund the company s stock repurchase program  its acquisition program and the additional working capital requirements to support the growth in business 
as a result of the factors described above  consolidated net income including all special items in was million  or per share on a diluted basis  as compared with million  or per share on a diluted basis  in and million  or per share on a diluted basis  in excluding the special items referred to above  net income in was million  or per share on a diluted basis  as compared with net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis in net income before special items as a percentage of sales was in as compared with and in and  respectively 
as the company has increased its investment in foreign operations  the financial statement impact associated with the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates has become more apparent 
the translation into us dollars of the financial statements of the company s foreign subsidiaries resulted in a charge recorded directly to shareholders equity amounting to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of british and french currencies against the dollar 
the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of the french  canadian and far east currencies against the us dollar  and the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of the french  german  italian and swedish currencies against the us dollar 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the statement of income was not material due to the fact that avnet s international operations represent only of sales and a smaller percentage of income 
had the various average foreign currency exchange rates remained the same during as compared with  avnet s consolidated sales and net income would have been less than higher than the actual reported results for liquidity and capital resources over the last three years  cash generated from income before depreciation  amortization  the pre tax gain on the dispositions of allied electronics and channel master  and other non cash items amounted to million 
during that period  million was used for working capital needs excluding cash resulting in million of net cash flows provided from operations 
in addition  million  net  was needed for other normal business operations including purchases of property  plant and equipment million and dividends million  offset by cash generated from other immaterial items million 
this resulted in million being generated from normal business operations 
during that three year period  the company also used million  net  for the repurchase of its common stock million and the repayment of other debt million  offset somewhat by the net cash generated from dispositions of operations in excess of the cash used for acquisitions million 
this overall use of cash of million was financed by million raised from the issuance of commercial paper  the issuance of the notes due august  see below and an increase in bank debt  offset by a million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
in  the company generated million from income before depreciation  amortization  the pre tax gain on the sale of allied electronics and other non cash items  and generated million by reducing working capital  resulting in million of net cash flows provided from operations 
in addition  the company used million for other normal business operations including purchases of property  plant and equipment million and dividends million  offset by cash generated from other immaterial items million 
this resulted in million being used for normal business operations 
the company also used million to repurchase its common stock and generated million from its disposition of allied electronics  net of cash used for acquisitions  and the issuance of other debt 
of this overall generation of cash of million  million was used to reduce debt and million was added to cash and equivalents 
in  the company generated million from income before depreciation  amortization  the pre tax gain on the sale of channel master and other non cash items  and used million for working capital needs  resulting in million of net cash flows provided from operations 
in addition  the company used million for other normal business operations including purchases of property  plant and equipment million and dividends million  offset by cash generated from other immaterial items million 
this resulted in million being used for normal business operations 
the company also used million to repurchase its common stock and generated million from its disposition of channel master  net of cash used for acquisitions  and the issuance of other debt 
this overall use of cash of million was financed by a million increase in bank debt and commercial paper  offset by a million increase in cash 
the company s quick assets at july  totaled billion as compared with million at june  at july   quick assets exceeded the company s current liabilities by million as compared with million excess at the end of working capital at july  was billion as compared with billion at june  at july  to support each dollar of current liabilities  the company had of quick assets and of other current assets  for a total of as compared with at the end of the prior fiscal year 
however  the above balance sheet amounts at july  were significantly impacted by the million of cash received on that day in connection with the sale of allied electronics 
on july   cash and cash equivalents included million of before tax proceeds from the sale of allied electronics with the balance of the cash received at closing having been used to reduce commercial paper outstanding 
in addition  current liabilities at july  included approximately million of accrued income taxes payable as a result of the gain on the sale of allied electronics 
in the first quarter of  the company issued million of notes due august  the notes 
the net proceeds received by the company from the sale of the notes were approximately million after deduction of the underwriting discounts and other expenses associated with the sale of the notes 
the net proceeds from the notes have been used to repay indebtedness which the company may re borrow for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  acquisitions  repurchase of the company s common stock and working capital needs 
in june  the company entered into separate credit agreements with banca commerciale italiana and unicredito italiano 
the agreements provide eighteen month facilities with lines of credit totaling billion italian lira usd equivalent of approximately million 
the facilities are currently being used primarily as a source of working capital financing for the company s italian subsidiary 
in addition  in september  the company entered into an agreement with kbc  a belgian bank  to finance the construction of the new avnet europe  nv sa distribution center in tongeren  belgium 
the agreement provides for multiple term loans totaling million belgian francs usd equivalent of approximately million which may be converted into term loans with maturities between three and fifteen years 
the facilities are currently being used to finance real estate  computer equipment  infrastructure and project consultancy costs related to the new european distribution center 
in the first quarter of  the company renegotiated its revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by nationsbank of north carolina  na  which has now merged with bank of america 
the agreement provides a five year facility with a line of credit of up to million 
the company may select from various interest rate options and maturities under this facility 
this credit facility serves as a primary funding vehicle as well as a backup for the company s commercial paper program pursuant to which the company is authorized to issue short term notes for current operational business requirements 
the credit agreement contains various covenants  none of which management believes materially limit the company s financial flexibility to pursue its intended financial strategy 
on september   the company s board of directors authorized a new million stock repurchase program 
the stock is to be purchased in the open market from time to time or in directly negotiated purchases 
this program is in addition to the million and million programs authorized by the board of directors in august and november  respectively  and which were completed during during  the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
during and  the company used approximately million and million  respectively  to purchase a total of million shares million shares in and million shares in 
taking into account the board of directors authorizations since august  the company has purchased almost million shares using approximately million in the process 
the company suspended its stock repurchase program in january as softer operating earnings caused its interest coverage ratio to fall below the company s self imposed limit 
at july   the company had million outstanding under its commercial paper program  million outstanding under its various bank syndicated revolving credit facilities  million of the notes due august   million of the notes due march   and million of other debt 
this million of total debt outstanding at july  represents a decrease of million from the million outstanding at june  the company s debt to capital shareholders equity plus total debt ratio was approximately at july  and at june  during the last three years  the company s shareholders equity decreased by million to  million at july   while total debt increased by million to million 
the decrease in shareholders equity during that three year period was the net result of the positive impact of net income million and other items  net  principally related to stock option and incentive programs million  offset by the repurchase of common stock million  dividends million and cumulative translation adjustments million 
the company s favorable balance sheet ratios would facilitate additional financing  if  in the opinion of management  such financing would enhance the future operations of the company 
currently  the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company and the former owners of a company owned site in oxford  north carolina have entered into a consent decree and court order with the environmental protection agency epa for the environmental clean up of the site  the cost of which  according to the epa s remedial investigation and feasibility study  is estimated to be approximately million  exclusive of the million in epa past costs paid by the potentially responsible parties prp s 
pursuant to a consent decree and court order entered into between the company and the former owners of the site  the former owners have agreed to bear at least of the clean up costs of the site  and the company will be responsible for not more than of those costs 
in addition  the company has received notice from a third party of its intention to seek indemnification for costs it may incur in connection with an environmental clean up at a site in rush  pennsylvania resulting from the alleged disposal of wire insulation material at the site by a former unit of the company 
based upon the information known to date  management believes that the company has appropriately accrued in its financial statements for its share of the costs of the clean ups at all the above mentioned sites 
the company is also a prp  or has been notified of claims made against it  at an environmental clean up site in huguenot  new york 
at this time  management cannot estimate the amount of the company s potential liability  if any  for clean up costs in connection with this site  but does not anticipate that this matter or any other contingent matters will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
management is not now aware of any commitments  contingencies or events within the company s control which may significantly change its ability to generate sufficient cash from internal or external sources to meet its needs 
pending acquisitions during the last few months  the company has announced agreements to acquire three businesses which are expected to have a substantial positive impact on the company 
in june  the company entered into a merger agreement to acquire marshall industries and its wholly owned subsidiary  sterling electronics  one of the world s largest distributors of electronic components and computer products  for a combination of cash and avnet stock 
the merger is subject to the approval of both the avnet and marshall shareholders at meetings to be held on october  in the merger  holders of marshall common stock will receive  in exchange for each share they hold  either in cash or of a share of avnet common stock subject to variation between and of a share depending upon a day average of the closing prices of avnet common stock ending five trading days before the date of the special meeting of marshall shareholders being held to vote on the transaction  or a combination of cash and avnet common stock 
details of the transaction are delineated in the joint proxy statement prospectus of avnet and marshall dated september   which shareholders of avnet are encouraged to read 
the transaction has a total value of approximately million 
this includes a purchase price for the equity of marshall of approximately million  consisting of million in cash and million in avnet stock  as well as direct transaction expenses of million and the assumption of marshall debt of million  less potential stock option proceeds of million if all holders of marshall stock options exercise such options 
the above amounts assume the issuance of million shares of avnet stock at a price of  both amounts being subject to change as specified in the merger agreement 
marshall s annual sales are approximately billion 
the company has also entered into separate agreements to acquire of eurotronics  bv which does business under the name sei  a pan european electronics components distributor headquartered in the netherlands  and of the sei macro group  an electronics components distributor headquartered in the united kingdom 
the combined transaction value of these two acquisitions  including the assumption of debt  is in the range of million to be paid for with a combination of cash and avnet stock 
both transactions are subject to antitrust approvals  and the acquisition of the sei macro group is subject to the approval of the selling company s shareholders 
the company will acquire the remaining of eurotronics along with the acquisition of marshall which holds the and the remaining of the sei macro group when it completes the acquisition of eurotronics 
the combined annual sales of eurotronics and the sei macro group are approximately million 
in order to finance the cash component of these transactions and to provide additional working capital capacity  the company is in the process of entering into a million day credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
this credit facility is in addition to the currently outstanding million year bank syndicated credit facility entered into in september referred to above 
to capitalize on growing world markets for electronic components and computer products  the company has pursued and expects to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to expand its business 
management believes that the company has the ability to generate sufficient capital resources from internal or external sources in order to continue its expansion program 
in addition  as with past acquisitions  management does not expect that future acquisitions will materially impact the company s liquidity 
market risks certain of the company s operations  primarily its international subsidiaries  occasionally purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the market risk related to the foreign exchange contracts is offset by the changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the amount of risk and the use of derivative financial instruments described above is not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
including the recently issued notes  approximately of the company s outstanding debt is in fixed rate instruments and is subject to variable short term interest rates 
accordingly  the company will be impacted by any change in short term interest rates 
the company does not hedge either its investment in its foreign operations or its floating interest rate exposures 
the year issue with the calendar year only a few months away  many companies  including avnet  are having to modify their computer systems and applications which currently use two digit fields to designate a year year issue 
management has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on the company s reporting systems and operations 
the company has engaged several outside consulting firms and is using internal resources to perform a comprehensive remediation of the company s computer systems before the year the company s remediation plan with respect to its critical internal systems has consisted of four phases i high level assessment of systems  ii detailed assessment  remediation and unit testing  iii deployment and iv integration testing 
the company has already completed all four phases on most of its critical internal systems  and is in the deployment and integration testing phases for the remaining critical systems 
all phases for all critical systems are expected to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal the costs to modify the existing computer systems and applications are significant  however  they have not been and will not be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
the current estimate including potential capital expenditures is in the range of million to million  of which the company has already incurred or has committed to incur approximately million 
management believes that the company s most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would involve the failure by third parties to provide products or services to the company as a result of problems experienced by such third parties with respect to the year issue 
third party system failures could cause the company to experience disruption of receipt of products from suppliers  interruption of telecommunication and transportation services  or interruption of other critical services 
while it is unpredictable at this point in time whether such a worst case scenario is likely to occur  it is possible that any such disruptions of sufficient magnitude could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company is in contact with all its major suppliers to ascertain their progress in implementing year remediation 
although the company cannot control the efforts of the many third parties with which it interfaces  management does not currently anticipate that there will be any significant disruption of the company s ability to transact business 
if  however  the company determines that critical supplies or services from third parties are in jeopardy as a result of the year issue  the company will immediately adopt or develop contingency plans which are responsive to the circumstances 
the company has already developed and is continuing to implement systems which will identify interchangeable products for many of the products the company sells 
these systems would be an important part of the company s overall contingency plan in the event a particular supplier becomes unable to meet the company s requirements for delivering products to it 
the euro effective on january   a single european currency the euro was introduced and certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing national currencies and the euro 
the participating countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date  and during the transition period through january  either the euro or the participating country s national currency will be accepted as legal currency 
the company is addressing the issues raised by the introduction of the euro including  among other things  the potential impact on its internal systems  tax and accounting considerations  business issues and foreign exchange rate risks 
although management is still evaluating the impact of the euro  management does not anticipate  based upon information currently available  that the introduction of the euro will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations
