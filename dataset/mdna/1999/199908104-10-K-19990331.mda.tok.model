subsequent to december   and through march   the company completed acquisitions of companies for approximately million in cash   shares of common stock  approximately million in convertible subordinated notes and approximately million in subordinated notes 
these acquisitions will be accounted for as purchase transactions 
in july  the company entered into a credit agreement with bank one  texas  na the credit facility 
the credit facility was amended and restated in september primarily to provide for additional banks to lend to the company under the credit facility 
at that time  the credit facility provided the company with an unsecured revolving line of credit of million 
the credit facility was further amended in april and again in december in order to increase borrowing capacity and to provide for additional banks to lend to the company under the credit facility 
the credit facility currently provides the company with a revolving line of credit of up to million secured by accounts receivable  inventory and the shares of capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the company currently has a choice of two interest rate options when borrowing under the credit facility 
under one option  the interest rate is determined based on the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the bank s prime rate 
an additional margin of zero to is then added to the higher of these two rates 
under the other interest rate option  borrowings bear interest based on designated short term eurodollar rates which generally approximate libor plus to 
the additional margin for both options depends on the ratio of the company s debt to ebitda 
commitment fees of to per annum  also depending on the ratio of debt to ebitda  are payable on the unused portion of the facility

the company anticipates that available borrowings under its credit facility and cash flow from operations will provide cash in excess of the company s normal working capital needs  debt service requirements  planned capital expenditures for equipment and additional acquisition opportunities 
should the company accelerate or revise its acquisition program  the company may need to seek additional financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities or increase its credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will secure such financing if and when it is needed  or that such financing will be available on terms that the company deems acceptable 
year computers  software  and other equipment utilizing embedded technology that use only two digits to identify a year in a date field may be unable to process accurately certain date based information at or after the year this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the company has implemented a year program and is using both internal and external resources to assess and replace or reprogram computers  software and other equipment as needed 
key areas of the company s operations that are being addressed include external customers  external suppliers and internal computers  software and potential back up and contingency plans 
year considerations may have an effect on some of the company s customers and suppliers  and thus indirectly on the company 
if the company s vendors or suppliers of the company s necessary dispatching  power  telecommunications  transportation and financial services fail to provide the company with equipment and service  the company will be unable to provide services to its customers 
if any of these uncertainties were to occur  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company is studying the potential effect on the company with respect to customers and suppliers with year issues and does not currently expect a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations at this time 
the company has initiated communications with its significant customers and suppliers to assess the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties with which the company transacts business 
the company s initial assessment identified year issues within the company s operating systems 
the total cost of anticipated year enhancements is approximately  and is being funded from operating cash flows 
the majority of such costs is for the acquisition of hardware and software and will be capitalized 
the remaining costs will be expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
the company expects  but cannot be certain  that it will be substantially complete with year enhancements for internal operating systems by september the ability of third parties with which the company transacts business to adequately address year issues is outside of the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the failure of the company  or such third parties  to adequately address their respective year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
accordingly  as part of the year program  contingency plans are being assessed and developed to respond to any failures as they may occur 
such contingency plans are scheduled to be completed during at this time  the company does not expect that any failure of the company or third parties to achieve year compliance will adversely affect the company 
seasonality and cyclicality the hvac industry is subject to seasonal variations 
specifically  the demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months 
demand for hvac services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months 
accordingly  the company expects its revenues and operating results generally will be lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
historically  the construction industry has been highly cyclical 
as a result  the company s volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new installation projects in various geographic regions of the united states 
factors which may affect future results the company s future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors  including the lack of a combined operating history and the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses  cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in the demand for hvac systems  difficulties in implementing its acquisition strategy and the availability of acquisition financing 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to integrate the acquired companies and the future businesses that it acquires 
the businesses operated as separate  independent entities prior to their affiliation with the company  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate the operations of these businesses successfully or institute the necessary systems and procedures  including accounting and financial reporting systems  to effectively manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis 
the pro forma combined historical financial results of the acquired businesses primarily cover periods when such businesses were not under common control or management and  therefore  may not be indicative of the company s future financial or operating results 
key elements of the company s strategy are to both maintain and improve the profitability of the acquired businesses and to continue to expand the revenues of acquired businesses 
the company s level of success in this strategy  if any  will be affected by demand for new or replacement hvac systems 
in part  such demand will be contingent upon factors outside the company s control  such as the level of new construction or the potential for slower replacement based upon the overall level of activity in the economy 
the hvac industry is subject to both seasonal and cyclical variations  meaning that temperate weather and downturns in the domestic or regional economies will negatively affect overall demand for the company s services 
the company has grown significantly through the acquisition of additional hvac and complementary businesses and intends to continue such acquisition activity in the future 
however  the company could face difficulties in implementing its acquisition strategy 
the company faces continuing competition for acquisition candidates  a fact that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices 
the hvac industry is currently undergoing rapid consolidation on both a national and a regional level by the company and by other companies that have acquisition objectives that are similar to the company s objectives 
additionally  hvac equipment manufacturers and certain public utilities are beginning to provide maintenance  repair and replacement services within the hvac industry 
these companies generally are better capitalized  have greater name recognition and may be able to provide these services at a lower cost 
acquisitions also involve a number of special risks  including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results  diversion of management s attention and failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business 
there are also risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities resulting from the acquired businesses operations prior to their acquisition 
any of these risks  or a combination of them  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the timing  size and success of the company s acquisition efforts depend in large part on the availability of financing 
the company intends to continue to finance future acquisitions by using shares of its common stock for a portion of the consideration to be paid 
if the common stock does not have sufficient market value  or if potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  the company may be required to utilize more of its cash resources  if available  to maintain its acquisition program 
one factor that may affect the common stock s market price in the future  and thus its usefulness as acquisition currency  is the dilutive effect of the continued issuance of shares in connection with acquisitions 
the availability of such shares in the market when they become eligible for sale could affect the company s stock valuation ie  upon the expiration of contractual restrictions or of specified holding periods for unregistered shares 
if the company fails to maintain its stock valuation  and if the company does not have sufficient cash resources  its growth could be limited unless it is able to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financing 
the timely provision of high quality installation service and maintenance  repair and replacement of hvac systems by the company requires an adequate supply of skilled hvac technicians 
in addition  the company depends on the senior management of the businesses it acquires to remain committed to the success of the businesses after their acquisition 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain and increase its productivity and profitability are also affected by its ability to employ  train and retain the skilled technicians necessary to meet the company s service requirements  and to retain senior management in acquired businesses 
hvac systems are also subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including the clean air act and those regulating the production  servicing and disposal of certain ozone depleting refrigerants used in hvac systems 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the company operates will not change significantly in the future 
the company s failure to comply  or the costs of compliance  with such laws and regulations could adversely affect the company s future results 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not necessarily be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not rely solely on historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the hvac industry  the increasing supply of tradable stock  changes in analysts earnings estimates  recommendations by analysts  or other events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
the company is not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interst rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the company s debt with fixed interest rates consists of capital leases  convertible subordinate notes  subordinated notes and various other notes payable 
the company s debt with variable interest rates consists entirely of its revolving credit facility 
the following table presents principal amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december fair thereafter value liabilities long term debt variable rate debt   average interest rate fixed rate debt      average interest rate
