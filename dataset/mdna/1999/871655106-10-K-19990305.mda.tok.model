in  three manufacturing services customers of the electronics group altered their outsourcing strategies  which resulted in a million decrease in net revenue 
one of these customers was utilizing certain manufacturing services on a temporary basis while it increased capacity to provide its manufacturing services internally 
the other two customers altered their outsourcing strategies and moved their manufacturing solutions overseas 
changes in customer demand and the completion of certain long term contracts collectively accounted for the remaining million of the decrease in net revenue in the electronics group 
the million increase in the industrial group s net revenue was primarily due to shipments of truck axles and forged aerospace products  which increased net revenue by million and million  respectively

the company believes cash generated from operations  existing cash reserves and available borrowings under its existing credit facility will satisfy the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company s balance sheet at december  includes the effects of the reorganization and  accordingly  the comparison to the balance sheet at december  for other assets  other noncurrent liabilities  minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  redeemable common stock  common stock  and additional paid in capital reflects changes resulting from the accounting adjustments recorded pursuant to the reorganization 
impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software which recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
sypris has implemented a company wide year project the yk project to address the year issue 
the yk project encompasses both information technology it and non it systems 
the yk project is being addressed by project teams at each of the company s subsidiaries and by the company s it committee  which consists of senior members of the it departments from each subsidiary 
beginning in  the company began a program of reviewing its enterprise resource planning erp systems to reduce the number of erp systems utilized across its business units and improve overall access to information 
during  the company selected three primary erp systems and is in the process of implementing the upgrades or conversions for these new systems 
all new erp systems are year compliant  and the implementations have been completed or are scheduled for completion at various dates through the second quarter of the company has a contingency plan for the implementation of one erp system  which provides for a year compliance patch to its current system in the event an unforeseen problem is encountered during the total system conversion 
the implementation of the contingency plan would only become necessary in the event the erp system conversion would not be complete by the second quarter of a detailed assessment of all significant it systems has been completed 
the project teams are implementing plans to correct problems identified during the assessment phase of the yk project 
the implementation of the new erp systems and the related hardware modifications have addressed the majority of the company s business systems 
the company has also upgraded or replaced the majority of its personal computers and standardized its desktop software applications over the past three years 
the company expects that the testing and remediation of all it systems will be complete by the second quarter of a detailed assessment of all significant non it systems is expected to be completed by the first quarter of the company has identified the critical non it systems  which includes microcontroller based systems and other devices with embedded chips used in the engineering  manufacturing and testing processes and expects to complete the assessment  testing and remediation on the critical systems by the first quarter of completion of testing and remediation on certain of the lower priority non it systems will continue during the second and third quarters of the company is also reviewing phone  security  hvac and other facility related systems and will complete the testing and remediation of these systems by the second quarter of the company has identified and is communicating with customers  suppliers and other critical service providers to determine if entities with which the company transacts business have an effective plan in place to address the year issue  and to determine the extent of the company s vulnerability to the failure of third parties to remediate their own year issue 
the company is relying on statements from its service and goods suppliers and is not auditing suppliers preparation plans 
risks associated with this approach are being identified and contingency plans will be developed as needed 
as of december   the company has spent less than  on its yk project  primarily on the assessment phase of the yk project 
costs to be incurred in to correct year problems are estimated at approximately  such costs do not include normal system upgrades and replacements 
the costs incurred by the company for the new erp systems are considered to be normal system upgrades and replacements and  therefore  are not included in costs for the yk project 
the company does not expect the costs relating to year remediation to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the yk project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its material third party suppliers and customers 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new erp systems and completion of the yk project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all borrowings under the company s credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate  the london interbank offered rate  or certain alternative short term rates 
an increase in interest rates of basis points would not significantly affect the company s net income 
substantially all of the company s business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on the company  and they are not expected to in the foreseeable future
