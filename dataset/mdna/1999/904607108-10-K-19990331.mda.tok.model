crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus 
crusader s loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the company

year the company has initiated a review of all computer programs to ensure that all computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written utilizing two digits rather than four digits to define a year 
any computer programs which have date sensitive software utilizing a two digit year would recognize a year of as rather than this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar activities 
the company has assessed its year issues and has made and tested the necessary modifications to its computer system 
the project to review and correct all programs was completed and tested at december   prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the costs of the project has been charged to current operations as incurred and did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
crusader anticipates that any claims from its policyholders due to year events will not be material 
any business interruption losses resulting from year events which crusader policyholders may incur  would not be provided any coverage unless such events also caused physical damage to the insureds property  which the company believes is not a material exposure 
the company does business with thousands of licensed agents and brokers and does not anticipate it would be materially adversely affected if some of them are temporarily unable to function due to year problems 
the company has requested and received information from its bank and reinsurers as to their year readiness 
based on the information received to date  the company believes that it will not be materially adversely affected by its bank or its reinsurers 
due to the nature of the company s business  it is not dependent on any specific suppliers  and therefore  does not expect to be adversely materially affected by them 
due to the unusual nature of the problem and lack of historical experience with year issues  it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen after december  as stated above  the company does not anticipate it will be adversely materially affected by year events from its internal operations or from others with whom the company directly or indirectly does business 
however  other events such as general public infrastructure failures  may adversely materially affect the company s ability to operate during such failures 
the company has no formal contingency plans for year results of operations general the company had net income after taxes of  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   and  for the twelve month period ended december  total revenue for the fiscal year ended december   was  compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   and  for the twelve month period ended december  for the fiscal year ended december   income before taxes increased by  and net income increased by  compared to the fiscal year ended december  the increase in pre tax income was primarily due to an increase of  in the underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader and an increase in investment income of  excluding realized investment gains 
for the fiscal year ended december   income before taxes increased by  and net income increased by  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the increase in pre tax income was primarily due to an increase of  in the underwriting profit from crusader  an increase in investment income of  excluding realized investment gains 
the effect of inflation on the net income of the company during the fiscal year ended december   was not significant 
the company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below insurance company operation premium and loss information of crusader are as follows fiscal year ended fiscal year ended months ended december december december unaudited gross written premium    net written premium    earned premium before reinsurance    earned premium net of reinsurance    losses and loss adjustment expenses    unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses    crusader s primary line of business is commercial multiple peril business package policies 
this line of business represented approximately of crusader s total written premium for both fiscal years ended december  and crusader s written premium by state is as follows fiscal year ended fiscal year ended months ended december december december unaudited california    washington    oregon    arizona    ohio   pennsylvania   texas  montana  kentucky  nevada    total    in the fiscal year ended december   gross written premium decreased by  compared to the fiscal year ended december  in  the company changed its marketing strategy in the states of washington and oregon by discontinuing marketing through an exclusive agent in those states and commencing marketing directly to all retail agents and brokers 
this change resulted in a decrease of  or of the total decrease 
the company anticipates that the long term results of this change will be increased revenues with reduced acquisition expense and less dependence on any one large producer 
the foregoing statement is a forward looking statement and actual results may differ materially 
factors which would cause the results to differ include economic conditions in the states of washington and oregon  willingness of retail agents and brokers to deal directly with the company  and competitive conditions 
in  the company began writing business in the states of texas  montana  and kentucky and increased its writings in the states of ohio and pennsylvania  however  it was not enough to offset the decreases in the states of california  arizona  and nevada 
the decrease in gross written premium in these states was primarily due to intense price competition in the marketplace 
although the company attempts to be competitive on price  it believes that maintaining adequate rates and a favorable loss ratio is a better business strategy than increasing premiums at inadequate rates 
the validity of this strategy is reflected by the continued profitable loss ratio discussed below 
the company cannot determine how long this soft market condition will continue 
in order to grow its premium in this soft market  the company is attempting to increase its activities in its existing states by new marketing and incentive programs and by offering new and improved products to its agents and brokers 
the company s geographical expansion plan is based on cloning its california business in other states with similar demographics and legal regulatory environments 
the company s business package program has been written in california since it began writing business in  and it has proved to be successful 
when the company enters a new state  it initially does so on a limited basis in terms of agent contracts  products  and premium 
as the company develops experience in those states  it then places an emphasis on growth by expanding products and distribution activity 
the company plans to begin writing business in colorado in and illinois in currently  agents and brokers who call for quotes on policies sold by the company may also have to call competitors for quotes on products which the company does not offer 
thus  crusader competes with not only other insurance companies  but with general agents who produce business for other insurance companies 
many of these general agents offer more products than the company and thus make it easier for the agents and brokers because they can do more business with fewer telephone calls 
to provide better service to the company s agents and brokers  the company is currently working on additional non affiliated insurance company products to be offered by its general agency operations 
in addition to generating additional commission and fee income  the expansion of the general agency operation should benefit crusader because more agents and brokers may do business with the company 
in the fiscal year ended december   gross written premium increased  compared to the twelve month period ended december  this slight increase in written premium was primarily due to increased price competition in the marketplace 
in the fiscal year ended december   crusader s direct earned premium decreased  and net premium earned decreased  from the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in earned premium is directly related to the decrease in written premium in the current fiscal year 
in the fiscal year ended december   crusader s direct earned premium increased  and net premium earned increased  over the twelve month period ended december  the percentage of earned ceded premium to gross premium earned was for the fiscal year ended december   for the fiscal year ended december   and for the twelve month period ended december  the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses to net premiums earned the loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition and general operating costs to net premiums earned the expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as shown on the table  the loss ratio continued to improve primarily due to favorable development of prior year losses 
generally  if the combined ratio is below  an insurance company has an underwriting profit  if it is above  a company has an underwriting loss 
fiscal year ended fiscal year ended months ended december december december unaudited loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio the company s future writings and growth are dependent on market conditions  competition  the company s ability to introduce new profitable products  and its ability to expand geographically 
as of december   crusader was licensed as an admitted insurance company in the states of california  arizona  montana  nevada  oregon  and washington and is approved as a non admitted surplus lines writer in several other states

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of invested assets whose fair values are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company s invested assets at december   consisted of the following fixed maturity bonds at amortized value  short term cash investments at cost  equity securities at cost  certificates of deposit over year at cost  total invested assets  the company s interest rate risk is primarily in its fixed maturity bond portfolio 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  the longer the maturity  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than eight years 
in addition  although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity 
since inception of the company  only nine bonds issues have been sold prior to their maturity or call date 
because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity  the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements are unrealized  and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
as of december   the company s unrealized gains net of unrealized losses before income taxes on its fixed maturity bond portfolio was  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the fixed maturity bond portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
this decrease would not be reflected in the statement of operations except to the extent that the securities are sold 
the company s short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk 
due to the company s small investment in equity securities of approximately one half of one percent of total invested assets the company has only minimal exposure to equity price risk
