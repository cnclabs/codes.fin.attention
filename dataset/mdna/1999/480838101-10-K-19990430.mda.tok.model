the company expects to devote significant efforts in to ensure that its business critical systems are year compliant 
the year yk issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
such computer systems will be unable to accurately interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
the company has performed an assessment of its systems in order to identify yk issues and has identified its business critical area of exposure to be a merchandising and financial  b point of sale pos  c cash management  d catalog  e warehouse management  and f third party relationships 
most of the company s applications operate on two ibm as hardware configurations and are off the shelf packages with modifications and interfaces made by the company 
the company also relies on personal computers to prepare detailed analysis 
the company believes that by installing the vendor developed upgrades to the latest versions of its existing systems and re working its modifications and interfaces  most of the yk issues should be corrected

although there is a high level of confidence that these efforts will be successful  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the company has not developed a formal contingency plan should any of its critical systems not operate in the year and expects to focus on this aspect of the yk project in the second half of the company s plans and beliefs concerning future operations contained herein are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those forecast due to a variety of factors that can adversely affect the company s operating results  liquidity and financial condition such as risks associated with economic  weather and other factors affecting consumer spending  the mix of goods sold  pricing  availability of lease sites for new stores and other competitive factors
