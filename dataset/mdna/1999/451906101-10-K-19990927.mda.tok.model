impact of year identix has instituted a program to determine whether identix has exposure to year problems 
year problems are caused by computer systems that only use a two digit year value and  accordingly  will be subject to error or failure when the year arrives 
identix s year program consists of the following phases evaluation of identix products  development of solutions to year issues for identix products  customer notification and support regarding identix products  evaluation and remediation of identix s information technology infrastructure  assessment of year compliance of third party providers of critical components and services  and development of contingency plans to address year issues 
identix s year program is overseen by its year committee 
identix has completed phases  and of the year program 
in these phases  identix performed an evaluation of its products to determine their year readiness 
to the extent that a year issue was identified  identix has developed solutions to remediate the year issues 
identix is not taking remedial action for those products that will reach the end of their support life before the end of phase consists of notifying customers of year issues with identix products and providing support to the customer s remediation efforts 
the notification process has been substantially completed by june  identix s remediation support activities have commenced and will continue at least through december  identix s products are included in complex systems and the process undertaken by its customers to assess and remediate year issues may be lengthy 
for example  identix has sold touchprint products that  at the request of the customers  use a two digit value for the year 
in this case  customer remediation is likely to require a change in the customer s workflow 
phase was completed by march  identix has identified certain internal software that required updating in order to be year complaint 
as part of identix s maintenance contract for that software  the vendor of that software has provided identix with an upgrade that addresses the year problem 
further  certain hardware has been identified as non compliant and been replaced 
identix is at risk of disruption to its business if year problems are experienced by its key suppliers 
the purpose of phase is to determine the year readiness of suppliers of critical components and services 
identix has sent inquiries to its suppliers to determine their readiness with respect to year problems 
identix is still in the process of collecting and evaluating responses 
as of june  the vast majority of critical suppliers have made written claims assuring they would be able to continue to supply identix into the year a failure of a key supplier to provide identix with necessary components or services could result in a delay by identix in providing products or services to its customers and have a severe negative impact on identix s stock price or financial performance 
identix has not yet undertaken phase  the development of contingency plans to address year concerns 
identix plans to complete this in the second half of calendar to the extent that it identifies areas where there is a significant possibility that year compliance will not be achieved 
identix believes that its costs  not borne by customers  for its year program will be less than  excluding costs associated with existing internal personnel 
the costs of the program to date have been less than  identix has used existing personnel for the year program and has no current plans to add staff specifically for this purpose 
identix has not separately tracked the internal costs associated with the year program 
the year problem is pervasive and complex and there is a risk that identix has not identified all of the year issues that may affect it and that any remedial efforts it takes will not adequately address any potential year problems 
identix s products are used in systems that perform a number of critical functions 
for example  the biometric security products are used to verify individual identity in a number of high risk situations such as prisons and airports 
the biometric security products are also used to protect computer data and to verify commercial transactions  such as the authorization of money transfers by bank personnel 
although identix believes that it should not have liability for a system failure relating to the year  such a failure in these or other critical applications could potentially require identix to expend substantial resources to assist in remedying the failure or result in litigation to ascertain liability or recover costs 
identix believes that this represents the most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to the year identix has made forward looking statements regarding its year program 
these statements include the expected completion schedule for various phases of the year program  the costs to and liabilities of identix associated with the year and identix s year readiness 
there are many factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those stated in the forward looking statements 
these factors include the complexity associated with identifying year problems  the inability to ascertain year readiness and compliance of component and service suppliers  and the reaction of customers to year issues 
all of these factors make it impossible for identix to ensure that it has identified all year issues that may affect it or all costs or liabilities that it may be exposed to as a result of year issues 
the information contained in this form k related to the year constitutes year readiness disclosure for purposes of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
that act does not limit liability under the securities laws 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio is generally comprised of money market securities that mature within one year 
the company places investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain of the company s revenues  cost of revenues and marketing expenses are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international results of operations are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company does not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations
