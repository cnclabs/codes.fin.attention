item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers and suppliers throughout the contiguous united states  alaska and western and central canada 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth and constant emphasis on the development of its consolidated buying programs 
the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its marketing associates and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities 
these objectives require continuing investment 
sysco s resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
sysco s operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs  cash dividends  and acquisitions fitting within the company s overall growth strategy 
any remaining cash generated from operations also is applied toward a portion of the cost of shares repurchased in the buyback program  while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt 
sysco s initial share repurchase program was used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans 
the company significantly accelerated the repurchase program beginning in february the share repurchase program reduced outstanding shares and increased earnings per share 
the long term debt to total capitalization target ratio was increased from a range of to to a range of to due to prior and anticipated accelerated share repurchases and additional debt associated with those repurchases 
this range was exceeded as of july  due to shares repurchased for acquisitions that closed in early fiscal in november  the board authorized an additional  share buyback to be completed in calendar  in july the board authorized an additional  share buyback to be completed in fiscal  and in september the board authorized a new  share buyback to be completed in calendar the number of shares acquired and their cost for the past three years was  shares for  in fiscal   shares for  in fiscal and  shares for  in fiscal on july   the board authorized a new  share buyback 
net cash generated from operating activities was  in   in and  in expenditures for facilities  fleet and other equipment were  in   in and  in expenditures in fiscal should be in the range of  to  in april   in two separate offerings  sysco drew down the remaining  of the  shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission in june sysco issued debentures totaling  due april  these debentures were priced at par  are unsecured  are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and are redeemable at the option of the holder on april   but otherwise are not redeemable prior to maturity 
also issued were senior notes totaling  due april  these notes were priced at of par and are unsecured  not redeemable prior to maturity and not subject to any sinking fund requirement 
in may  sysco issued senior notes totaling  due may  these notes  which were priced at par  are unsecured  not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirement 
on june  sysco filed with the securities and exchange commission a  shelf registration of debt securities 
on july  sysco issued debentures totaling  under the shelf registration  due august  these debentures were priced at of par  are unsecured  are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco the right to retire the debentures at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the debenture holders are not penalized by the early redemption 
proceeds from the debentures were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper 
the net cash provided by operations less cash utilized for capital expenditures  the stock repurchase program  cash dividends and other uses resulted in net long term debt of  at july  about of the long term debt is at fixed rates averaging and the remainder is at floating rates averaging 
long term debt to capitalization was at july   up from the at june  and up from the at june  sysco continues to have borrowing capacity available and alternative financing arrangements are evaluated as appropriate 
sysco has a commercial paper program that is currently supported by a  bank credit facility 
during fiscal  and  commercial paper and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately  to  from approximately  to  and from approximately  to  respectively 
in summary  sysco believes that through continued monitoring and management of assets together with the availability of additional capital in the financial markets  it will meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 
market risk sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and holds no derivative financial instruments that could expose the company to significant market risk 
sysco s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations discussed above 
at july  the company had outstanding commercial paper of  with maturities through october  the company s remaining long term debt obligations of  were primarily at fixed rates of interest 
sysco has no significant cash flow exposure due to interest rate changes for long term debt obligations 
sales the annual increases in sales of in weeks and in resulted from several factors 
sales in fiscal and were affected by the strong growth in the us economy  as well as in the foodservice industry 
after adjusting for food price increases and acquisitions  real sales growth including the effect of the rd week was about in and in the cost of sysco s foodservice products during the first six months of fiscal were inflated about  while inflation for those costs during the latter half of the year decreased to about zero  resulting in about inflation for the entire year 
this compares to zero inflation in fiscal industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real growth of approximately in calendar and in calendar sales for fiscal through were as follows year sales increase weeks  a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below medical supplies dairy products fresh and frozen meats seafoods poultry frozen fruits  vegetables  bakery and other canned and dry products paper and disposables janitorial products equipment and smallwares fresh produce beverage products a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels all other cost of sales cost of sales increased about in and in these increases were generally in line with the increases in sales 
the rate of increase is influenced by sysco s overall customer and product mix as well as economies realized in product acquisition 
operating expenses operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling and administrative expenses 
these expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal and  and for changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several economic influences  including customer mix 
inflationary increases in operating costs generally have been offset through improved productivity 
interest expense interest expense increased  or approximately in fiscal as compared to an increase of  or approximately in fiscal the increases in fiscal and were due primarily to increased borrowings  principally to fund the share repurchase program  and the replacement of floating rate debt at higher fixed rates in fiscal interest capitalized during the past three years was  in fiscal   in  and  in other  net other decreased  or about  in fiscal and decreased  or about in fiscal changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities  primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 
earnings before income taxes earnings before income taxes rose  or approximately above fiscal  which had increased  or approximately  above the prior year 
additional sales and realization of operating efficiencies contributed to the increases  as well as the effect of the rd week 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for and was approximately 
earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change fiscal represents the twenty third consecutive year of increased earnings 
including the effect of the rd week and before the cumulative effect of an accounting change in fiscal  fiscal earnings rose  or approximately above fiscal which had increased  or approximately  over the prior year 
cumulative effect of accounting change in the second quarter of fiscal  sysco recorded a one time  after tax  non cash charge of  to comply with a new consensus ruling by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board  eitf issue no 
 requiring reengineering costs associated with computer systems development to be expensed as they are incurred 
prior to this change  sysco had capitalized business process reengineering costs incurred in connection with its sysco uniform systems information systems redevelopment project in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
net earnings net earnings for the year increased  or approximately above fiscal  which had decreased  or approximately below the prior year 
the increase was caused by the accounting change discussed above in fiscal  as well as additional sales and operating efficiencies and the effect of the rd week 
dividends the quarterly dividend rate of ten cents per share was established in february when it was increased from the nine cents per share set in february return on shareholders equity the return on average shareholders equity for fiscal was approximately compared to in fiscal before the cumulative effect of the accounting change and in since inception sysco has averaged in excess of a return on shareholders equity before the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
year sysco has been replacing and enhancing its information systems to gain operational efficiencies with the implementation of the sysco uniform system sus 
sus is year compliant and implementation will be substantially complete by december to address the year issue  sysco instituted an enterprise wide year compliance project in january sysco s year project used two outside technology consulting firms one with expertise in information technology it and project management and the other with expertise in engineering to identify year issues in non it systems and equipment that have embedded microchips 
sysco established a formal project management methodology to address the year issue 
sysco s year project consists of four phases i information gathering and planning this phase consisted of gathering information about sysco s it and non it systems  as well as identifying significant suppliers  customers and other third parties 
the primary objective was to build a detailed inventory of information  ii assessment this phase consisted of analyzing the information gathered during the first phase 
the process included examining and evaluating sysco s it systems and non it systems with embedded microchips for exposure to date sensitivity 
the primary objective of the assessment phase was to identify components that are not year compliant so that they could be corrected  replaced or eliminated  iii remediation this phase consisted of correcting  replacing or eliminating any components found during the assessment phase that were not year compliant 
this included addressing sysco s internally developed mission critical it systems  purchased hardware and software  and non it systems and equipment with embedded microchips  and iv testing this phase consisted of systems integration testing of sysco s mission critical it systems used throughout the company  as well as specific systems interface testing with certain customers and certain suppliers to ensure their year readiness 
in march  sysco completed extensive testing of its mission critical it systems using multiple year date scenarios to simulate fiscal and calendar crossovers 
these systems were found to be year compliant 
sysco has also completed a comprehensive assessment of its it systems and non it systems with embedded microchips and is completing upgrades and replacements of non compliant systems and equipment 
although the percentages of work completed vary across sysco s operations  sysco plans to complete the remaining upgrades and replacements by december an important component of sysco s year readiness efforts has focused on verifying to the extent possible that its significant suppliers are currently year compliant or have adequate remediation plans in place to ensure year compliance 
sysco analyzed and categorized its suppliers and then contacted in writing the significant suppliers to solicit information on their year preparedness efforts 
sysco has obtained year information from the majority of the identified suppliers and is in the process of contacting those few suppliers who have not yet responded 
sysco does not believe that the total costs which will be incurred to provide year compliance will have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
the company has identified three most reasonably likely worst case scenarios loss of public power supplies  loss of communication infrastructure  and failure of the company s mission critical it systems and infrastructure 
within the three most reasonably likely worst case scenarios  sysco s goal is to identify actions that can be taken prior to january that would minimize or mitigate the failures should they occur 
contingency plans have been developed for the core business functions and are being deployed to sysco s distribution centers for review and implementation 
although sysco s year efforts are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the year issue on its business and operations  the actual effects of the issue and the success or failure of the company s efforts described above cannot be known until the year failure by sysco  its suppliers  customers and other third parties to address adequately their respective year issues in a timely manner  insofar as such issues relate to the company s business and operations  could have a material adverse effect on sysco 
risk factors low margin business  economic sensitivity the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins 
sysco makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup 
as a result  sysco s profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of food price deflation  even though sysco s gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 
the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and economic conditions 
sysco s operating results also are sensitive to  and may be adversely affected by other factors  including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivables  inventory control  competitive price pressures  severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
although such factors have not had a material adverse impact on sysco s past operations  there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results 
leverage and debt service because historically a substantial part of sysco s growth has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion  sysco s continued growth depends  in large part  on its ability to continue this expansion 
as a result  its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand 
moreover  any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of sysco s common stock 
further  sysco s leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures 
product liability claims sysco  like any other seller of food  faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness 
with respect to product liability claims  sysco believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance 
however  this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost  or  if available  may not be adequate to cover liabilities 
sysco generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products  but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers 
if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available  product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce sysco s net income and earnings per share 
interruption of supplies sysco obtains all of its foodservice products from other suppliers 
for the most part  sysco does not have long term contracts with any supplier committing it to provide products to sysco 
although sysco s purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers  suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the quantities requested 
because sysco does not control the actual production of its products  it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside its control 
these conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers  weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
sysco s inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise  could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers  and customers may turn to other suppliers 
labor relations as of july    employees are members of different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations  at operating companies 
in fiscal  agreements covering  employees will expire 
failure to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages 
although sysco has not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date  and believes it has satisfactory relationships with its unions  a work stoppage due to failure to renegotiate a union contract  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on sysco 
integration of acquired companies if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner  its profitability may decrease 
integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise  or with a corporate culture different from sysco s 
if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully  it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base 
in addition  the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert management s attention from sysco s existing business and may damage sysco s relationships with its key customers and suppliers 
charter and stockholder rights plan under its restated certificate of incorporation  sysco s board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
issuance of these shares would make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors because more shares would have to be acquired to gain control 
if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco  the stockholders of sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco  which also means more shares would have to be acquired to gain control 
both of these devices may deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that would have been financially beneficial to sysco s stockholders 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include projected sales increases  anticipated capital expenditures  customer mix  product cost inflation deflation  implementation and anticipated results of fold outs  potential acquisitions and any potential benefits resulting therefrom  payment of dividends  consistency and predictability of earnings and cash flow growth  continuation of the share repurchase program  projected sales to particular customers  including but not limited to wendy s international  inc  and year readiness efforts and time tables and the anticipated costs of these efforts 
these statements are based on current expectations and management s estimates and actual results may differ materially 
decisions to pursue fold outs and acquisitions and expenditures for such could vary depending upon construction schedules and the timing of other purchases  such as fleet and equipment  while results from fold outs and acquisitions could be impacted by competitive conditions  labor issues and other matters 
acquisitions also depend upon the availability and suitability of potential candidates and management s allocation of capital 
industry growth  sales increases  customer mix  product cost inflation deflation  payment of dividends  the consistency and predictability of earnings and cash flow growth and year costs and compliance efforts could be affected by conditions in the economy  the industry and internal factors that may alter planned results 
furthermore  potential year costs and compliance efforts could be affected by the ability of sysco s suppliers and customers to effectively address year issues 
sales to particular customers could be affected by conditions in the economy and the customer s ability to make planned levels of sales available to sysco 
the share repurchase program could be affected by market prices of the company s stock as well as management s decision to utilize its capital for other purposes
