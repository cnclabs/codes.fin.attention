item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning its assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this report  including without limitation  the factors disclosed under risk factors 
introduction the company was formed to create one of the largest providers of urgent  on demand  point to point point to point delivery services in the world 
the company focuses on point to point delivery by foot  bicycle  motorcycle  car and truck and operates in of the largest metropolitan markets in the united states as well as in the united kingdom  australia  and new zealand 
the company believes that it has the largest market share of point to point delivery service companies operating in each of london  new york  san francisco  atlanta  washington  dc and seattle 
although several large  national  publicly traded companies are consolidating other segments of the delivery industry  the company believes that it is the only courier firm focused exclusively on the highly fragmented point to point delivery industry 
the company s consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  was million 
basis for presentation management does not believe that a period to period comparison of the results of operations of the company whose consolidated financial statements are included elsewhere in this annual report would be meaningful 
prior to the initial public offering on february   the company conducted no operations other than in connection with the offering and the combinations  and generated no revenues other than the receipt of licensing fees 
simultaneous with the offering  the company acquired  in separate combination transactions  urgent  on demand  point to point courier firms and one software company 
net revenues 
the company primarily earns revenues from fees charged for point to point delivery services with the remainder of revenues being derived from facilities management and other same day delivery services 
revenues consist primarily of charges to customers for individual delivery services and weekly or monthly charges for other ongoing services 
revenues are recognized when packages are delivered 
the revenue per transaction for a particular delivery service is dependent upon a number of factors  including the time sensitivity of a particular delivery  special handling requirements and local market conditions 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of costs relating directly to performance of services  including earned courier compensation and employee benefits  if any  vehicle lease expenses  radio and paging costs  and the cost of administering and managing the company s courier fleet 
a significant majority of the company s drivers own their own vehicles 
the company believes that the point to point delivery business generally offers higher gross margins than scheduled or routed deliveries  which results from the premium pricing associated with time sensitive deliveries 
the company s couriers have historically been compensated based on a fixed percentage of the revenue for a delivery 
however  the company is in the process of realigning courier compensation to an effort based standard 
management believes that this structure maximizes courier fleet productivity and allows it to better manage its pricing policies and gross margin 
in either case  the company s courier costs are essentially variable in nature 
to the extent that the couriers are employees of the company  associated employee benefit costs such as payroll taxes and insurance are also included in cost of sales 
sales  general and administrative expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses consists of three major components  i sales and marketing  includes expenses related to new business development  account management and local brand marketing initiatives  including brand and center manager compensation  sales commissions and advertising and other promotional expenses 
the company anticipates the need for additional investment in sales and marketing initiatives and the implementation and execution of national brand strategies  ii general and administrative expenses  includes salaries and benefits of management and administrative staff  professional fees  expenditures for research and development  training costs and expenses related to comprehensive insurance programs  iii other operating expenses  primarily related to the cost of operating the dms centers which includes costs associated with call capture  dispatch management  customer service  billing  collections and local supervisory personnel 
depreciation and amortization 
the company has no significant investment in warehousing facilities or transportation equipment and  as such  depreciation expense primarily relates to the depreciation of office  communication and computer equipment 
amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of acquisition goodwill 
in july  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to business combinations immediately prior to an initial public offering 
sab required that the combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid in the combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired totaled approximately million at december  this excess purchase price is recorded as goodwill on the company s balance sheet 
goodwill is amortized as a non cash charge to the income statement over a period ranging from to years 
the financial statement impact of this amortization expense for the year ended december  was approximately million  million was deductible for income tax purposes due to shorter tax lives being used 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are generated outside of the united states 
for the year ended december   approximately of total revenues were generated in the united kingdom  australia and new zealand 
the percentage of international revenues should increase slightly in with the full year impact of the acquisition of delta air road transport plc  and courier australia  pty 
these businesses were acquired in april and august  respectively 
consolidated results of operations historical results of operations reflect the activities of dispatch management services corp 
and the founding companies since february  and the subsequent acquisitions since the effective dates of acquisition 
the company did not commence operations until its acquisition of companies at the time of the offering in february therefore  comparisons to actual results are not considered meaningful and no discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december  has been included 
the following table sets forth certain items from the company s consolidated statement of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net revenue  cost of revenue  gross profit  operating expenses sales  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  liquidation of brookside systems limited 
 severance and other charges  operating loss  interest and other expenses  net  loss before income taxes  provision for income taxes  net loss before extraordinary item  overview the company s operating results for were negatively impacted by several individually significant items that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter 
the company believes that these charges are non recurring or related to costs associated with the first year of operation 
the individually significant charges included the liquidation of a software development company for million see note  severance and other charges including  costs of acquisitions not completed and employee termination costs aggregating million see note  the recording of allowances for the uncollectability of accounts and notes receivable of million see note  costs related to the early extinguishment of debt of million  as well as additional first year organizational costs 
gross margins deteriorated during the year as courier fleets were combined and additional couriers were maintained to protect service levels during the conversion to the company s road management practices and free call allocation methodology 
the company also experienced difficulties converting the front end technology of the acquired companies to the proprietary kiwi software operating system  including delays in billing and other issues associated with the scale of conversion activity 
in addition  the performance of the company in was negatively impacted by  i a significant level of integration activity following the acquisition of companies throughout the united states  the united kingdom  australia and new zealand  ii significant first year organization and infrastructure development costs  primarily professional and consulting fees  associated with the strategy of integrating the metropolitan operating centers into a national and international network  iii an aggressive technology investment program that was abandoned in the th quarter in order to focus on more fundamental technology needs  and iv the termination of certain contracts assumed or entered into at the time of the offering 
the company also experienced significant changes in its senior management team  with the termination of the chief operating officer  director of business development  and the director of road management in september  and the resignation of the chairman and chief executive officer in november  and january  respectively 
subsequent to december   the company notified its senior lenders of an event of default in relation to certain financial covenants described in the syndicated senior credit facility led by nationsbank na following this notification of default  the company operated under a forebearance agreement that deferred certain lender remedies pending a restructuring of the senior credit facility 
as described in note  the company entered into a definitive amended and restated credit agreement with nationsbank na and a syndicate of senior lenders 
the amended facility has a maturity date of may   and provides for revised financial covenants and other provisions 
the new senior management team has established a number of strategic priorities designed to stabilize operations for  including i an aggressive cost reduction program  ii a focus on receivables management and collection procedures  and iii implementation of a technology investment program designed to deliver integrated front end and back end systems  as well as enhanced cost control and reporting mechanisms 
the company has also recently executed a number of structural changes  including the appointment of four new independent directors to the company s board and the creation of a united states regional management team designed to oversee and support the metropolitan operating centers 
the company believes that the cumulative impact of such initiatives and actions will provide the company with sufficient cash flow to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months 
however  the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon  i achieving and maintaining cash flow from operations sufficient to satisfy its current obligations  ii complying with the financial covenants described in the senior credit facility and iii renegotiating its senior credit facility beyond its maturity date of may  net revenue net revenue for the year ended december  were million 
these revenues were predominantly earned from point to point delivery services throughout the united states  the united kingdom  australia and new zealand 
for the year ended december   net revenues generated in the united states  the united kingdom  australia  and new zealand were million  million  million  and million  respectively 
following certain acquisitions  the company re priced or abandoned certain revenues which failed to meet certain margin criteria  or were not pure point to point delivery businesses 
cost of revenue cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million  or of the company s revenues 
cost of revenue percentages in the united states  the united kingdom  australia and new zealand vary considerably as a result of different compensation structures  the proportion of owner operated vehicles  benefit plans  and the mix of business 
for the year ended december   cost of revenue percentages for the united states  united kingdom  australia and new zealand were    and  respectively 
cost of revenue percentages were negatively impacted during by significant additional costs introduced during conversions to the company s operating model  and the difficulty associated with the physical integration of a number of previously independent courier fleets 
as at december   the company still had a significant road integration program remaining to execute 
this program is expected to be completed during as at december   the majority of the company s us and international operating centers had not implemented the creation of time sensitive  guaranteed delivery products 
as such  the implementation of these pricing and marketing initiatives under the dms model did not have a significant impact on gross margins for selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were million  or of the company s net revenues 
selling  general and administrative percentages in the united states  the united kingdom  australia and new zealand vary considerably as a result of the degree of physical integration  different compensation structures and the mix of business 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative percentages for the united states  united kingdom  australia and new zealand were    and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative percentages were negatively impacted during by higher local operating costs introduced during conversions to the company s operating model 
the company converted over of north american revenues to the proprietary operating model during the united states selling  general and administrative percentage also includes certain non recurring corporate charges  including establishment of increased valuation reserves against receivables 
during the fourth quarter  the company determined that an increased allowance against trade and notes receivable of million was necessary 
the assessment of the realizable value of trade and notes receivable was based on  among other things  actual receipts since december   the value of collateral held  and an assessment of the underlying business prospects of the debtor and guarantor parties 
selling  general and administrative costs also reflect the cost of an aggressive technology investment program that was abandoned in the fourth quarter in order to focus on more fundamental technology needs  and expenditures associated with the organization and formation of a public company 
liquidation of brookside systems limited fleetway the company recorded a charge of million related to the liquidation of fleetway 
fleetway was a software development company that generated net operating losses since its acquisition in february this charge includes the write off of million of goodwill and capitalized software and development costs associated with the acquisition of fleetway

interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  or of the company s net revenues 
interest expense included interest on senior debt  acquired debt  acquisition related debt  and capital lease obligations  as well as bank charges and the amortization of deferred finance charges relating to the company s senior credit facility 
substantially all of the company s debt at december  was consolidated in the syndicated senior bank facility 
interest rates on the senior credit facility ranged from to during the year 
combined liquidity and capital resources the company is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries 
accordingly  the company s principal sources of liquidity are the cash flow of its subsidiaries  and cash available  if any  from its credit facility 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  million of senior bank debt  and million of short and long term acquisition related debt 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million

net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and included million from the company s offering  net of offering costs  and borrowings of million  net of repayments and direct costs incurred in obtaining financing 
on february   the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock and or net assets of the founding companies simultaneously with the closing of the offering 
the aggregate consideration for these acquisitions included approximately million in cash  the issuance of  shares of common stock  and million of notes payable 
the cash portion of these acquisitions was funded through the proceeds of the offering 
during the period following the offering to december   the company acquired an additional messenger or same day courier companies in the united states  the united kingdom  australia and new zealand 
the aggregate consideration for these acquisitions included approximately million in cash  the issuance of  shares of common stock  million in value of stock to be issued  and approximately million of notes payable 
the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisitions consummated after the offering was provided by borrowings under the company s senior credit facility 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions  the company agreed to pay the sellers additional consideration if the acquired operations meet certain performance goals related to their earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted for certain other financial related matters 
the estimated maximum amount of additional consideration payable  if all performance goals are met  is approximately million  of which million is payable in cash and million is payable in shares of the company s common stock 
these payments of additional consideration are to be made on specified dates through december  management intends to fund the cash portion of this additional consideration with internally generated cash flow 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million in the year ended december   primarily for office equipment and computer and facility upgrades 
the company expects to make capital expenditures of approximately million to upgrade certain components of its management and financial reporting systems and to install an internal computer intranet network and communications system integrating the metropolitan operating centers 
in addition  application of the dms model requires investment in local operating centers 
management presently anticipates that such additional capital expenditures will total approximately million over the next two years  including approximately million of computer equipment  million of communications equipment  and million of leasehold improvements 
however  no assurance can be made with respect to the actual timing and amount of such expenditures 
senior credit facility in june   the company entered into a credit agreement with nationsbank na as underwriter of a new million senior credit facility 
in august   nations bank led a syndication for a million committed line of credit with a group of senior lenders  including first union national bank  bankboston na  cibc  inc  and fleet bank na subsequent to december   the company notified the senior lenders of an event of default in relation to certain financial covenants described in the senior credit agreement 
following this notification of default  the company operated under a forebearance agreement that deferred certain lender remedies pending a restructuring of the senior credit facility 
as described in note  the company entered into a definitive amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with nationsbank na and the syndicate of senior lenders 
the credit agreement provides a revolving credit facility equal to the current outstanding indebtedness  or million  which includes a sub limit of million for existing standby letters of credit 
all amounts drawn down under the line of credit must be repaid on may   although minimum principal payments of are required in outstanding principal balances under the line of credit bear interest  payable monthly  at increments between and over the libor rate  depending on the company s ratio of funded debt to trailing quarter annualized ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
the initial pricing level between april  and june  will be at libor day libor at march  was 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by a first lien on all of the business assets of the company  including the stock of certain of the company s subsidiaries 
the company is required to maintain minimum absolute quarterly ebitda targets through the maturity of the facility  provided that for the last fiscal quarter of  and the first fiscal quarter of  the absolute ebitda targets are modified such that the company can still meet the financial covenant criteria by maintaining a funded debt to ebitda ratio at no more than x as defined in the credit agreement 
other financial covenants include i maintenance of monthly pre tax income on a consolidated basis after june  adjusted for certain non cash gains and losses  ii maintenance of a collateral coverage ratio whereby accounts receivable less than days as a proportion of the total outstanding under the revolving line of credit cannot fall below levels ranging from  and iii minimum quarterly interest coverage ratios  defined as ebitda as a ratio to cash interest expense  of x  x  and x for march   june   and september  and thereafter  respectively 
the credit agreement also limits or prohibits i the amount of indebtedness the company can incur  ii the amount of equipment the company can lease  iii the liens  pledges and guarantees that can be granted by the company  iv the amount of cash dividends that can be declared by the company  v certain capital expenditures  and vi the sale of stock of the company s subsidiaries 
acquisitions and disposals of certain operations require approval by the lender 
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  covenants  defaults and conditions 
the line of credit is intended to be used for short term working capital  and for the issuance of letters of credit 
the facility specifically allows for the payment of various acquisition related notes payable disclosed in the consolidated financial statements related to acquisitions 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the company expects to write off approximately  of deferred financing fees related to the previous credit facility dated june   in the second quarter of the company believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and revised acquisition related notes payable repayment schedule for the next twelve months 
given the current senior credit facility restrictions  the company is unlikely to pursue further acquisition opportunities in the next to months 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company may experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its results of operations 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of the integration of the founding companies and other acquired companies and their conversion to the dms model  the demand for the company s services  the timing and introduction of new services or service enhancements by the company or its competitors  the market acceptance of new services  competitive conditions in the industry and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of the results that the company may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year 
accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and defines a derivative and establishes common accounting principles for all types of instruments 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no  if any 
year the year issue refers to the impact on information technology and non information technology systems  including codes embedded in chips and other hardware devices  of date related issues including the identification of a year by two digits and not four so that a date using would be recognized as the year rather than 
this date related problem could result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruptions of operations or other business problems  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
the company has identified operating and software issues to address year readiness in its internal systems and with its customers and suppliers 
the company expects to address its most critical internal systems first  including the company s proprietary capture and dispatch system kiwi  and targets to have them year compliant by september  the company intends to address all major categories of information technology and non information technology systems in use by the company  including customer service  dispatch and finance 
the company plans to use both internal and external resources to reprogram and test the software for year modifications 
cost of this and all other efforts to achieve year compliance is estimated to be less than  to date  the company s expenses have been mostly limited to internal costs 
external expenditure for year compliance was the company has not separately tracked internal costs  which were primarily associated with payroll costs 
the company expects future costs to be funded by internally generated funds 
the company has begun to communicate with its major customers  suppliers and financial institutions to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
the feedback from some of the company s major suppliers and customers contacted confirmed that they anticipate being year compliant on or before december the company currently expects that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  delays in the implementation of the new systems  a failure to identify all of the year dependencies in the company s systems and in the systems of its suppliers  customers and financial institutions  or a failure of such third parties to adequately address their respective year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
therefore  the company expects to develop contingency plans  as the testing and implementation phases near completion  for continuing operations in the event such problems arise 
however  there can be no assurance that such contingency plans will be sufficient to handle all of the problems  which may arise 
factors affecting the company s prospects in addition to other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
this report contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
risks relating to conversion to the dms model 
none of the founding companies or subsequent acquisitions have been fully converted to the dms model 
the company intends to complete the conversion of the founding companies and subsequent acquisitions to the dms model to the extent feasible 
the process of converting an existing point to point courier operation to the dms model involves the implementation of the free call dispatch system as well as the integration of new software systems  pricing structures  billing methods  personnel utilization practices and data standardization 
changes in the pricing structures and billing methods could result in the loss of customers 
the process of conversion in a particular market may involve unforeseen difficulties  including delays in the consolidation of facilities  complications and expenses in implementing the new operating software system  or the loss of customers or key operating personnel  any of which can cause substantial delays to the conversion process in such particular market and may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the timing of any acquisitions of additional point to point courier firms and their respective conversion to the dms model may have a significant impact on the company s financial results  particularly in quarters immediately following such acquisitions 
absence of combined operating history  risks of integration 
the company was founded in september  and prior to the consummation of the offering in february conducted no operations other than in connection with the offering and the combinations  and generated no revenues other than receipt of licensing fees relating to the software company previously acquired by the company 
acquisitions made by the company are typically integrated into existing operating centers  although they can also operate as separate  independent businesses 
there can be no assurance that the company or any of the acquisitions will be profitable in the future 
the process of integrating acquired businesses often involves unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of the company s financial and other resources  including management time 
the company has experienced delays  complications and unanticipated expenses in implementing  integrating and operating such systems 
the success of the company will depend  in part  on the extent to which the company is able to institute and centralize accounting and other administrative functions such as billing  collections and cash management  implement financial controls  eliminate the unnecessary duplication of other functions and otherwise integrate the founding companies  and such additional businesses the company may acquire in the future  into a cohesive  efficient enterprise 
there can be no assurance that the company s senior management group will be able to successfully integrate  profitably manage or achieve anticipated cost savings from the combined operations of the founding companies or implement the company s business  internal and acquisition growth strategies 
the inability of the company to successfully integrate any of the acquired companies would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of tax authorities classifying independent contractors as employees 
a significant number of the couriers utilized by the company are independent contractors 
from time to time  federal and state taxing authorities have sought to assert that couriers in the point to point delivery industry are employees  rather than independent contractors 
the company does not pay or withhold any federal or state employment tax with respect to or on behalf of independent contractors 
the company believes that the independent contractors utilized by the company are not employees of the company under existing interpretations of federal and state laws 
however  there can be no assurance that federal and state authorities will not challenge this position  or that other laws or regulations  including tax laws  or interpretations thereof  will not change 
if the irs successfully asserts that such persons or others classified by the company as independent contractors are in fact employees of the company  the company would be required to pay withholding taxes and administer added employee benefits 
in addition  the company could become responsible for certain past and future employment taxes 
if the company is required to pay back up withholding taxes with respect to amounts previously paid to such persons  it may be required to pay penalties or be subject to other liability as a result of incorrectly classifying such couriers 
if the couriers are deemed to be employees  rather than independent contractors  then the company may be required to increase their gross compensation since they will be subject to state or federal tax withholdings 
any of the foregoing circumstances could increase the company s operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth 
the company expects to expand its existing business while continuing to integrate its prior acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company s management and financial reporting systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations as they expand 
any future growth also will impose significant added responsibilities on members of senior management  including the need to identify  recruit and integrate additional management and employees 
there can be no assurance that such additional management and employees will be identified and retained by the company 
to the extent that the company is unable to manage its growth efficiently and effectively  or is unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely effected 
risks relating to the company s acquisition strategy 
although the company s focus is on internal growth  one of the company s additional growth strategies has been to increase its revenues and profitability and expand the markets it serves through the selective acquisition of additional point to point courier businesses 
under the amended and restated credit facility dated april th   the company is severely restricted from making additional acquisitions 
the company does not therefore anticipate consummating new acquisitions in the foreseeable future 
several large  national publicly traded companies are consolidating the delivery industry through the acquisition of independent point to point courier companies 
as a result  competition for acquisition candidates is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively for acquisition candidates on terms deemed acceptable to the company 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully convert newly acquired businesses to the dms model and integrate such businesses into the company without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
in addition  there can be no assurance that companies acquired in the future either will be beneficial to the successful implementation of the company s overall strategy or will ultimately produce returns that justify the investment therein  or that the company will be successful in achieving meaningful economies of scale through the acquisitions thereof 
further  acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including possible adverse effects on the company s operating results and the timing of those results  diversion of management s attention  dependence on retention  hiring and training of key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities  and the realization of intangible assets  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the consummation of such transactions 
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems at a single acquired company could also have an adverse effect on the reputation of the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the founding companies or other point to point courier companies acquired in the future will achieve the anticipated levels of revenues and earnings 
to the extent that the company is unable to acquire additional point to point courier firms or integrate acquired businesses successfully  the company s ability to expand its operations and increase its revenues would be reduced 
factors affecting internal growth 
certain of the founding companies and other companies acquired in have individually experienced significant revenue and earnings growth over the past few years 
there can be no assurance that these companies will continue to experience internal growth comparable to these levels  if at all 
from time to time  certain of the acquired companies have been unable to hire and train as many couriers or operating and sales personnel as necessary to meet the increasing demands of these businesses 
factors affecting the ability of each of these acquired companies to experience continued internal growth includes  but are not limited to  the continued relationships with existing customers  the ability to expand the customer base  the ability to recruit and retain qualified couriers  operating and sales personnel  continued access to capital and the ability to cross sell services between the acquired companies 
need for additional financing 
should the lenders providing the amended and restated credit facility prevent the company from making acquisitions  the company would reconsider the merits of an acquisition program and would finance such acquisitions by using a combination of shares of its common stock and cash 
in the event that the common stock of the company does not attain a sufficient market value  or potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept the company s common stock as part of or all of the consideration to be paid for their business  the company would be required to utilize its cash resources  if available  to operate an acquisition program 
if the company has insufficient cash resources to pursue acquisitions  its growth could be limited unless it is able to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing if and when it is needed or that  if available  such financing could be obtained on terms the company deems acceptable 
the inability to obtain such financing could negatively impact such an acquisition program and have a resulting material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of irs challenge of reimbursement policies 
several of the acquired companies in the past have reimbursed certain automobile expenses of their drivers who are employees and own their vehicles 
aero delivery and two other founding companies  which collectively represent approximately of the company s consolidated revenues  previously had a reimbursement policy that was not based on actual mileage 
in connection with an audit of aero delivery  the irs challenged this type policy and the treatment of such payments as reimbursed expenses  and asserted that the reimbursements constitute additional compensation to the couriers on which the company should withhold certain taxes 
there can be no assurance that the irs will not be able to successfully challenge this type of policy if any other acquired company is presently practicing or has practiced this particular policy in the past and that this would not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for which the company will not be adequately covered by indemnification from the founding companies 
risk of inability to terminate unsatisfactory brand managers in a timely fashion 
the company operates certain of the companies acquired through compensation and incentive arrangements with former owners of the acquired companies brand managers  known as brand manager agreements 
each brand manager is responsible for managing his or her brand to maximize its revenues and profit margin 
the brand manager agreement can be terminated by the company under certain limited conditions based on performance 
the company is presently attempting to convert a number of the brand manager contracts into center manager contracts  which effectively replace existing arrangements with a new compensation and incentive structure based on the pre tax performance of an entire operating center center manager contracts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to renegotiate the brand manager contracts  or terminate in a timely manner any brand manager or center manager who is not performing as expected and that such inability would not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of loss of customers due to increased prices 
the implementation of the dms model is intended to enable the company to offer a higher level of customer service than its competitors 
the prices that the company may charge for such services could be greater than the prices currently being charged customers for services they are currently receiving 
there can be no assurance that customers will not decline to purchase the services to be offered by the company  thereby adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limitations on access to radio channels 
the company relies to a significant extent on the use of two way radio channels to communicate with its courier fleet 
such radio channels are made available  on a limited basis  by local government authorities and the federal communications commission 
accordingly  providers of the transmission networks for the radio channels may have the ability to restrict  or substantially increase the costs with respect to  the company s use or access to the radio channels 
the company may  at its own expense  be required to incur substantial costs to obtain  build or maintain its own transmission networks in the event that third party owners of the current transmission networks restrict or otherwise obstruct the company s access to radio channels 
any increases in the costs of radio transmission  obstruction of current radio channel service or any need for the company to build its own transmission networks could severely inhibit the company s ability to deliver point to point delivery services and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims exposure 
the company is exposed to claims for personal injury  death and property damage as a result of automobile  bicycle and other accidents involving its employees and independent contractors 
the company may also be subject to claims resulting from the non delivery or delayed delivery of packages  many of which claims could be significant because of the unique or time sensitive nature of the deliveries 
the company intends to carry liability insurance and independent contractors are required to maintain the minimum amounts of liability insurance required by state law 
however  there can be no assurance that claims will not exceed the amount of coverage 
in addition  the company s visibility and financial strength as a public company may create additional claims exposure 
if the company were to experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents  liability claims  workers compensation claims or unfavorable resolution of claims  the company s insurance costs could significantly increase and operating results could be negatively affected 
in addition  future claims against the company or one of the acquired companies could negatively affect the company s reputation and could have a correspondingly material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with the point to point delivery industry  general economic conditions 
the company s revenues and earnings are especially sensitive to events that affect the delivery services industry  including extreme weather conditions  economic factors affecting the company s significant customers  increases in fuel prices and shortages of or disputes with labor  any of which could result in the company s inability to service its clients effectively or the inability of the company to profitably manage its operations 
in addition  demand for the company s services may be negatively impacted by downturns in the level of general economic activity and employment in the united states  united kingdom  australia or new zealand 
the development and increased popularity of facsimile machines and electronic mail via the internet has recently reduced the demand for certain types of point to point delivery services  including those offered by the company 
as a result  point to point courier firms are increasingly dependent upon delivery requests for items that are unable to be delivered via alternative methods 
there can be no assurance that similar industry wide developments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
effect of potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company may experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its results of operations 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of the integration of the founding companies and other acquired companies and their conversion to the dms model  the demand for the company s services  the timing and introduction of new services or service enhancements by the company or its competitors  the market acceptance of new services  competitive conditions in the industry and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of the results that the company may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year 
such quarterly fluctuations may result in volatility in the market price of the common stock of the company  and it is possible that in future quarters the company s results of operations could be below the expectations of the public market 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock of the company 
several of the acquired companies recorded a net loss for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to acquisition by the company 
no assurance can be given that these acquired companies will become profitable in the future or that their respective financial performance will be accretive to the company s earnings 
risk of non proprietary elements of the dms model 
substantially all of the key elements of the dms model have been described in various public forums  such as trade shows and industry publications  and also have been made available to companies that are or have been licensees of the company but are not founding companies or subsidiaries of the company 
although the software used in the dms model is proprietary  all of the other key elements of the dms model cannot be protected by patents or trademarks 
therefore  there can be no assurance that other point to point courier companies will not be able to effectively replicate the dms model and implement it more effectively than the company and at a lower cost 
dependence on technology 
the company s business is dependent upon a number of different information and telecommunication technologies to operate the dms model  manage a high volume of inbound and outbound calls and process transactions accurately and on a timely basis 
any impairment of the company s ability to process transactions on an accurate and timely basis could result in the loss of customers and diminish the reputation of the company 
historically  many of the founding companies and the other companies acquired in operated on separate computer and telephone systems  several of which utilize different technologies 
the integration of these companies to the company s operating model has been more costly than expected  and there can be no assurance that the integration of these systems and conversion to the company s proprietary software will be successful or completed without additional unexpected costs 
there can also be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to design  develop and refine its computer systems and software on a cost efficient basis  whether due to the loss of employees or otherwise 
any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company utilizes computer hardware and operating systems designed and manufactured by apple computer  inc apple 
any material changes in computer and operating platform technology designed and manufactured by apple which is incompatible with the company s current computer systems  or the discontinuance of apple computer hardware or support services  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the company decides to change its hardware and operating systems to a different operating platform technology  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully make such a change or that such new hardware and operating systems will be as effective as the existing hardware and operating system 
dependence on availability of qualified courier personnel 
the company is dependent upon its ability to attract  train and retain  as employees or through independent contractor or other arrangements  qualified courier personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the needs of its operations 
the company competes in markets in which unemployment is relatively low and the competition for couriers and other employees is intense 
the company must continually evaluate  train and upgrade its pool of available couriers to keep pace with demands for delivery services 
there can be no assurance that qualified courier personnel will continue to be available in sufficient numbers and on terms acceptable to the company 
the inability to attract and retain qualified courier personnel would have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on key personnel 
the company s success is largely dependent on the efforts and relationships of the company s chief executive officer  the executive officers  senior managers of the founding and acquired companies  brand managers and center managers 
furthermore  the company will likely be dependent on the senior management of any businesses acquired in the future  particularly the selling shareholder and sales representatives who have on going relationships with customers 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that such individuals will continue in their present capacity for any particular period of time 
the company does not intend to obtain key man life insurance covering any of its executive officers or other members of senior management 
in addition  the company s future success and plans for growth also depend on the company s ability to attract  train and retain skilled personnel in all areas of its business 
competition 
the market for point to point delivery services is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry 
many of the company s competitors operate in only one location and may have more experience and brand recognition than the company in such local market 
in addition  several large  national  publicly traded companies are in the process of consolidating the point to point delivery industry through the acquisition of independent point to point courier companies 
other companies in the industry compete with the company not only for the provision of services but also for acquisition candidates 
some of these companies have longer operating histories and greater financial resources than the company 
in addition  other firms involved in segments other than point to point delivery services may expand into this market in order to provide their customers with one stop shopping of delivery and logistics services 
many of such companies have greater financial resources and brand name recognition than the company 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on key markets 
a significant portion of the company s revenues and profitability are attributable to services rendered in the metropolitan new york city new jersey  united kingdom  and san francisco markets 
revenues from the new york city new jersey  london  and san francisco markets accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  therefore  the company s results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in the general economic and business cycles in these markets 
the company s reliance on these individual markets makes it susceptible to risks that it would not otherwise be exposed to if it operated in a more geographically diverse market 
the company believes that it will be susceptible to geographic concentration risks for the foreseeable future 
risk of business interruptions and dependence on single facilities in a market 
the company believes that its future results of operations will be dependent in large part on its ability to provide prompt and efficient service to its customers 
upon conversion of the company to the dms model  the company s operations typically will be performed at a single dms operating center for each respective metropolitan market it services and  therefore  the operation of such dms centers is dependent on continuous computer  electrical and telephone service 
as a result  any disruption of the company s day to day operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
permits and licensing 
the company s operations are subject to various state  local and federal regulations that  in many instances  require permits and licenses 
additionally  some of the company s operations may involve the delivery of items subject to more stringent regulation  including hazardous materials  requiring the company to obtain additional permits 
the failure of the company to maintain required permits and licenses  or to comply with applicable regulations  could result in substantial fines or revocation of the company s permits and licenses which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  delays in obtaining approvals for the transfer or grant of permits or licenses  or failure to obtain such approvals could delay or impede the company s acquisition program 
regulatory compliance 
as a public company  the company is subject to continuing compliance with federal securities laws and may also be subject to increased scrutiny with respect to laws applicable to all businesses  such as employment  safety and environmental regulations 
certain of the company s management have limited experience in managing a public company 
there can be no assurance that management will be able to effectively and timely implement programs and policies that adequately respond to such legal and regulatory compliance requirements 
foreign exchange 
approximately of the company s consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were derived from operations conducted in the united kingdom  australia and new zealand 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound  australian dollar  and new zealand dollar  result in fluctuations in the amounts relating to the foreign currencies reported in the company s consolidated financial statements due to repatriation of earnings from the foreign subsidiary to the united states or translation of the earnings of the foreign subsidiary operations into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
the company has not entered into any hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency exposure  but it may do so in the future 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
interest expense 
the company had significant variable interest rate debt outstanding at december  and will continue to have a significant amount of variable rate debt 
the company has not currently entered into any hedging transactions with respect to its interest rate exposure  although it may do so in the future 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
development of new services 
the company believes that its long term success depends on its ability to enhance its current services  develop new services that utilize the dms model and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
the failure of the company to develop and introduce enhancements and new services in a timely and cost effective manner in response to changing technologies  customer requirements or increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
potential liability for breach of confidentiality 
a substantial portion of the company s business involves the handling of documents containing confidential and other sensitive information 
there can be no assurance that unauthorized disclosure will not result in liability to the company 
it is possible that such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial conditions or results of operations 
dividend policy 
the company anticipates that for the foreseeable future  its earnings will be retained for the operation and expansion of its business and that it will not pay cash dividends 
in addition  the company s credit facility agreement precludes the payment of cash dividends without the lender s consent 
year issues 
the year issue could disrupt the company s business and adversely affect the company s financial condition 
the year issue refers to a number of date related problems that may affect information technology and non information technology systems  including codes embedded in chips and other hardware devices 
these problems include systems that identify a year by two digits and not four so that a date would be recognized as rather than this could result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruptions of operations or other business problems  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
the year issue is a significant issue for most  if not all companies  with far reaching implications  some of which cannot be anticipated or predicted with any degree of certainty 
we have not completed our evaluation of the year exposure  see year for a detailed discussion of the year issue 
nasdaq listing

the national market imposes certain requirements for continued listing  including the maintenance of a minimum bid price  number of market makers  market capitalization  and free float 
at march   the company was in discussion with the nasdaq concerning certain of the listing requirements  however  there can be no assurance that such discussions will ensure continued listing  or that the inability to maintain the continued national market listing will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or equity valuation
