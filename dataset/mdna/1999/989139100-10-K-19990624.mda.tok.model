item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations in millions of canadian dollars  except per share amounts the following discussion and analysis explains trends in mitel s financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  compared with the two previous fiscal years 
this discussion is intended to help shareholders and other readers understand the dynamics of mitel s business and the key factors underlying its financial results 
the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary information constitute an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis 
readers may wish to make reference to the glossary of terms on page of the annual report to assist in their understanding of this discussion 
net income for the three fiscal years ended march   march  and march  as determined by us accounting principles is detailed and discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
overview of recent significant events mitel has completed four acquisitions since august two acquisitions occurred during fiscal and the others were completed mid way through the first quarter of fiscal the most significant transaction occurred on february  when mitel acquired gec plessey semiconductors group plessey  an international semiconductor company serving primarily the communications and media markets 
the other acquisitions related to the mitel communications systems systems business group 
the acquisitions by the systems group centered on remote access technologies  advanced voice and unified messaging solutions  and isdn business products for the small to medium enterprise market 
mitel is focused on integrating and streamlining these new businesses to accelerate its strategy of providing new products for the convergence of telephony  data  and other media technologies 
the plessey operations included a business segment known as the lincoln power and automotive lincoln group 
management began an evaluation of lincoln s operations at the time of acquisition in light of its position outside mitel s strategic focus on communications 
following an extensive strategic review of mitel s semiconductor operations  management formalized a plan at the end of fiscal to sell or otherwise exit the lincoln operations 
accordingly  lincoln was reclassified as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal and will continue to be reported as such until the group is sold as a going concern or otherwise disposed of  an event which management expects to occur within the next twelve months 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mitel revised its estimated amortization periods for intangible assets  consistent with evolving industry practices 
such measure will allow mitel s assets to be in better alignment with the technological and competitive dynamics of the communications industry 
management regularly reviews the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles in addition to any related asset impairment 
management believes the reduced amortization time period  to two years from the previous estimate of five to fifteen years  better reflects the estimated time to market advantage achieved by the recent acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mitel also implemented certain rationalization plans  described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis  and realized gains related to the sale of certain semiconductor technology assets 
the net pre tax charge to mitel s operations as a result of these actions amounted to on july   mitel repaid against the us dollar term loans incurred in connection with the plessey acquisition 
the repayment was required under terms of the associated credit agreement as proceeds of were received from an equity offering 
accordingly  a proportionate amount of the related deferred debt issue costs and deferred foreign exchange losses was recorded as additional interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal this non cash expense reduced net income from continuing operations by  or per share 
results of operations mitel s business is global and comprises the design  manufacture and sale of networked systems and specialty semiconductor products for the communications industry 
mitel operates through two reportable business segments mitel communications systems and mitel semiconductor semiconductor 
mitel sells its products through both direct and indirect channels of distribution 
factors affecting the choice of distribution  among others  include end customer type  the level of product complexity and integration requirements  the stage of product introduction  geographic presence and location of markets  and volume levels 
mitel s strategy is centered on developing strong microelectronics technology and advancing people to people communications in an open  distributed and standards based environment 
mitel communications systems provides enterprises with voice and data communications systems  complete private networks  including remote teleworking solutions  unified messaging and call center applications  cti systems and applications  and it also supplies competitive carriers with public network access products 
all of mitel s service revenue relates to systems 
mitel semiconductor provides connectivity solutions for the communications and medical industries with a product range which includes components for both wired and wireless networks  microelectronics for enabling the convergence of voice and data  optoelectronic devices for high speed internet systems  and  also  applications specific integrated circuits asics for medical applications such as pacemakers and hearing aids 
mitel s revenue reached a record high in fiscal due to recently acquired businesses and to strong systems sales in europe and north america 
total revenue grew by percent from fiscal by business group  semiconductor revenue from continuing operations grew by percent and systems revenue was up percent from the previous year 
the semiconductor growth rate was mainly attributable to the inclusion of sales of the former plessey group  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  for the full fiscal year in higher sales volumes of pbx systems  telephone sets and alternate network access products and the effects of consolidating recent acquisitions drove the systems revenue growth 
millions of cdn dollars consolidated revenue systems segment revenue semiconductor segment revenue net income from continuing operations net income per common share from continuing operations net income net income per common share adjusted net income adjusted net income per common share adjusted net income excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles  special charges net  non cash debt issue and other costs expensed on an early partial debt repayment  and discontinued operations 
although not a substitute for net income or net income per common share  management utilizes adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share as a supplementary measure to assess financial performance 
net income the lower net income in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to incremental amortization charges of  or per share  arising from revisions in the estimated useful lives of acquired intangibles to better reflect the time to market advantage expected by management from the related acquisitions 
in addition  mitel recognized an estimated loss of  or per share  on the planned disposal of the lincoln operations  upon adoption of a formal plan to exit that business segment 
mitel also implemented plans in the fourth quarter of fiscal to rationalize certain of its systems operations  partially offset by a gain on the sale of certain non strategic technology and other assets to result in a net charge of  or per share 
net income was also negatively impacted in fiscal due to a charge to continuing operations of  or per share  representing a proportionate amount of debt issue and other costs expensed in connection with an early partial debt repayment in the second quarter of fiscal the early repayment was required to be made under the terms of a credit agreement out of the proceeds received from the july equity offering 
adjusted net income adjusted net income  as defined above  was lower in fiscal than in fiscal by  or per share 
the reduction in adjusted net income was due to increased interest expense of  or per share  on the syndicated term loans entered into to acquire plessey  the effects of reduced semiconductor sales in the asia pacific region  increased amortization and excess capacity associated with the additional plessey microelectronics fabrication facilities fabs 
adjusted net income per common share was also negatively impacted by a higher number of weighted average common shares outstanding 
mitel issued million additional shares through an equity offering in july these factors  which contributed to the lower adjusted net income  were partially offset by the strong systems performance in north america and europe 
unless otherwise noted  the following discussion pertains to mitel s continuing operations 
revenue business segment review mitel communications systems millions cdn systems revenue products service compared to fiscal  systems product revenue in fiscal increased by percent  from to  due to higher sales volumes of sx and sx systems  including the associated pull through of system sets  increased shipments of alternate network access products and additional revenues from the advanced messaging and isdn pbx businesses acquired in the first quarter of fiscal us indirect channel sales benefited from increased demand by the small to medium sized business segment for mitel s sx ml and sx el switches 
in addition  mitel launched a new line of telephone sets in early fiscal that also produced additional revenue 
us direct channel sales benefited from increased installations of new systems as well as from upgrades in the existing customer base 
with respect to europe  sales increased in fiscal due to strong growth in new system sales and system upgrades sold to the installed base  and to continued higher demand for mitel s alternate network access products 
service revenue grew mainly due to the managed service business in the united kingdom where telecom product related services are channeled through outsourcing companies 
systems sales into the asia pacific region continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing effects of weakened economies and intense price competition in that region 
in proportion to total revenue  systems service revenue decreased to percent of total revenue compared to percent of total revenue last year 
this decrease is mainly due to the effects of consolidating plessey which is comprised of only product revenue 
management expects that service revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  will continue to decrease in future periods due to the growing significance of product sales in relation to total sales 
fiscal total systems revenue increased by percent to from fiscal s revenue of the revenue growth was due to increased demand for alternate network access products  higher sx and sx sales through the us indirect channel and incremental sales of remote access products 
mitel semiconductor as a percentage of total revenue  semiconductors accounted for percent  percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal years   and millions cdn semiconductor revenue semiconductor revenue from continuing operations in fiscal increased by percent from fiscal principally due to the effects of consolidating the operations of plessey  acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal management believes the plessey acquisition has significantly enhanced mitel s operations  technologies and product portfolio 
the plessey acquisition also provided mitel with enhanced market penetration in europe  resulting in an increase in total revenues generated in europe by percent from last year 
this acquisition also had the effect of reducing the proportion of total revenue recorded in the united states from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal excluding the growth resulting from the plessey acquisition  mitel has experienced certain pricing pressures in addition to reduced demand from the asia pacific region and other emerging regions  such as latin america and eastern europe  due to the prevailing adverse local economic conditions see further discussion under other 
this recent decline and the additional manufacturing capability acquired from plessey combined to result in excess capacity in mitel s fabs 
management undertook a strategic review of its operations and is taking the steps necessary to consolidate the capacity levels to achieve better utilization of the fabs and to realize the synergies in the combined semiconductor operations 
when mitel acquired plessey  the company recorded provisions of in respect of integration costs 
the integration costs related to initial estimates to exit the lincoln power and automotive business segment  the transfer of redundant production activities from sweden to plymouth  uk  and to severance costs for redundancies in the acquired semiconductor segment throughout the world 
at the end of fiscal  following the completion of mitel s semiconductor strategic review  mitel adopted a formal plan to pursue divestiture opportunities related to the distinct and non core operations of lincoln  either by sale as a going concern or by closing the operations 
accordingly  the operations related to this business were accounted for as discontinued operations 
an additional estimated after tax loss of on the expected and ultimate disposal of lincoln was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in may  mitel reached an agreement with the relevant swedish trade unions concerning the transfer of all semiconductor cmos manufacturing operations from sweden to mitel s other more technologically advanced fabrication sites 
the proposed transfer affects approximately employees in mitel s plant in jarfalla  sweden with the program expected to be completed within the next twelve months 
the swedish operation will operate as an ic fabless facility focused on the design  marketing and sales of asics and as a manufacturer and marketer of optoelectronic devices 
mitel continues to evaluate the adequacy of its integration and redundancy provisions through the implementation process of realizing synergies and integrating recently acquired businesses 
fiscal semiconductor revenue increased over fiscal by percent as a result of increased demand for the company s integrated circuits and thick film hybrid products  primarily in the us and asia pacific regions  and the effects of consolidating plessey mid way through the fourth quarter of fiscal geographic revenues revenue during the last three fiscal years  based on the geographic location of mitel s customers  was distributed as follows millions cdn united states europe other regions canada for the year ended march   the net movement in exchange rates from fiscal favorably impacted total revenue by percent primarily as a result of changes in the uk pound sterling and uk dollar exchange rates 
fiscal revenue was favorably impacted by percent as a result of changes in the uk pound sterling and uk dollar exchange rates 
united states sales into the united states   increased by percent in fiscal over fiscal the increase was due  in part  to higher sx systems and associated sets sales and to higher voice messaging solutions revenue resulting from the acquisition of centigram communications corporation s customer premise equipment business in may of higher semiconductor revenue also contributed to the growth in this region as a result of including a full year of sales in fiscal from the former plessey operations 
sales increased by percent in the united states in fiscal over fiscal principally due to the systems business 
higher sx and sx system sales through the indirect channel and the effects of consolidating sales resulting from the august acquisition of gandalf technologies inc s remote access business drove most of the increase 
europe european sales   increased by percent in fiscal over fiscal due to the effects of including a full year of the former plessey group s results 
systems revenue in this region increased on higher alternate network access products sold to long distance carriers and to higher shipments of sx and sx systems in the united kingdom 
fiscal revenue into europe increased by percent over fiscal on higher alternate network access sales  higher pbx system sales  and to the effects of consolidating plessey towards the end of fiscal canada canadian sales   increased by percent in fiscal over fiscal on higher semiconductor sales from the former plessey operations and to higher sx and sets sales in the systems group 
the sales increase in canada from fiscal to fiscal was percent 
other regions sales into other regions   increased by percent principally due to higher semiconductor sales into the asia pacific region which more than offset lower system sales in that area 
fiscal s increase of percent in sales into other regions over fiscal was due to higher ic sales in asia pacific and to the effects of consolidating plessey mid way through the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin as a percentage of total revenue  total gross margin was percent in fiscal  and percent in fiscal and fiscal the lower fiscal gross margin was negatively impacted by a higher proportion of manufacturing asset amortization expense driven by the recently acquired fabs  in addition to reduced margins in some semiconductor products and to certain unfavorable manufacturing variances resulting from the fabs excess capacity 
the positive impacts of higher sales volumes of systems products helped to reduce the negative impact of lower semiconductor margins 
the fiscal gross margin remained stable relative to fiscal the positive impact of higher sales volumes in systems and semiconductor products and of efficiency improvements in systems integration services helped to offset lower average selling prices in certain systems products in fiscal operating expenses selling and administrative selling and administrative s a expenses from continuing operations in fiscal were  or percent of sales  compared with  or percent of sales  in fiscal in fiscal  s a expenses were  or percent of sales 
s a expenses from continuing operations decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to revenue growth and the inclusion of the former plessey operations where s a expenses as a percentage of sales were lower than mitel s historical average 
the improvement was partially offset by the effects of consolidating the recently acquired advanced messaging and isdn pbx businesses 
fiscal s a expenses from continuing operations decreased as a percentage of sales from fiscal primarily due to strong revenue growth  spending restraints applied to marketing programs  higher efficiencies and focus in the sales channels and reduced corporate overhead costs 
the improvement was partially offset by the effects of integrating the former plessey operations and the other acquired remote access technology businesses 
research and development r d r d expenses from continuing operations amounted to  or percent of revenue  for the year ended march  this compares to and  or and percent of revenue  in the respective fiscal years of and these amounts were net of  in r d government assistance  including itcs 
r d increased due to the inclusion for a full fiscal year of the results of operations of the former plessey group where r d as a percentage of sales was higher than mitel s historical average  and to higher spending in mitel s other semiconductor operations 
millions cdn r d expenses special charges net during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mitel recorded a net pre tax special charge of comprising actions to rationalize certain aspects of the systems group  net of a gain arising from the sale of certain non strategic technology and other assets 
the systems actions reflected efforts to streamline north american and european sales channels  and to transfer the network access product manufacturing operations from north america to the united kingdom  where the majority of the sales are generated 
also included in the charge was the cost of severance and related benefits  with the majority of the reduction taking place in the north american and far east regions 
approximately people are to be terminated as part of this rationalization program 
all of these activities are expected to be substantially completed by december as at march   of severance  benefits  facilities and other costs had been paid 
amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangibles increased in fiscal to from in fiscal the estimated useful life of acquired intangibles was reduced to two years from an average of five to fifteen years to better reflect the estimated period of advantage achieved by mitel s recent acquisitions  and to be in line with evolving industry practices 
the revision of the estimated useful life accounted for of the total increase 
the remainder of the increase over fiscal resulted from the advanced messaging and isdn pbx businesses acquired in the first quarter of fiscal investment and interest income investment and interest income was for the year ended march  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal average cash balances and interest rates remained relatively stable to result in only a minor increase in interest income over last year 
the fiscal decrease from fiscal was due to a gain realized from the sale of a non strategic investment in esprit telecom jersey ltd 
esprit 
esprit was sold in fiscal for cash proceeds of  representing a total gain of  or after tax 
interest expense interest expense from continuing operations  including of non cash debt issue and other costs expensed in connection with the partial debt repayment described below  was for fiscal compared to and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in interest resulted from the term loans incurred by the company on february  in connection with the plessey acquisition 
on july   mitel repaid against the us dollar term loans 
accordingly  a proportionate amount of the related deferred debt issue costs and deferred foreign exchange losses from continuing operations was recorded as additional interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal income taxes income tax expense for fiscal was compared to and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective income tax rate  as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations  was percent  percent and percent in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increased effective tax rate in fiscal was due to higher non deductible intangible asset amortization  partially offset by permanent differences associated with european operations  lower taxes in canada arising from higher interest costs related to the term loans  and to tax recoveries in sweden 
the fiscal effective tax rate was lower than in fiscal due to a lower uk group tax position  partially offset by higher provincial income taxes in canada 
backlog as orders are frequently booked and shipped within the same fiscal month  order backlog is not necessarily indicative of a sales outlook for the month  quarter  or year 
this is most true for systems since manufacturing lead times for semiconductor products are generally longer because of the nature of the production process 
at march   order backlog from continuing operations was  down from at march  the decrease in backlog was attributable to a decrease in semiconductor orders arising partly from a reduction in order lead times 
most of the backlog is scheduled for delivery in the next twelve months 
millions cdn backlog compared to fiscal  the increase in backlog of from continuing operations at the end of fiscal was mostly attributable to the acquisition of plessey in the fourth quarter of that year and to increased systems bookings 
liquidity and capital resources mitel had cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances of at march  compared to at march  all of the march  cash balance was held in either cash or highly liquid cash equivalents 
the decrease of was mainly due to the first quarter acquisitions of the advanced messaging and isdn pbx businesses which  together  amounted to  and charges to provisions related to integration costs for the plessey operations  which were offset  in part  by net proceeds retained from the equity offering completed in the second quarter of fiscal mitel has two term loans  respectively the axelssm series b loan and the tranche a term loan  that were entered into on february  with a syndicate of banks led by goldman  sachs credit partners lp as the syndication agent and the canadian imperial bank of commerce as the administrative agent 
the principal of the axels series b loan is payable quarterly on a graduated basis over five years and matures on december the principal of the tranche a term loan is payable quarterly on a graduated basis over five years and matures on february the term loans bear interest at a variable interest rate based on the lower of a defined base rate or the london inter bank offer rate libor plus a premium 
mitel entered into an interest rate swap to fix the base interest rate on a portion of each of the term loans 
the interest rate swap is considered to be an effective hedge of the variable interest rates on the term loans 
mitel is subject to certain restrictive covenants and commitments and is required to maintain certain financial ratios for the purpose of ensuring mitel s ability to meet its obligations under the credit agreement 
the term loans are subject to mandatory prepayments out of certain insurance proceeds  and defined excess cash flow received by mitel and in the event of asset sales other than inventory  equity offerings or debt issuance by mitel 
mandatory prepayments range from percent to percent of the net cash proceeds and would be paid on a pro rata basis subject to certain constraints toward the senior secured term loans 
management believes mitel is in compliance with the obligations and restrictive covenants under the credit agreement 
on july   mitel  through a syndicate of underwriters  issued million common shares  at a price of per share  for total proceeds of net proceeds to mitel were  of which was applied to repay a portion of the term loans 
the balance of the proceeds was retained for general corporate purposes 
cash flow from operations before working capital changes amounted to during fiscal compared to in fiscal since march   mitel s working capital  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  increased by primarily due to higher receivables and inventory levels related to the growth in the business and payments made against the plessey integration provisions 
mitel maintains a minimum of critical inventory to ensure continuity of supply for its manufacturing requirements 
most of the security supply inventory is carried at mitel s semiconductor plants 
fixed asset and other additions were during fiscal compared with in the previous year  excluding additions of and financed by capital lease for the two respective periods 
the additions were primarily related to semiconductor manufacturing capacity and technology enhancements as well as continuing improvements to mitel s information technology resources 
long term debt decreased due to scheduled repayments of and a prepayment of against the term loans described above 
as at march   mitel s capitalization was comprised of percent debt  percent preferred equity  and percent common equity 
this compares to percent debt  percent preferred equity  and percent common equity at the end of fiscal in addition to cash and cash equivalent balances of as at march   mitel has an unused revolving credit facility of approximately us 
management believes mitel is in a position to meet all foreseeable business cash requirements and debt service from its cash balances on hand  existing financing facilities and cash flow from operations 
year what is referred to as the year problem year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  resulting in the possibility that computer systems and products that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
mitel has been working on the year problem since a dedicated year program management office pmo was established in february to address compliance both externally  to our customers and suppliers  and internally for mitel s business processes 
mitel s internal processes include network and communications infrastructure  business software applications  manufacturing  distribution  facilities management  product development  sales  finance and human resources 
management presently believes that with modifications to mitel s existing software and hardware and conversions to new software  the year problem can be mitigated 
despite the extensive efforts dedicated to the year program  there can be no assurance that all year date compliance activities will be completed before problems associated with the year transition potentially occur 
mitel has completed the evaluation of its major product offerings  including current and discontinued business telephone systems  peripherals and applications 
the majority of products have been classified as compliant or having compliant versions 
mitel has established a three phase year readiness program the year program that addresses its key internal business processes and systems 
phase i was the initial assessment and included an overview of mitel and an assessment of its awareness and readiness for year consultants were engaged to assist with this review and with any necessary remedial plans 
phase ii was referred to as the discovery and strategy and involved the collection and assessment of a comprehensive inventory of all internal information systems equipment as well as a detailed assessment of the suppliers deemed to be affected by the year problem 
the third and current phase is the implementation and consists of conversion  testing and deployment of identified mission critical systems as well as risk and contingency management activities 
presently the majority of mitel s identified mission critical systems are year ready 
however  a small number of remediation projects are dependent upon third party vendor negotiations currently underway with certain specified software and hardware suppliers 
the remaining remediation projects are awaiting third party software and hardware upgrades  and are on schedule to be brought to a compliant status before the end of june mitel has started to address its non mission critical systems and plans to have the majority of these systems year ready by the end of calendar the integration testing of internal systems is also planned for the spring of calendar mitel also initiated an internal audit process under which most of its major sites are being visited to ensure corporate guidelines and procedures are consistently applied 
under its comprehensive vendor management program  initiated during phase ii of the year program  mitel is actively working with its suppliers to determine the extent to which their operations and the products and services they provide are year ready and to monitor their progress toward year capability 
the highest priority is given to suppliers that are critical to the business 
the program includes awareness letters  site visits  questionnaires as well as compliance agreement and warranties 
contingency plans  such as planned increased inventory levels or substitute suppliers  are being developed to address issues related to suppliers that are not considered to be making sufficient progress in becoming year capable in a timely manner 
mitel has also developed contingency plans to address possible changes in customer order patterns due to year issues 
management believes that mitel achieved its target to have all high risk suppliers assessments of their year readiness completed and to have necessary contingency plans in place by march  contingency plans will be reviewed on a regular basis as mitel learns more about its suppliers state of readiness 
mitel also conducts on going monitoring of local utility suppliers and is presently updating its comprehensive disaster recovery plan to accommodate year related issues 
mitel also initiated a comprehensive distribution management program in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in order to assess the year state of readiness of its distributors in a manner similar to its vendor management program 
the assessment phase is completed and contingency plans are presently being developed and should be completed by september it is currently expected that the total incremental direct costs of the year program will not exceed approximately has been spent on direct year program costs to date and was funded through operating cash flows 
the program costs are primarily attributable to the purchase of new software and equipment and do not include estimates for potential litigation 
as mitel continues to assess the last phases of the year program  estimated costs may change 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that the modifications and conversions discussed above  related to mitel s internal systems or products sold to customers  will have a material adverse impact on mitel s business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed on a timely basis  the year problem could have a material adverse effect on mitel s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios would relate to third party systems rather than mitel s internal systems or products 
mitel believes the risks are greatest with utilities eg electricity supply  water  telecommunications  transportation and critical suppliers that are outside mitel s control 
other asia pacific economic risk the asia pacific region encountered unstable local economies and significant devaluation in its currencies during fiscal and through fiscal this region represented percent of mitel s revenue from continuing operations for the year ended march  and percent of revenue from continuing operations in fiscal the majority of the asia pacific sales relate to semiconductor operations 
asia pacific receivables  net of reserves  were approximately percent of mitel s total assets as at march  to the extent the asia pacific region grows in importance to mitel  or that the factors affecting the region begin to adversely affect customers in other geographic locations  mitel s business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
foreign currency translation management periodically evaluates the financial and operational independence of its foreign operations and the resulting accounting classification of the foreign subsidiaries as self sustaining enterprises 
should a foreign subsidiary cease to be classified as self sustaining  then translation gains or losses on consolidating the foreign subsidiary s financial statements would be charged to operating income instead of a separate component of shareholders equity 
european union and the euro on january   eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro will trade on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
the conversion to the euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
mitel s operating subsidiaries that are affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and financial systems  competitive impacts of cross border price transparency  and recalculating currency risk 
mitel does not expect any required system conversion costs to be material due to the existing ability to transact in multiple currencies 
due to significant uncertainties  mitel cannot reasonably estimate the effects one common currency will have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on mitel s financial condition or its results of operations 
forward looking statements certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of mitel  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include  among others  the following general economic and business conditions  demographic changes  import protection and regulation  rapid technology development and changes  timing of product introductions  the mix of products services  industry competition  industry capacity and other industry trends  and the ability of mitel to attract and retain key employees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact mitel s financial statements due to adverse changes in financial markets 
mitel is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to manage these risks  mitel uses certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps  forward contracts and other derivative instruments from time to time  that have been authorized pursuant to board approved policies and procedures 
mitel does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
mitel currently uses forward contracts to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the most significant foreign exchange exposures for mitel relate to the united states dollar and the british pound 
at march   there was a net fair value of unrealized loss on all forward contracts  which is calculated as the difference between the actual contract rates and the applicable rate that would be used to terminate the contracts  if that became necessary 
additional potential losses in the net fair value of these contracts  assuming a percent depreciation in the us dollar against all currencies  at march   would have been approximately because these contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  management believes that these potential losses would be largely offset by gains on the underlying firmly committed or anticipated transaction 
interest rate swaps are used to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and also to lower overall borrowing costs 
mitel s main exposure to interest rate risk relates to its united states dollar denominated long term debt 
mitel monitors its interest rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value 
assuming a percent downward shift in interest rates at march   the potential loss in the net fair value of interest rate swaps and the underlying hedged debt would have been nil because these two items are equal and offsetting 
under the same assumption  the potential loss in the net change in fair value of unhedged debt would have been immaterial because substantially all of the united states dollar denominated long term debt is hedged 
in accordance with mitel policy  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are primarily comprised of high grade money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than one year 
the estimated potential losses  as discussed above  assume the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
they do not consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors and do not represent projected losses in fair value that mitel expects to incur 
future impacts would be based on actual developments in global financial markets 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest and foreign exchange rate risks in the near future
