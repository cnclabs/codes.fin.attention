romac s estimate of the period that existing resources will fund its working capital requirements and the amount of stock that the company will actually be able to repurchase in the next months are forward looking statements that is subject to risks and uncertainties

year many computer systems in use today were designed and developed using two digits  rather than four  to specify years 
as a result  such systems will recognize the year as or this could cause many computer applications to fail completely or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
the company utilizes software and computer technologies that are essential to its operations 
the company continuously evaluates the ongoing and expected future business and industry requirements of its internally developed and externally purchased applications 
these applications and technology equipment are updated on a regular basis 
the company has not accelerated its plans to replace or update existing systems because of the year issue 
the company has implemented a four step process to address year issues consisting of assessment overview identify the issues  discovery inventory  categorize  and assess business impacts and risks  conversion make program changes  rollout new hardware  perform applications and acceptance testing  and certification  and deployment deploy program and hardware changes  evaluate and apply lessons learned 
after the company completed the assessment overview phase  the company hired an independent third party to perform the discovery phase and make recommendations on assessment of business risks 
this study concluded that the greatest risk faced by the company s internal systems are the hardware system that operates the telephone voicemail systems at certain locations and the wizard nt operating system software that must be upgraded from to service pak as of march   the company had substantially completed the assessment overview and discovery phases and is in process of the conversion phase 
the target date of the completion of the high risk area is expected to be june  the company is working with key third party vendors to understand their ability to continue to provide services and products through the change to the company intends to continue to partner with its key third party vendors to avoid any business interruptions in the company is dependent upon its customers for sales and cash flow 
the company currently does not believe that it is subject to significant business risks related to its customers and suppliers year efforts  although if the company s customer or vendors experience year problems  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the effect of year interruptions on the company and our customer s operations is difficult to predict because flexible staffing could be a vehicle that the company s customer s may use to correct the effect of year disruptions in their business 
the company will continue to monitor the status of its customers and key strategic partners as a means of determining risks and alternatives 
the company is also in the process of developing contingency plans with regards to the high risk areas described above as well as areas of medium risk have been determined to not have the impact of disruption to the business 
the company estimates that the total cost of the project will be approximately million which includes both personnel costs related to project management  programming  and hardware and software upgrades 
of this total  approximately million has been incurred as of december  the cost of the project and the estimated completion dates are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove accurate  and actual results could differ from those estimated if these assumptions prove inaccurate 
the year discussion includes forward looking statements  therefore there can be no assurance that the company will not experience year problems 
however  based upon the progress to date  the company believes that it is unlikely that the actual results will differ significantly from those estimated and that the year compliance will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition
