item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview since the company was incorporated in  its strategy has been to market high quality contact lenses to eyecare practitioners at competitive prices using a low cost to serve operating structure 
until  the company was principally a distributor of contact lenses 
in september  the company became an integrated contact lens company by acquiring the primary supplier of its lenses  precision lens laboratories ltd 
pll  a united kingdom based company now called ocular sciences ltd 
osl 
in october  the company acquired the north and south american contact lens business of allergan  inc allergan  which had been operating under the name american hydron 
this acquisition provided the company with a significantly expanded customer base  an additional line of contact lens products to a manufacturing facility in puerto rico 
the purchase price was million  including acquisition costs of million 
the american hydron acquisition resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets of million  all of which were fully amortized by the end of prior to the summer of  the company derived a substantial majority of its sales from lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens and the remainder of its sales from lenses marketed for monthly replacement regimens 
in the third quarter of  the company began selling lenses marketed for weekly disposable replacement regimens 
since that time  substantially all of the company s growth in net sales has resulted from sales of lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens  primarily weekly disposable replacement regimens 
the company s lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens historically have had lower selling prices and gross margins and are sold in much greater volumes than its lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens 
in  lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens accounted for of the company s unit volume and of net sales 
see business risk factors 
in  approximately of the company s us net sales came from sales to optometrists  ophthalmologists  and the distributors that sell to such practitioners  and approximately of the company s us net sales came from sales to chain stores and mass merchants 
results of operations all results of operations data in the following tables is presented in thousands 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales years ended december  change us   international   net sales   as a percentage of net sales us international net sales represents gross sales less allowances for returns  trial set and prompt payment discounts 
the company recognizes sales upon shipment of products to its customers 
discounts and allowances for sales returns are accrued at the time sales are recognized 
net sales increased to million in from million in this growth resulted from increased sales of the company s lenses marketed for weekly disposable replacement regimens in both the us and international markets 
unit sales of the company s lenses marketed for weekly disposable replacement regimens increased from to international sales revenue growth continued to be strong  with revenue growth of and unit growth of from to in  of all lenses sold by the company were marketed for use in disposable replacement regimens  compared to in the company s overall average selling price declined approximately from to  primarily as a result of a continued shift in product mix towards sales of lower priced products for weekly disposable replacement regimens  price reductions on the weekly disposable products in the us  and geographic mix towards lower priced international distributors 
the price reductions on the company s lenses marketed for weekly replacement took place during the second half of in response to price changes by the company s largest competitor  and were offset in part by reductions in cooperative merchandising allowances described in selling and marketing expenses  below 
the company expects that the overall average selling price that it realizes across its products will continue to decline over time  and may decline at a greater rate than in the past  because of i shifts in the company s product mix from lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens to lenses marketed for weekly and daily disposable replacement regimens  ii further decreases in the average per unit selling prices of lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens  and iii increases in products sold internationally to distributors at prices lower than direct sales prices in the united states 
the company does not expect there to be any growth in its sales of lenses for annual replacement as a result of the continuing shift in consumer demand towards more frequent replacement regimens 
the company has recently introduced a low priced lens to be marketed for daily replacement in japan  expects to introduce a lens marketed for daily replacement in europe later in and is evaluating the introduction of such a lens in the united states 
the company expects that introduction of the new lenses marketed for daily disposal will result in increased unit and revenue growth due to the more frequent replacement of such lenses 
historically  the company s first quarter net sales have been lower than its fourth quarter net sales  and the company expects that its net sales for the quarter ending march  will be lower than its net sales for the quarter ended december  gross profit years ended december  change gross profit   as a percentage of net sales cost of sales is comprised primarily of the labor  overhead and material costs of production and packaging  freight and duty  inventory reserves  royalties to third parties and amortization of certain intangible assets 
a substantial portion of the company s cost of sales is fixed and therefore declines as a percentage of net sales as volume increases 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales  in the increase in gross profit from to was due primarily to increased net sales  and to decreases in per unit production costs resulting from the implementation of certain process improvements and increases in manufacturing volume 
the company expects cost reductions resulting from improvements in the company s current production process to be less significant in the future 
the company intends to add new  automated production technology at its united kingdom and puerto rico facilities  and is currently validating the first of these automated production lines  and anticipates commencing production on these new lines in the first half of the new manufacturing technology is designed to further reduce the company s per unit cost of production over time  although such cost reductions may not be seen until future periods and are dependent in part on increases in production volume to offset the higher depreciation costs which are a component of cost of goods sold associated with the new production lines 
in addition  as described above in net sales  the company expects that its overall average selling price on its current products will continue to decline over time  and that accordingly  the company will need to continue to reduce its per unit production costs through increased automation  increased volume and reduced packaging costs in order to improve  or even maintain  its gross margins on such products 
see factors that may affect future results manufacturing capacity constraints  risks associated with expansion and automation of manufacturing operations 
the company expects that the introduction of a lower priced lens marketed for the daily disposable replacement regimen will result in a decline in the average selling price of the company s products  while reductions in costs of sales will likely not reach comparable levels until subsequent periods  if at all 
accordingly  the company expects its gross margins to decrease  at least in the first several quarters following the introduction of lenses marketed for daily replacement regimens and also expects that gross margins may fluctuate more significantly than in the past 
see factors that may affect future results fluctuations in operating results  decreasing average sales prices 
in the fourth quarter of  the company finalized plans to change the packaging component of its manufacturing process in late  resulting in an  write down in of certain of its manufacturing assets to estimated fair value and a corresponding  increase in cost of sales 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling and marketing expenses years ended december  change selling and marketing expenses   as a percentage of net sales selling and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of cooperative merchandising allowances  sample diagnostic products provided to eyecare practitioners without charge  salaries  commissions and benefits for selling and marketing personnel and postage and freight charges not billed to customers 
cooperative merchandising allowances are reimbursements made principally to chain stores and mass merchants for items such as advertising  displays and mailings that are intended to encourage the fitting and wearing of the company s lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens 
these allowances are limited to a percentage of purchases of lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens from the company 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million  or to of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the increase  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales from to resulted primarily from an increase in cooperative merchandising allowances  increases in the size of the us sales force and increases in royalties which are due on certain uk sales 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in cooperative merchandising allowances was primarily attributable to the unit growth in lenses marketed for weekly disposable replacement regimens as well as the growth in sales to the optical retail channel which tends to carry a higher level of these allowances 
in connection with the price reductions discussed in net sales  the company realized a reduction of its cooperative merchandising allowances of in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of the company expects that for the next four quarters  the rate of growth in cooperative merchandising allowances will slow  and as a result expects that the rate of growth of sales and marketing expenses  will also slow 
however  if the company is required to respond to pricing and promotional pressures from competitors  its rate of spending on cooperative merchandising allowances could increase in the future 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  change general and administrative expenses   as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and benefits for general and administrative  distribution  non manufacturing facilities costs  professional services  and consultants fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  but declined as a percentage of net sales from to 
included in the expense  is a charge of  related to a custom built packaging machine which failed factory acceptance tests and company specifications 
the company did not take delivery of this custom built machine nor used it in its production 
this amount represented cumulative payments to the vendor  which had been recorded in construction in progress and subsequently charged to general and administrative expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
without this one time expense  general and administrative expenses would have increased from to the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to the additional infrastructure related to the requirements of being a publicly held company  partially offset by provisions for sales and use taxes recorded in the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from expenses growing at a slower rate than revenues  automation of the company s distribution centers and the leverage from utilizing the infrastructures of the company s international partners rather than establishing direct operations overseas 
for example  worldwide unit sales increased from to while worldwide distribution expenses increased only during this period 
the company believes that as net sales grow  its general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of net sales 
research and development expenses years ended december  change research and development expenses   as a percentage of net sales research and development expenses are comprised primarily of consulting costs for research and development and in house engineering and process development labor related to the company s ongoing focus on reducing per unit costs of production 
the decrease from to  both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue  was primarily due to the fact that the company completed the research and development phase related to its new automated production technology during the third quarter of and commenced installation and validation of equipment utilizing this technology 
installation and validation expenditures are capitalized rather than expensed 
the company expects its research and development expenses to increase  both in absolute amount and as a percentage of net sales in research and development expenses may fluctuate as the company undertakes new engineering projects and new products 
interest and other income expenses  net years ended december  change interest and other income expenses  net  as a percentage of net sales interest and other income expenses  net increased to million  or to of net sales  in from an expense of  or of net sales  in this increase primarily resulted from a reduction in interest expense as the aggregate amount of the company s borrowings was reduced following its initial public offering in august and an increase in interest earned as a result of the investment of a portion of the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
income taxes years ended december  change income taxes   effective tax rate income taxes were million in and million in the company s effective tax rate decreased from in to in as a result of an increase in the earnings from the company s puerto rican operations  which are partially exempt from us taxation 
the company anticipates that it will continue to benefit from the favorable effect of this partial exemption through  with limited exemption during the transition period from through  when the benefit will expire under the current provisions of the internal revenue code 
the company has implemented a new corporate structure that is likely to result in an increase in its foreign earnings 
as a result  the company believes that its effective tax rate will decrease  so long as the company maintains its policy of reinvesting its foreign earnings overseas 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales years ended december  change us   international   net sales   as a percentage of net sales us international net sales increased to million in from million in substantially all of this growth resulted from increased sales of the company s lenses marketed for weekly disposable replacement regimens 
the company s international sales as a percentage of total sales increased from in to in primarily as a result of increased demand experienced by the company s international distributors and new partnering and distributor relationships established by the company abroad 
in  of all lenses sold by the company were marketed for use in disposable replacement regimens  compared to in the company s overall average selling price declined approximately from to  primarily as a result of a shift in product mix from lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens to lower priced lenses marketed for disposable replacement and  to a lesser extent  as a result of an increase in the percentage of the company s products sold internationally to distributors at prices lower than direct sales prices in the united states 
within each principal distribution channel  the average selling price of each of the company s primary products remained relatively stable from to gross profit years ended december  change gross profit   as a percentage of net sales gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales  in the increase in gross profit from to was due primarily to increased net sales  and to decreases in per unit production costs resulting from the implementation of certain process improvements and increases in manufacturing volume

see business risk factors manufacturing capacity constraints  risks associated with expansion and automation of manufacturing operations 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents  borrowings available under its credit facilities and its anticipated net cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital  contractual commitments and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if cash generated from operations proves insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain further credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
the sale of additional debt or further bank borrowings could subject the company to additional restrictive financial covenants and restrictions on the payment of dividends 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available to the company in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
euro conversion on january   eleven european union member countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legal currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the euro is currently traded on currency exchanges and can be used in business transactions 
the company does not anticipate any material impact from the euro conversion on its financial information systems nor its financial condition and results of operations 
year many currently installed computer systems and software products are unable to distinguish between twentieth century dates and twenty first century dates because such systems may have been developed using two digits rather than four to determine the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this error could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such year requirements 
the company s business is dependent on the operation of numerous systems that could potentially be impacted by year related problems 
those systems include  among others hardware and software systems used by the company to manufacture and deliver products and services to its customers  the internal systems of the company s customers and suppliers  the hardware and software systems used internally by the company in the management of its business  and non information technology systems and services used by the company in the management of its business  such as telephone systems and building systems 
in early  the company s board of directors named it s chief information officer cio to head up a compliance project to identify all information technology it  non it systems and third party related issues 
the cio or other appropriate person will make presentations on the company s compliance program at each board of directors meeting until the year at present  the company has completed an inventory of all it and non it systems and has assessed the requirements for modifications 
the company believes that correction and testing will be completed by the third quarter of and implementation by october to date  the company s expenditures to review and remedy year compliance problems have not been material  and the company does not expect such expenditures to be material in the future 
the company is also in the process of replacing its business control information systems with new systems that function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company has implemented several of these applications and anticipates implementing the other planned applications by the middle of the company expects that  with the new information system  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer system  however  there can be no assurance there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the new information system and the company s inability to install such a system could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
if this project is delayed  the company believes that it can modify its current systems at a cost of approximately  to handle year dates 
the company has developed contingency plans to address and mitigate potential year problems that may arise 
as part of the company s contingency plans  the company is developing specific plans for each critical system to allow for interrupted operations to resume in a timely manner 
however  contingency planning for year issues is complicated due to the possibility of multiple and simultaneous incidents  some of which may be outside of the company s control  for example  noncompliance of third party systems 
there can be no assurances that if these scenarios do occur  the company will be able to respond in a timely manner and resume normal business 
the company has not fully determined the extent to which it may be impacted by third parties systems  which may not be year compliant 
the year computer issue creates risk for the company from third parties with whom the company works on business transactions worldwide 
given the company s significant operations in the united kingdom and puerto rico  the company may be especially susceptible to year problems of third parties in those regions  as well as in the united states 
while the company has begun efforts to seek reassurance from its suppliers and service providers  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies that the company works with or on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that any such failure to convert by another company could not have an adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its internal operating systems will be year compliant before december  therefore  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario will be that one or more of third parties with which the company has a material business relationship will not have successfully dealt with its year issues 
a critical third party failure such as telecommunication  utilities or financial institutions could have a material adverse affect on the company by adversely affecting the company s ability to manufacture and distribute its products  order and pay for production materials from suppliers and receive orders and payments from customers 
additionally  year problems at customers may result in reduced purchasing by such customers 
it is also possible that one or more of the company s internal operating systems will not function properly and make it difficult to complete routine tasks  such as accounting and other record keeping duties 
based on information currently available  the company does not believe that it will experience any long term operating systems failures 
however  there can be no assurance of this  and the company intends to continue to monitor these issues as part of its year project and to concentrate its efforts on minimizing their impact 
the foregoing discussion of the company s year readiness includes forward looking statements  including estimates of the time frames and costs for addressing the known year issues confronting the company  and is based on management s current estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual events and results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of personnel with required remediation skills  the ability of the company to identify and correct or replace all relevant computer code and other systems affected by the year problem  and the success of third parties with whom the company does business in addressing their year issues
