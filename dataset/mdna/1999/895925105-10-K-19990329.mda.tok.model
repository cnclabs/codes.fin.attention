the increase in the loss ratio in the fourth quarter of reflects an increase in delinquent loans reported in the latter half of as well as reduced earned premiums due to lower persistency 
due to the inherent uncertainty of future premium levels  losses  economic conditions  and other factors that impact earnings  it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty the impact of such higher claims frequencies on future earnings

the parent company retained the balance of the net proceeds of the offering  approximately million  and these proceeds are available for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  investment  payments of principal and interest on the notes  and possible future contributions to its subsidiaries

the company s long term debt bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and as a result  the fair value of this debt is sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates 
a relative increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect the company s financial instruments would not have a material impact on earnings during the next fiscal year  and would not materially affect the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
the company s loss reserves increased to million at december   compared to million at december  this growth is the result of the increases in new insurance written and the maturing of the company s risk in force
