overview we collect  process  recover and dispose of liquid waste through a number of subsidiaries that are organized into two divisions 
the wastewater division collects  processes and disposes of liquid waste and recovers saleable by products from certain waste streams 
we formed our wastewater division when we acquired two companies in june in transactions that were accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
the oilfield waste division processes and disposes of waste generated in oil and gas exploration and production 
it was formed in december when we purchased five of our louisiana and texas landfarms from certain subsidiaries of waste management  inc from january  through march   we acquired six additional businesses which collectively had approximately million of revenues during our cost for these acquisitions was approximately million in cash and debt  and  shares of common stock 
the results of operations of these six business are not included in the results of operations presented in this report 
the wastewater division generated million  or  of our revenues for the year ended december  this division derives revenues from two principal sources fees received for collecting and processing liquid waste such as industrial wastewater  grease and grit trap waste  bulk liquids and dated beverages  and certain hazardous wastes  and revenue obtained from the sale of by products  including fats  oils  feed proteins  industrial and fuel grade ethanol  solvents  aluminum  glass  plastic and cardboard  recovered from waste streams 
as a result of an acquisition that we completed in april  our by product sales include revenues from the brokering of industrial and fuel grade ethanol produced by third parties 
in the second quarter of  we began curtailing these brokerage activities except where necessary to meet our customers volume and quality requirements 
collection and processing fees charged to customers vary per gallon by waste stream according to the constituents of the waste  expenses associated with processing the waste and competitive factors 
by products are commodities and their prices fluctuate based on market conditions 
we anticipate that revenues from collection and processing fees  which have higher margins than by product sales  will increase at a faster rate than revenues from sales of by products 
we anticipate that the wastewater division will represent a growing share of our business because of its projected internal growth and future acquisitions 
the oilfield waste division generated million  or  of our revenues for the year ended december  this division derives revenues from fees charged to customers for i processing and disposing of oil and gas exploration and production waste  and ii cleaning tanks  barges and other vessels and containers used in the storage and transportation of oilfield waste 
the fees charged for processing and disposing of oilfield waste are based on the composition of the waste and vary significantly 
accordingly  we believe that total revenues are a better indicator of performance than is the average fee charged 
in order to match revenues with their related costs  when waste is unloaded at one of our sites  we recognize the related revenue and record a reserve for the estimated amount of expenses to be incurred to process and dispose of the waste 
as processing occurs  generally over nine to twelve months  the reserve is depleted as expenses are incurred 
our operating margins in the oilfield waste division are typically higher than in the wastewater division 
newpark resources  inc is the largest customer of the oilfield waste division 
as described in business operations and services provided oilfield waste division  in september  we entered into a new month agreement with newpark 
in this agreement  newpark agreed to pay us at least million 
newpark paid us million in september and an additional million between october  and march  the remaining amounts are required to be paid to us in monthly installments continuing through june these payments will permit newpark to deliver to us at no additional cost specified amounts of oilfield waste for processing and disposal 
operating expenses include compensation and overhead related to operations workers  supplies and other raw materials  transportation charges  disposal fees paid to third parties  real estate lease payments and energy and insurance costs applicable to waste processing and disposal operations 
depreciation and amortization expenses relate to our landfarms and other depreciable or amortizable assets 
landfarms  which constitute approximately of our net property  plant and equipment  are amortized over years 
other depreciable or amortizable assets are amortized over periods ranging from three to years 
amortization expenses relating to acquisitions have increased over time as a result of amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead relating to our corporate offices and each of our operating sites  as well as professional services and costs 
in the discussion of our results of operations  selling  general and administrative expenses also include  of non recurring pooling costs associated with two acquisitions 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the wastewater division contributed million  or  of revenues and million  or  of revenues 
wastewater division revenues can be further broken down into two categories i collection and processing fees  and ii by product sales 
collection and processing fees generated million  or  and million  or  of the wastewater division s revenues for and  respectively 
revenues from collection and processing of waste increased million due to acquisitions completed during and the fourth quarter of  as well as increased pricing 
by product sales generated the remaining million  or  and million  or  of the wastewater division s revenues for and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of by products increased million  or  as a result of acquisitions completed in and the fourth quarter of however  sales of fats  oils and feed proteins decreased million  or  from to due to a reduction in commodities prices 
the oilfield waste division contributed million  or  of revenues and million  or  of revenues 
the oilfield waste division s revenues decreased million  or  due to a decline in drilling activity in the gulf coast region 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses increased from in to in this increase was due primarily to our transition from operating primarily as an oilfield waste disposal company into an integrated liquid waste management company providing collection  processing  recovery and disposal services 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased from in to in this decrease was also attributable primarily to our transition from operating primarily as an oilfield waste disposal company into a less capital intensive integrated liquid waste management company 
in addition  a large percentage of our capital expenditures were incurred in the last quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in this improvement resulted primarily from our ability to integrate business acquisitions without a proportionate increase in general and administrative expenses 
interest and other expenses 
net interest and other expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from interest expense incurred on borrowings used to fund the purchase price for acquisitions completed in income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased million  or  from million in to million in as a result of increased taxable income 
the effective tax rate for was  compared to a rate for years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  collection and processing fees generated million  or  and million  or  of the wastewater division s revenues for and  respectively 
revenues from collection and processing of waste increased million  or  due primarily to an increase in the volume of waste processed 
by product sales generated million  or  and million  or  of the wastewater division s revenues for and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of by products increased million  or  due primarily to an increase in sales of fats  oils and feed proteins 
the oilfield waste division contributed  or  of revenues and million  or  of revenues 
the oilfield waste division s revenues increased million as a result of the inclusion of the oilfield waste division for all of as compared to less than one month in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to the inclusion of the oilfield waste division for all of as compared to less than one month in as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses decreased from for to for this improvement reflects higher operating margins derived by the oilfield waste division as opposed to the wastewater division 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  from  in to million in as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses increased from in to in the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of the oilfield waste division 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the majority of this increase related to the inclusion of the oilfield waste division for all of as compared to less than one month in selling  general and administrative expenses increased from of revenues to of revenues  primarily due to higher personnel costs and professional fees associated with being a public company and establishing our corporate offices in houston in may interest and other expenses 
net interest and other expenses increased million  or  from  in to million in net interest and other expenses increased primarily as a result of interest expense related to debt incurred in acquiring the oilfield waste division in and other businesses in income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased million  or  from  in to million in this increase resulted primarily from additional taxable income 
the effective tax rate for was of income and the effective tax rate for was of income 
liquidity and capital resources we had net working capital of million at december   compared to net working capital of million at december  our capital requirements for continuing operations consist of our general working capital needs  scheduled principal payments on our debt obligations and capital leases  and planned capital expenditures 
at december   approximately million of principal payments on debt obligations were payable during the next twelve months 
capital expenditures for are budgeted at million 
approximately million of this amount is budgeted to be invested in the wastewater division for plant expansions  equipment and vehicle upgrades 
the remaining amounts are budgeted to be invested in the oilfield waste division for equipment 
at december   we had established a million reserve to provide for the cost of future closures of facilities 
the amount of this unfunded reserve is based on the estimated total cost to close the facilities as calculated in accordance with the applicable regulations 
regulatory agencies require us to post financial assurance to assure that all waste will be treated and the facilities closed appropriately 
we have in place a total of million of financial assurance in the form of letters of credit and bonds 
we have a million credit facility with a group of banks under which we may borrow to fund working capital requirements and acquisitions 
the amount of this credit facility was increased in february from million to million 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility are secured by a lien on all or substantially all of our assets 
the credit facility prohibits the payment of dividends and requires us to comply with certain financial covenants 
the credit facility also places certain restrictions on  among other things  acquisitions and other business combination transactions which we may consummate 
we do not believe that these restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill our current acquisition program 
the debt outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated by the lenders if  among other things  a change in control of the company occurs or michael p 
lawlor  w 
gregory orr or earl j 
blackwell ceases to serve as an executive officer of the company and is not replaced within days by an individual reasonably satisfactory to the lenders 
at december   we had borrowed approximately million under the credit facility 
advances under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at the prime rate or london interbank offered rate  in each case  plus a margin which is calculated quarterly based upon our ratio of indebtedness to cash flow 
as of december   amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accruing interest at approximately per year 
we also have a million credit facility with bankboston  na under which we may borrow to purchase equipment 
no amounts were outstanding under this equipment credit facility as of december  our capital resources consist of cash reserves  cash generated from operations and funds available under our million credit facility and the equipment credit facility 
we expect that these resources will be sufficient to fund continuing operations for at least the next twelve months 
in addition to capital required for our ongoing operations  we will require additional capital to pursue our long term acquisition program 
we anticipate that future acquisitions will be made using a combination of common stock and cash 
we currently have  shares of common stock available for issuance under our acquisition shelf registration statement and we intend to register an additional  shares of common stock under the securities act of for use in future acquisitions 
most of the cash to be used in future acquisitions is expected to be derived from borrowings under our million credit facility 
in addition  we may seek to raise additional equity capital for all or a substantial part of the consideration to be paid for future acquisitions or to reduce our debt 
in certain of our acquisitions  we agreed to pay additional consideration to the owners of the acquired business if the future pre tax earnings of the acquired business exceed certain negotiated levels or other specified events occur 
to the extent that any contingent consideration is required to be paid in connection with an acquisition  we anticipate that the cash flows of the acquired business will be sufficient to pay the contingent consideration 
year compliance many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  such computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year we are currently identifying which of our information technology and non information technology systems will be affected by year issues 
our year compliance program consists of three phases identification and assessment  remediation  and testing 
for any given system  the phases occur in sequential order  from identification and assessment of year problems  to remediation and  finally  to testing our solutions 
however  as we acquire additional businesses  each information technology and non information technology system of the acquired business must be independently identified and assessed 
as a result  all three phases of our year compliance program may occur simultaneously as they relate to different systems 
each phase may have a varying timetable to completion  depending upon the system and the date when a particular business was acquired by us 
we have completed the identification and assessment of most of our information technology systems  and those systems address or have been modified to address year problems 
we will continue to assess the information technology systems of businesses that we have recently acquired and that we may acquire in the future 
we are in the identification and assessment phase with respect to non information technology systems of currently owned businesses 
we anticipate completing all phases of our year compliance program by june   with the possible exception of the remediation and testing phases for certain of our non information technology systems 
we cannot assure you  however  that recently acquired businesses will be year compliant 
however  to the extent feasible  we review the year status of acquisition candidates before we complete an acquisition 
our costs to date for our year compliance program have not been material 
although we have not completed our assessment of non information technology systems  we do not currently believe that the future costs associated with our year compliance program will be material 
we are currently unable to determine our most reasonably likely worst case year scenario  because we have not identified and assessed all of our non information technology systems 
because most of our information technology systems address or have been modified to address year problems and because most of our businesses do not employ a high degree of process or plant automation  we do not anticipate that the year will have a significant impact on our operations 
however  a failure to address all of our year issues successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
this is a year readiness disclosure statement within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act pl 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and we do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our obligations under our million credit facility and our million equipment credit facility 
as of december   million and had been borrowed under the million credit facility and the equipment credit facility  respectively 
as of december   amounts outstanding under the million credit facility were accruing interest at approximately per year
