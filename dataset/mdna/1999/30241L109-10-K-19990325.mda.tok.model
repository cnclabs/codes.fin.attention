item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development costs selling  general and administrative costs amortization of intangibles purchased in process research and development restructuring and reorganization costs operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before taxes tax expense benefit net loss net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased million compared to the corresponding period in the increase in sales for the period was affected by the fact that the period includes net sales of the combined company  while the period includes net sales of the peo operations only through february  and net sales of the combined company thereafter 
net sales for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  the increase in sales is primarily attributable to the fact that the period includes net sales of the combined company from the date of the peo combination  and the period includes net sales of the peo operations only 
segment net sales for reflect increases of and  respectively  for each of the components and microelectronic segments while the electron optics segment sales were essentially unchanged from levels 
when compared with sales  electron optics segment sales were higher in industry conditions in both the semiconductor manufacturing sector and the data storage sector were generally weak during but showed some improvement in both the third and fourth calendar quarters 
these industry sectors represent the principal markets for the company s components and microelectronics segments 
the microelectronics segment reported sales were reduced by fluctuations in the foreign currency translation rates as the us dollar strengthened in against the principal european currencies in which the company transacts its business 
in as compared with these fluctuations had an approximately negative effect on net sales 
foreign currency translation rate fluctuations in asia pacific region  which represented  and of total sales for  and respectively  had the effect of increasing reported asia pacific sales by 
approximately of the company s asia pacific sales were denominated in local asia pacific currencies 
for as compared to unit volume in the microelectronic products segment increased slightly more than as did average selling price 
year over year pricing volatility as measured by discount from suggested list price was slightly improved 
for electron optics products  unit volume and unit pricing were essentially stable 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased million compared to  and for the year ended december   gross profit increased million compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales was  and for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  the company recognized charges totaling million in cost of sales for inventory write offs  obsolescence reserves  reserves for product upgrades  and increased warranty reserves 
excluding the effect of these charges  the gross profit as a percentage of sales would have been for the year ended december  in addition  the write up of pre peo combination fei s inventory from cost to fair market value and the resulting increase in cost of goods sold had a negative impact on gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  this write up of pre peo combination fei s assets was a result of the reverse acquisition accounting applied to the peo combination 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in compared to is primarily due to a change in product mix and a lower percentage of total sales attributed to the service business 
research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended december  increased million compared to and increased million for the year ended december  compared to as a percentage of sales  research and development costs were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expense reflects increased efforts to develop certain technologies for new products 
expenditures for these efforts represented million of the increase 
the expense includes the write off of million of previously capitalized software development costs in the first quarter 
the costs included pre peo combination fei from the merger date forward  while the research and development costs were for peo operations only 
selling  general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  increased million compared to  and increased million for the year ended december  compared to as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative costs were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs for was primarily attributable to increased salary and related personnel costs of million 
a portion of the increase stems from the comparison of the twelve month period of the combined company with approximately ten months for the combined company in the period 
the first quarter of also included million in bad debt expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs in compared to resulted primarily from the higher costs incurred in when the combined company was a separate publicly reporting entity compared to those for peo operations as a business within philips 
amortization of intangibles 
purchase accounting for the peo combination as of february  resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million for existing technology that is being amortized over a year period  and goodwill of million that is being amortized over a year period 
amortization of intangibles for increased million compared to this increase reflects amortization of the intangibles resulting from the peo combination for the entire year in as compared to amortization only from february  the date of the peo combination  in purchased in process research and development 
purchase accounting for the peo combination as of february   resulted in the recognition of an intangible asset in the amount of million representing the estimated fair value of in process research and development of pre peo combination fei 
the intangible asset was written off with a charge to earnings immediately following the peo combination in keeping with the company s policy to expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
in connection with the purchase accounting for the peo combination  the company identified four significant projects under development 
the development of three of those four projects was completed in and  with revenue recognized in late and the fourth project is still under development 
it is expected to generate revenue in while the semiconductor manufacturing sector and the data storage sector were generally weak during  the company s long term expectations for those markets and  accordingly  for these projects  have not changed significantly

restructuring and reorganization costs 
on july  the company announced a restructuring and reorganization program to consolidate operations  eliminate redundant facilities  reduce operating expenses  and provide for outsourcing of certain manufacturing activities 
as announced  the program is intended to eliminate approximately positions worldwide  or about of its work force as of july  the charge of million recognized in the year ended december  primarily represents the cost of providing severance  outplacement assistance  and associated benefits to affected employees 
of this charge  million remains as a liability at december  this liability will be discharged in as the company s outsourcing plan continues to be implemented 
additional charges totaling million are expected to be recorded as they are incurred through june for transitional costs of consolidating operations and outsourcing certain activities 
in march  the company transferred its electroscan manufacturing activities to its manufacturing facility in eindhoven  the netherlands  and abandoned the majority of the technology acquired 
consequently  a charge to earnings of million was recognized 
the charge included million of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of the assets of electroscan  along with estimated severance costs for electroscan employees and other related costs 
the following table summarizes the december  status of the restructuring and reorganization costs 
restructuring and reorganization costs charged to expense electroscan operation  worldwide restructuring  less settled amounts  less non cash write downs  remaining cash requirements at  other income expense  net 
interest income for the years ended december  and represents interest earned on the investment of excess cash 
interest expense for the same periods represents interest incurred on borrowings under the company s bank line of credit facilities and on borrowings from philips 
prior to the date of the peo combination  the peo operations participated in philips centralized cash management program and did not earn interest income or incur interest expense 
in september  management reduced to zero the carrying value of its cost method investment in norsam technologies  inc norsam and  accordingly  recorded a million valuation adjustment 
management revised its projections for future cash flows that it expected to receive from its investment in norsam following norsam s divestiture of certain assets 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the company s tax rates differ from the us federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of state and foreign taxes  the amortization of intangible assets not deductible for income tax purposes  and the favorable tax effect of the company s use of a foreign sales corporation for exports from the us the company did not recognize a tax benefit for the year ended december   primarily because the million of purchased in process research and development cost written off immediately subsequent to the peo combination was non deductible for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  and zero at december  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   and cash used by operating activities of million for the year ended december  cash flows from operating activities before the effect of working capital changes decreased from million in to a deficit of for this decrease  coupled with a significant use of cash million to fund receivables of the company s expanded operations following the peo combination in  led the company to reconfigure its working capital structure 
a substantial portion of its account balance with affiliates of koninklijke philips electronics nv philips was reclassified to a long term account in anticipation of its repayment from the company s new credit facility 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information 
investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december   million during the year ended december   and million during the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to acquisitions of equipment and investment in software development 
in  the peo operations used million to acquire the assets of electroscan corporation and the peo operations in brno  czech republic 
the company expects to continue to invest in plant and equipment and technology needed for future business requirements  as well as to invest in internally developed software for its products 
financing activities provided cash of million for  million for  and million for the financing activities are comprised of cash uses for net repayments under the company s bank line of credit in the amount of million  offset by a million net long term borrowing from philips previously reflected in current account with philips 
the amount included million of cash contributed to the peo operations as part of the peo combination 
during the third calendar quarter of  the company violated a financial ratio covenant in its line of credit agreement and obtained a waiver of the covenant 
in february the company negotiated a new credit agreement  and obtained commitment on a three year million revolving credit facility from philips 
the facility allows the company  subject to certain financial covenants  to borrow in multiple currencies for its general corporate needs  excluding acquisitions 
borrowings under the agreement will bear interest at a variable libor rate from to days  at the company s designation  plus a incremental rate 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
with this new million revolving line of credit  the company refinanced and replaced its million revolving line of credit with a us bank 
in december  the company announced that it had entered into a merger agreement with micrion corporation of peabody  massachusetts 
subject to shareholder and regulatory approval  the company expects that it will consummate the merger transaction in for consideration of in cash and one share of the company s common stock for each micrion common share outstanding 
under certain conditions this consideration could be reduced in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement 
financing requirements for the transaction are expected to be approximately million  including the cash consideration and estimated transaction costs as well as the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock to micrion shareholders 
the company has entered into a stock purchase agreement with its majority shareholder  philips business electronics  to finance its cash requirements for the merger 
the company expects to sell approximately million common shares to philips business electronics at an expected per share price of 
proceeds from this sale of shares in excess of the cash consideration to micrion shareholders and transaction costs will be used to repay micrion bank debt 
the company is evaluating service and distribution businesses in international locations 
these businesses are currently operating under a distribution agreement between the company and a philips affiliate 
the agreement was entered into in february and had an initial term which ends on january   unless extended 
the company is evaluating purchasing some of these businesses or obtaining alternate distributors in some locations 
depending on a number of variables  some of which have not been quantified  the company may make additional investment in its service and distribution network 
the company s global sales activities and related service and support activities result in complex foreign currency exposures 
the company does not have a formal hedging program in place  however  it does enter into forward contracts to sell or purchase foreign currencies to hedge specific sales transactions 
it has been more active in hedging foreign currency sales of electron optics products against the dutch guilder than it has been in hedging microelectronic and component product sales  which are predominantly dollar denominated 
as of december   the company had forward purchase and sale contracts of foreign currency totaling million  which if settled at the spot exchange rate at december  would have resulted in a loss of million 
the february credit agreement allows the company to borrow funds in multiple currencies 
the company expects to use this capability to better align its currency exposures  particularly with respect to the japanese yen 
financing these working capital requirements  particularly those  for accounts receivable and inventory  with local currency borrowings  will reduce the company s need to hedge multiple  individual sales transactions 
the introduction of the euro also provides the company with an opportunity to reduce its exposure to the foreign currency translation fluctuations of the various european monetary union countries in which it reports results by adopting the euro as its reporting currency for those operations 
these countries include france  germany  italy and the netherlands 
the company is evaluating its timetable for adoption of euro reporting and will not be fully converted to euro reporting for the full calendar the company s automated transaction and reporting systems are capable of reporting in either local currency or euros without extensive modification 
an important consideration in adopting euro reporting will be the adoption patterns of the company s customers and vendors in the european monetary union 
in conjunction with sales growth from to the company s working capital requirements increased primarily due to an increased amount in accounts receivable 
during inventory levels increased  despite valuation adjustments  but were consistent with the stronger sales performance during the second half of the year 
the company s working capital is subject to fluctuation due to the timing of its shipments 
since the company s products typically have a large sales value per unit  the timing of specific units in a reporting period can affect the relative levels of inventory and accounts receivable without a corresponding change in liabilities 
the company s restructuring and reorganization programs also affected working capital as reflected previously 
the remaining restructuring and reorganization charges  which will be settled in  total million 
in each of the past three years  the company has reported a net loss 
the net losses in and in have stemmed from charges related to the write off of purchased in process research and development costs  restructuring charges and material valuation adjustments to certain of its inventories and investments 
because many of these charges did not require cash outlays in the reporting period  the company s liquidity has not been impaired 
in addition to internally generating cash flows from its existing business  the company has obtained financing and contingent financing from philips affiliates  as evidenced by the pending stock purchase agreement as well as the new revolving credit agreement 
the company believes it also has access to other sources of equity and debt capital from unrelated parties 
the company explored its financing options and evaluated competitive arrangements before entering into these arrangements with philips affiliates 
the company expects to make continued investments in tangible and intangible assets as previously described 
it believes that cash flows from these investments and from growth of its existing businesses will provide adequate liquidity 
due to the company s commitment to an aggressive investment program  it does not pay and does not plan to pay  in the foreseeable future  a dividend on its common stock 
backlog the company s backlog consists of purchase orders it has received for products it expects to ship within the next months 
the company s backlog at december  was approximately million 
a substantial portion of the company s backlog relates to orders for a relatively small number of products 
as a result  the timing of the receipt of orders could have a significant impact on the company s backlog at any date 
for this and other reasons  the amount of backlog at any date is not necessarily determinative of revenue in future periods 
year disclosure state of readiness 
in january  the company formed a year team composed of representatives of various aspects of the company s operations that may be significantly affected by year readiness issues  including hardware and software related to the company s manufacturing control  accounting and other information technology systems  product software and hardware  supplier products and post sales support 
the year team developed a multi part plan to measure and address the company s year readiness  consisting of i product testing using test criteria developed by sematech  a semiconductor industry trade association  ii testing hardware and software of the company s manufacturing control  accounting and other information technology systems and addressing deficiencies  iii identification and assessment of other third suppliers products raising year compliance issues and making direct inquiry to such vendors concerning their state of readiness and resolving issues  iv communications with the customer base concerning year readiness of the company s products  and v evaluate the need for and as appropriate  develop a contingency plan 
the company has analyzed and partially tested its internal manufacturing control  accounting and other information technology systems and determined that  to the extent tested  those systems have no material year compliance deficiencies 
internal systems tests are to be completed by the second quarter of in its analysis  the company has assumed that basic public utilities such as gas  electric and telephone services will continue to be available for operations of the company on and after january  in the us  the netherlands and the czech republic 
if this assumption proves incorrect  the operations of the affected manufacturing location would be materially adversely affected for the duration of the utility interruption 
the company has completed the testing of its products and has communicated with customers concerning year readiness of these products and third party products incorporated into systems sold by the company 
the company anticipates undertaking additional communications with its customers prior to the end of the second quarter of the company will complete by the end of the second quarter of  instructions to post sale field service representatives on year readiness of products that are under service contracts 
based on communications to date  the company has not received notice of or become aware of a material year deficiency by a supplier 
however  the company has not yet completed its inquiry of all suppliers and further communications may identify year deficiencies 
costs 
at this time  the company believes costs incurred in responding to other parties year computer system deficiencies  together with the cost of any required modifications to the company s ancillary systems  will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in the ordinary course the company has improved its year readiness through recent systems upgrades as part of its usual capital improvement efforts 
to date  no specific expenditures have been made as a result of the year issue 
the company expects to fund any future costs through operating cash flows 
cost estimates for systems improvements are based on the company s estimates  which make numerous assumptions about future events 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be correct and actual costs could differ materially from these estimates 
most reasonably likely worst case scenarios for the company 
the company will continue to devote resources to address its year issues 
there is no assurance  however  that the company s products do not contain undetected year problems 
in addition  there is no assurance that the company s assessment of third party suppliers and vendors will be accurate or that the company has made inquiry of the appropriate vendors 
furthermore  it has been widely reported that a significant amount of litigation surrounding business interruptions will arise out of year issues 
it is uncertain whether  or to what extent  the company may be affected by such litigation 
year problems could result in system failures  data corruption  the generation of erroneous information and other significant disruptions of business activities 
the company s contingency plan 
the company does not have a contingency plan 
fei is in the process of evaluating the need for a contingency plan and expects to finish the evaluation by mid forward looking statements from time to time the company may issue forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
the statements in this report concerning increased investment in plant and equipment and software development  the portions of the company s sales consisting of international sales  expected capital requirements  and year compliance by the company and its customers and suppliers constitute forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
factors that could materially decrease the company s investment in plant and equipment and software development include  but are not limited to  downturns in the ic manufacturing market  lower than expected customer orders and changes in product sales mix 
factors that could materially reduce the portion of the company s sales consisting of international sales include  but are not limited to  competitive factors  including increased international competition  new product offerings by competitors and price pressures  fluctuations in interest and exchange rates including changes in relevant foreign currency exchange rates between time of sale and time of payment  changes in trade policies  tariff regulations and business conditions and growth in the electronics industry and general economies  both domestic and foreign 
factors that could materially increase the company s capital requirements include  but are not limited to  receipt of a significant portion of customer orders and product shipments near the end of a quarter and the other factors listed above 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents certain unaudited financial data for each of the eight quarters in and in the opinion of management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial information appearing elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except for the adjustments described in the following paragraph  necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for these periods 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the results for the three months ended march  include the following non recurring adjustments i write off of purchased in process research and development costs totaling million recognized in the peo combination  ii restructuring and reorganization costs totaling million in connection with the company s decision to transfer certain manufacturing processes from massachusetts to eindhoven  the netherlands  and iii write off of capitalized software costs totaling million included in research and development expenses 
the results for the three months ended september  include the following non recurring adjustments i restructuring and reorganization costs totaling million in connection with the company s reduction in force  ii write off of the company s million investment in norsam  iii inventory write offs and obsolescence reserves totaling million primarily related to the consolidation of us field service operations  iv increased warranty reserves of million reflecting the increased cost of warranty for in line fibs  and v million of product upgrade reserves reflecting the decision to replace certain third party components within the installed base of one of the company s products 
the results for the three months ended december  include restructuring and reorganization charges totaling million

accounting literature states that such accounting is permitted in related party transactions when the presumption of repayment is overcome 
in september  the company terminated the research and development contract before its completion and agreed to settle obligations to philips machine shop aggregating approximately million 
given that amounts were paid to philips machine shop 
for reasons other than the successful completion of the research and development efforts  the company believes it can no longer assert that the presumption of repayment was overcome 
accordingly  the company has restated its quarterly results for the first  second and third quarters of to recognize the research and development costs in the quarters they were incurred 
the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
fluctuations in operating results may be caused by a variety of factors  including the relatively high unit cost of the company s microelectronic products and electron optics products  competitive pricing pressure  conditions in the semiconductor industry  the timing of orders from major customers and new product introductions  customer cancellation or delay of shipments  long sales cycles  changes in the mix of products sold and the proportion of domestic and international sales  specific feature requests by customers  product delays and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company will continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of microelectronic products and electron optics products 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition from a single order could have a significant impact on the company s net sales and operating results for a reporting period 
a substantial portion of the company s net sales have generally been realized near the end of each quarter and sales of electron optics products to government funded customers have generally been significantly higher in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  delays in shipments near the end of a quarter could have a substantial negative effect on operating results for that quarter 
announcements by the company or its competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of the company s existing systems  which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s sales and operating results in any future period cannot be forecast with certainty 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a large portion of the company s business is conducted outside of the united states through a number of foreign subsidiaries 
each of the foreign subsidiaries keeps its accounting records in its respective local currency 
these local currency denominated accounting records are translated at exchange rates which fluctuate up or down from period to period and consequently affect the consolidated result 
the major foreign currencies in which the company faces periodic fluctuations are the dutch guilder  the german mark  the british pound sterling  the italian lira  and the japanese yen 
although for the last three years more than of the company s sales occur outside of the united states  a large proportion of these sales are denominated in us dollars and dutch guilders 
as a result  despite an overall strengthening of the us dollar  net sales were adversely affected by only 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated as of the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments increased shareholders equity and comprehensive income for by million 
the company s primary exposure to changes in foreign currency results from inter company loans made between the us and dutch subsidiaries and its other foreign subsidiaries 
the company does not actively hedge this exposure and the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company does from time to time enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies to hedge specific sales transactions 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of these contracts was million 
holding other variables constant  if the us dollar weakened by  the market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding at december  would decrease by approximately million 
the decrease in value would be substantially offset from the revaluation of the underlying transactions hedged 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company borrows funds under variable rate borrowing arrangements 
as of december  and during the entire period  the company did not hedge its interest rate risk 
the company would not experience a material impact on its income before taxes as the result of a increase in the short term interest rates which are used to calculate its interest expense
