item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s net premiums earned by principal lines of insurance for the three years indicated and the dollar amount and percentage of change therein from year to year increase decrease to to amount amount dollar amounts in thousands general liability      medical malpractice      surety      workers compensation     commercial multi peril      commercial earthquake     specialty personal lines      credit related products     other      total      the following table sets forth the expense components of the company s combined ratio calculated as a percentage of net premiums earned on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles gaap combined ratio for the three years indicated losses loss adjustment expenses lae losses and lae underwriting and other operating expenses gaap combined ratio calendar year compared to calendar year a variety of factors accounted for the growth in net premiums earned  the principal factor being increases in the company s core and new program businesses in the general liability  surety  workers compensation  and commercial multi peril lines of business 
net premiums earned also grew due to the acquisitions of lyndon in may and acceleration in january  which provide credit related products  western in december  which offers medical malpractice coverage and environmental commercial insurance agency  inc eci in december which produces policies for environmental risks in the general liability line 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in medical malpractice business  commercial earthquake business  the planned decrease in a general liability program for apartment owners and to increased premiums ceded under the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaty 
the increase in general liability net premiums earned was primarily attributable to increased business written in the environmental  excess and surplus lines division  primarily due to the acquisition of eci  and to increased writings in the specialty programs division in various programs such as camp  pest control and artisan contractors 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the specialty programs division  primarily due to a discontinued program for apartment owners  and to decreased writings of excess workers compensation in the alternative risk division due to competition 
medical malpractice net premiums earned in the health care division decreased  primarily due to the sale of the florida physicians business in december this decrease was partially offset by the increase in business from the acquisition of western  and to increased writings for physicians  dentists and psychiatrists due to geographic expansion 
the growth in the surety line was primarily attributable to expanded writings of license and permit bonds  service contract bonds  customs bonds  lost instrument bonds  self insured workers compensation bonds  landfill bonds and subdivision bonds  partially offset by a decrease in the contract bond business for small contractors due to increased price competition 
net premiums earned for the workers compensation line increased due to increased writings in the alternative risk division  primarily in the captive and rent a captive programs  and to business acquired in the western acquisition and written in the health care division 
the growth in commercial multi peril net premiums earned was due to increased writings in the health care division  primarily in day care and other health care facilities and institutions 
net premiums earned in the commercial earthquake line written in the alternative risk division decreased primarily due to the planned decrease in this program 
the growth in specialty personal lines and credit related products was due to increased volume as a result of the acquisitions of lyndon and acceleration and to increased business in the mobile homeowners program 
net premiums earned in the other lines of business increased  primarily due to an increase in volume written in the alternative risk  specialty programs  and health care divisions  primarily in the group accident and health  ocean marine  international property and commercial auto liability lines of business 
net investment income before realized capital gains and losses increased due principally to increased cash flow from operations and the contribution to net investment income from the acquisitions made in  partially offset by the interest charge on funds held by the company for the benefit of the reinsurer of the company s aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contract

losses and lae increased as a result of a increase in losses and a increase in lae 
amortization of policy acquisition costs  underwriting and other expenses increased as a result of a increase in amortization of policy acquisition costs and a increase in underwriting and other expenses 
the increase in losses and lae was primarily due to a million reserve strengthening in the medical malpractice  general liability and surety lines of business 
the increase in medical malpractice losses and lae was primarily due to poor results in business written for individual physician malpractice in various states  primarily in the state of ohio  and to adverse reserve development in the large account program

amortization of policy acquisition costs  underwriting and other expenses expenses increased in the health care division primarily due to the acquisition of western and to increases in staffing  and marketing expenses

expenses in the specialty programs division increased due to the costs associated with the opening of a new start up operation and to increased staffing and marketing costs 
expenses in the personal and credit related division increased due to the acquisition of acceleration in january  partially offset by the recognition of million of amortization of the excess of net assets over the purchase price associated with the lyndon acquisition 
expenses increased due to a million charge to cancel the aggregate excess stop loss agreement for the treaty year  an increase of approximately million in the allowance for doubtful accounts and a million restructuring charge related to the closing of one of the company s health care division offices 
the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of additional borrowings under the line of credit during the foregoing changes resulted in a net loss before taxes of million for the year ended versus net income before taxes of million for calendar year compared to calendar year a variety of factors accounted for the growth in net premiums earned  the principal factor being increases in the company s core and new program businesses in the general liability  surety  medical malpractice and commercial multi peril lines of business 
net premiums earned also grew due to the acquisitions of lyndon  which writes personal lines and credit related products  united capitol  which provides general liability coverage for environmental and artisan contractors and  to a lesser degree western  which offers medical malpractice coverage 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in workers compensation  particularly the cotton gin program and social service programs that the company discontinued during due to price competition 
the increase in general liability net premiums earned was primarily attributable to increase business written in the environmental  excess and surplus lines division  primarily due to the acquisition of united capitol  growth in programs in the specialty programs divisions  primarily in the artisan s contractor and demolition contractor programs  and to growth in the excess employers liability program in the alternative risk division 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the specialty programs division  primarily due competition in the crane operators liability program and to decreased writings for umbrella coverages 
medical malpractice net premiums earned in the health care division increased  primarily attributable to an increase in the number of physicians insured in the programs for psychiatrists and alternative risks  geographical expansion in ohio  texas  michigan  and illinois and growth in the dental program endorsed by the academy of general dentistry and  to a lesser degree  the acquisition of western in december these increases were partially offset by a decrease in florida business due to rate increases  the sale of the florida medical malpractice business and from the reclassification of certain medical malpractice business to the general liability line 
the growth in the surety line was primarily attributable to expanded writings of license and permit bonds  service contract bonds  customs bonds  lost instrument bonds  self insured workers compensation bonds  landfill bonds and subdivision bonds 
the growth in the surety division was partially offset by decrease in the contract bond business for small contractors due to price competition 
net premiums earned for the workers compensation line decreased primarily as a result of decreases in the specialty niche programs for the cotton gin and feed lots written in the specialty programs division and in the health care division in programs associated with social services due to price competition 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in the captive and rent a captive programs written in the alternative risk division 
the growth in the commercial multi peril net premiums earned was due to increased writings in the health care division  primarily due to an increase in business written for day care and other healthcare related facilities and institutions 
net premiums earned in the commercial earthquake line written in the alternative risk division decreased  primarily due to the planned decrease in this business 
the growth in specialty personal lines and in the credit related products lines was due to increased volume written in the personel and credit related division as a result of the acquisition of lyndon and to increased business in the mobile homeowner s program 
net premiums earned in the other lines of business increased  primarily due to an increase in volume written in the alternative risk  specialty programs  and health care division  primarily in the group accident and health  ocean marine  international property and commercial auto liability lines 
net investment income before realized capital gains and losses increased due principally to increases in invested assets resulting from proceeds of the common stock offering in august  the convertible trust originated preferred securities convertible toprs offering in october  cash flow from operations and the contribution to net investment income from the acquisitions made in  partially offset by the interest charge on funds held by the company for the benefit of the reinsurer of the company s aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contract

losses and lae increased at a rate as a result of a increase in losses and a increase in lae 
amortization of policy acquisition costs  underwriting and other expenses increased rate as a result of a increase in amortization of policy acquisition costs and a increase in underwriting and other expenses 
the increase in losses and lae was primarily due to a million reserve increase in the medical malpractice line in the health care division  primarily due to adverse reserve development in accident years prior to amortization and policy acquisition costs  underwriting and other expenses expenses increased in the health care division  primarily due to the acquisition of western in december and to increased staffing and marketing expenses related to expansion  and salary increases

expenses in the environmental  excess and surplus lines division increased primarily due to the acquisition of united capitol in and to increased staffing and marketing expenses related to expansion 
expenses in the surety  specialty programs and alternative risk divisions increased due to increased staffing and marketing expenses related to expansion  and salary increases 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of the repayment and termination of the line of credit in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by the interest expense associated with the draw down of million from a revolving credit facility that the company obtained on june  the foregoing changes resulted in net income before taxes of million for the year ended  a decrease from the comparable period 
asset portfolio review the company invests primarily in fixed income securities with the objective of maximizing after tax investment income and total investment returns within approved investment guidelines 
the core investment portfolio contains fixed maturity securities which are rated investment grade 
at december   the company held investment grade rated securities with a carrying value of billion  representing of total fixed maturity investments 
fixed maturity investments with credit ratings below investment grade  which are maintained as part of the alternative iinvestment portfolio  totaled million at december  and represented the balance of the total fixed maturity investments 
at december  and  the company s fixed maturity investments included mortgage backed securities of million and million  respectively  which are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans that differ from typical fixed maturities 
securities that have an amortized cost greater than par value that are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield  while securities that have an amortized cost less than par value that are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment risk and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall structure of a securitization 
the company limits the extent of its credit risk by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral with enhanced priority in the securitization structure 
the credit risk is minimized as the majority of the company s mortgage backed portfolio is guaranteed by us government sponsored entities or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities resulting in bonds with high investment grade ratings 
the portfolio is actively managed to minimize the company s exposure to prepayment and extension risk 
as of december   the company s asset and mortgage backed holdings were rated aa and aaa  respectively  by moody s 
the alternative investment portfolio includes investments in limited partnerships with carrying values of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the partnerships have varying investment strategies and these investments were made by the company with the objective of long term capital appreciation 
the investments generally contain lock up provisions which require the company to hold the investments for a specified time horizon and have limited liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources the company is a holding company  receiving cash principally through sales of its securities  borrowings and management fees charged to its subsidiaries 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to dividend restrictions as described in note q of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the ability of insurance companies to underwrite insurance is based on maintaining liquidity and capital resources sufficient to pay claims and expenses as they become due 
the liquidity needs of the company s insurance subsidiaries are generally met through cash provided by operating activities 
however  during  additional funds of approximately million were contributed to the insurance subsidiaries as a result of significant reserve strengthening and the need to maintain certain minimum surplus levels 
such funds were obtained through the company s million credit facility with deutsche bank ag  new york branch  of which million remained available to the company at december  under the terms of the credit facility  the company is subject to certain financial and non financial covenants  some of which restrict its ability to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and require the maintenance of a minimum level of consolidated shareholders equity 
cash flow needs at the holding company level primarily include corporate operating expenses and interest payments on outstanding debt  for which funding is provided through management fees charged to the company s subsidiaries 
net proceeds of million from a common stock offering in and million from the sale of convertible toprs during provided the principal funding for the strategic acquisitions completed during the three years ended december  see note c of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has authorized a stock repurchase plan for up to million shares of its common stock under which it repurchased  shares at a cost of million during although the company plans to continue to repurchase its common to the extent market conditions make such repurchases strategically advantageous  it has no commitment or obligation to purchase any particular number of shares and the program may be suspended at the company s discretion 
the company continually monitors existing and alternative financing sources to support the company s capital and liquidity needs  including  but not limited to debt issuance and preferred or common stock issuance 
rating agencies ratings assigned by nationally recognized agencies are major factors in the company s ability to market the products of its insurance subsidiaries to its agents and customers since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
all of the company s insurance subsidiaries  except lyndon life  gulfco life and acceleration  are currently rated a excellent by am best company  inc am best 
am best s current ratings for lyndon life and gulfco life are b very good  and its rating for acceleration is b very 
standard poor s s p has assigned a financial strength rating of a strong to all of the company s insurance subsidiaries  except for regency  which is rated a strong and acceleration and gulfco  which have not been assigned ratings by s p 
in order to maintain frontier s current rating with am best  the company has made certain commitments  including maintaining a minimum statutory surplus level of million and limiting its premium to surplus ratio to no more than to am best s and s p s ratings are based on an analysis of financial condition and operations of an insurance company as they relate to the industry in general  are not designed for the protection of investors and do not constitute recommendations to buy  sell  or hold any security 
solvency and surplus matters in its ongoing effort to improve solvency regulation  the naic and individual states have enacted certain laws and financial statement changes 
the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks  such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specific corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows yyy ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level or  with negative trend 
at december  and  the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the company s insurance subsidiaries were in excess of to in addition  state insurance statutes typically place restrictions on the maximum amount of dividends or other distributions that may be made by insurance companies to their shareholders without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
such restrictions are typically related to the insurance companies statutory capital and surplus 
see note q of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the naic adopted codified statutory accounting principles codification 
codification will likely change  to some extent  prescribed statutory accounting practices and may result in changes to the accounting practices that the ccompany s insurance subsidiaries use to prepare their statutory basis financial statements 
codification will require adoption by the various states before it becomes the prescribed statutory basis of accounting for insurance companies domesticated within those states 
accordingly  before codification becomes effective for the company s insurance subsidiaries  their respective state of domicile must adopt codification as the prescribed basis of accounting for domestic insurers to report their statutory basis results to the insurance department 
at this time  it is unclear which of the various states will adopt codification 
management has not yet determined the impact of codification on the statutory surplus of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the thrust of these regulatory efforts is to improve the solvency of insurance companies 
these regulatory initiatives  and the overall focus on solvency  may intensify the restructuring and consolidation of the insurance industry 
while the impact of these regulatory efforts on the company s operations cannot be quantified until enacted  the company believes it will be adequately positioned to compete in an environment of more stringent regulation 
zurich reinsurance north america stop loss agreements effective january   the company entered into a stop loss reinsurance agreement with zurich reinsurance north america  inc zurich na  formerly centre reinsurance company of new york for accident years commencing under the agreement  zurich na provides reinsurance protection within certain accident year and contract aggregate dollar limits for losses and lae in excess of a predetermined ratio of these expenses to net premiums earned for a given accident year for all subject business 
the loss and lae ratio above which the reinsurance provides coverage is   and for accident years through  respectively 
the maximum amount recoverable for an accident year is of the reinsurance premium paid for the accident year  or million in the aggregate for the three years 
as of december   the company had exceeded the aggregate limits of the contract 
see note i of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company entered into a stop loss reinsurance agreement with zurich na for the and accident years 
the new agreement included selected programs underwritten by united capitol  western  and selected core programs of frontier and frontier pacific  which were not part of the original reinsurance agreement 
under the terms of the new agreement  zurich na provided reinsurance protection within certain contract aggregate dollar limits for losses and lae in excess of a predetermined ratio of these expenses to earned premiums for a given accident year for the covered insurance programs 
effective december   the company and zurich na agreed to terminate this agreement for the accident year 
see note i of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
litigation with the state of new york over the past decade  the company has been engaged in litigation with the state of new york as to whether physician medical school faculty members at the state university of new york suny engaged in the clinical practice of medicine at a suny medical school facility  corollary to such physicians faculty activities  were within the scope of their employment by suny  and thereby protected against malpractice claims arising out of such activity by the state  or by the company under its medical malpractice policies insuring the suny physicians 
as a result of favorable judicial decisions  the company recorded subrogation recoverables for claims previously paid and reserves established with respect to such malpractice claims of approximately million on december  and million on june  the company and the state reached an agreement with respect to cases pursuant to which the state paid million to the company in september and the company agreed to forego in interest 
as a result  the amount of subrogation recoverables recorded at december  amounted to approximately million 
discussions are continuing with respect to the cases not included in the agreement with the state and  to the extent the amount of the actual recovery varies from the recorded subrogation recoveries of million  such difference will be reported in the period recognized 
the company is continuing to defend all suny faculty members against malpractice claims that have been asserted and is maintaining reserves adjusted for the anticipated recoveries 
impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae  or the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  are known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  the company may be limited in raising its premiums commensurate with anticipated inflation  in which event the company  rather than its insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on the company s investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on the company s investment income 
the year the company has a committee comprised of senior management from the corporate office and from each of its subsidiaries to develop and implement a uniform and complete year compliance plan 
an assessment of all systems that could be affected by year issues has been completed 
for its information technology it exposures  the company is nearing completion of the remediation of its systems 
those remediated systems which have been implemented have been tested for compliance for th century system dates with current and st century data and  with the exception of one system  st century system dates with th and st century data 
processes and procedures are currently in place to ensure that all future it development and testing follow year standards  that all projects undertaken in the interim deliver year compliant solutions  that all future third party hardware and software acquisitions are year compliant  and that all commercial third party service providers  including agents and program administrators  are queried regarding their year compliance plans 
to date  the costs related to year compliance efforts are approximately million and have been expensed as incurred 
total costs are not expected to exceed million and will continue to be funded out of operating cash flows 
however  anticipated costs could be adversely affected by the continued need for availability of personnel and system resources  as well as any failure by third party vendors  service providers  or agencies to properly address year issues 
the impact of achieving yk compliance has not caused a significant delay in other it related development efforts 
the company has also conducted a comprehensive review of its underwriting guidelines and is seeking regulatory approval of an endorsement to be added to all commercial property and casualty policies which would clarify that coverage is not afforded losses resulting from year noncompliance by insureds 
upon approval  this endorsement is being added to each policy at either issuance or renewal 
underwriting policy and protocol have been developed to address nonapproving states and business situations that cannot be endorsed 
to date  the company has received endorsement approval from states and the district of columbia 
for these reasons  the company believes its exposure to year claims will not be material to its operations or financial condition 
however  due to social and legal trends  it is impossible to predict what  if any  exposure insurance companies generally may have relating to year claims 
a contingency plan is currently being developed which will delineate the company s responsibilities in the event that year compliance is not achieved due to internal or external factors 
these plans involve  among other things  manual workarounds  additional paper based report development and adjusting staffing strategies 
the company recognizes the need for a contingency plan  but given the status of its current yk efforts does not anticipate having to rely on the plan 
the company expects to continue to conduct periodic tests of its systems throughout to complete testing for various conditions  and to further ensure continued year compliance is maintained 
the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve year issues in a timely manner 
however  risks remain that as yet untested or undiscovered computer system problems will emerge 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from the year could also materially adversely affect the company  rendering it unable to receive premiums or settle its insureds claims in a timely manner 
in addition  the company could be subject to litigation for claims related to its insureds year exposures 
environmental issues the company  through its subsidiary united capitol  in the ordinary course of business  writes insurance on accounts which have hazardous  unique or unusual risk characteristics 
since united capitol s organization in  its liability policies have included an absolute pollution coverage exclusion  except for policies specifically designed and underwritten to cover environmental exposures pollution 
in addition  united capitol s product liability and other primary general liability policies contain exclusions for coverage of claims for bodily injury or property damage caused by exposure to asbestos  other than for the policies providing coverage to asbestos abatement contractors for third party claims alleging bodily injury or property damage as a result of exposure to asbestos 
employees of the insured contractor and others required to be in the abatement area are excluded from coverage 
although the company believes that such policies  together with the company s general  professional and other liability policies  do not subject it to material exposure for environmental pollution claims  there can be no assurance of the company s continued protection in view of the expansion of liability for environmental claims in recent litigation in the insurance industry 
shareholder litigation following the company s november  announcement of its third quarter financial results  the company was served with seven purported class actions alleging violations of federal securities laws by the company and  in some cases  by certain of its officers and directors 
in september  a pre trial order was signed which consolidated all actions in the eastern district of new york  appointed three law firms as co lead counsel for the plaintiffs and set forth a timetable for class certification  motion practice and discovery 
in november  plaintiffs served a consolidated amended complaint alleging violations by the company of section b of the securities exchange act of and rule b thereunder  seeking to impose controlling person liability on certain of the company s officers and directors  and further alleging insider sales  all premised on negative financial information that should have been publicly disclosed earlier 
plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount in damages to be proven at trial  reasonable attorney fees and expert witness costs 
in april  the court certified the class 
plaintiffs have subpoenaed documents and deposed outside auditors and analysts 
plaintiffs have also taken depositions from current or former officers  directors and employees of the company 
the company believes the suit is without merit  has retained special legal counsel to contest this suit vigorously and believes that the company s exposure to liability  if any  thereunder would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk frontier s investment portfolio is subject to market risk arising from the potential change in the value of the various securities held within the portfolio 
market risk comprises many factors  such as interest rate risk  liquidity risk  prepayment risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess these market risks 
the market risks which most affect the company s investment portfolio are interest rate risk and equity price risk 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security or portfolio to changes in interest rates 
table below sets forth the impact of hypothetical interest rate changes on the fair value of fixed maturity securities held at december  the sensitivity analysis measures the change in fair values arising from immediate changes in selected interest rate scenarios 
hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus and basis points bp were employed in the 
additionally  based upon the yield curve shifts  estimations of prepayment speeds for the mortgage backed securities and the likelihood of call or put options being exercised were also employed in this analysis
