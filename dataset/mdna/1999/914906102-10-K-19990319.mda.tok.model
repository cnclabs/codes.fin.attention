year issues like most businesses today  the company is reliant on computer systems and other electronic and mechanical technologies in carrying out its operations and managing its resources 
some of the company s operations  such as signal distribution and television audience ratings  are either carried out through or supported by third parties  while approximately of the company s programming is sourced from third parties 
approximately of univision s programming distribution including commercial spots is provided through its o os with the remainder provided via its broadcast and cable affiliates 
except for the network and its fresno  miami  phoenix  sacramento and san antonio o os  which are located in company owned properties  all other operations are situated in facilities leased from and maintained by third parties 
the company s business is primarily contracted through advertising agencies and to a lesser degree from direct local market advertisers collectively  advertisers 
no single advertiser represents more than of the company s advertising revenues 
the sales order entry and nielsen rating systems used by the company are mainframe based 
these systems are owned and maintained by third party vendors and located in such vendors facilities 
the remaining computer systems of the company are not mainframe based and use standard industry specific software applications 
the year issue results from computer software programs written to use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year instead of the year computer programs used by the company s suppliers as defined below may experience the same date recognition issues 
if this occurs  the potential exists for computer system failures or miscalculations by computer programs used by the company and its suppliers  which could cause disruption of the company s operations 
through its year project office project office  the company continues its effort to assess its year readiness as well as that of its advertisers  satellite service providers  programming suppliers  broadcast affiliates  nielsen rating service  landlords  and vendors and other suppliers that may be critical to the company s business collectively  suppliers unless the context indicates otherwise 
the project office is staffed with the company s two principal engineers and representatives from management information systems and from the legal  risk management  finance  and operations departments 
an independent consulting firm with broadcasting systems integration experience assisted with the assessment phase of the company s year program 
such firm is assisting the company with the verification efforts of its broadcasting systems and equipment 
in addressing its year readiness  the company has been engaged in a five part program that consists of the following assessment 
this phase is three fold 
part one is the location and identification of all computer systems  software products  building systems and equipment with embedded systems used within each operational unit of the company the systems inventory 
part two is the identification of mission critical systems within each of the operational units 
part three is the evaluation including communicating with manufacturers with respect to their equipment of systems to determine whether such systems will be able to process data before  on and after january  mission critical systems have been given priority in the evaluation process 
corrective action 
systems and equipment that are non compliant are being retired  repaired or replaced 
mission critical items are being given priority 
verification 
corrective measures are to be verified by both current date and future date testing 
any necessary remedial action identified during this phase will be taken and verified 
mission critical items are being given priority 
communications 
the company implemented a communication program with its suppliers to understand their year issues  to determine how such issues could impact the company s operations and to determine the suppliers year mitigation plans to address or manage the issues that relate to the company s business and  with respect to landlords  the leased facilities 
contingency plans 
contingency plans are being formulated to continue network and o o broadcasting operations without interruption prior to  during and after january  although work on the different parts of the year program has been taking place concurrently  the primary focus is on corrective action and verification activities  particularly with respect to equipment computer and mechanical technology that is critical to the company s broadcasting operations signal  programming and commercial spot distribution on its network and o os 
the assessment of equipment critical to the company s broadcasting operations was completed in december the targeted date for the completion of all phases of the year program is september   subject to suppliers responsiveness to the company s inquiries of their year issues and timely delivery of certain year compliant software 
verification activities began in and will continue through the company s contingency plans are expected to be completed by the end of april based on the work completed through march   on the year program all of the equipment critical to the distribution of our broadcast signal without content and for the insertion and delivery of content has been year assessed 
approximately of the corrective work identified in the assessment phase has been completed with remainder scheduled for completion by may   subject to the timely availability of year software solutions from broadcast equipment vendors 
the company s major satellite provider informed the company in august that the satellite carrying the network feed has been tested and is year ready 
the satellite provider notified the company in february that it expects to complete corrective work and testing on the corresponding satellite ground system by june  the systems critical to our sales  marketing and research operations have been assessed 
corrective work identified in the assessment phase continues with expected completion by september  the systems used in our administrative operations or by our outside service providers finance  payroll  benefits administration have been assessed 
corrective work identified in the assessment phase continues with expected completion by april  the assessment efforts of our facilities infrastructures owned and leased combined is expected to continue through september  corrective work identified on company owned communications  lan and desktop systems is being undertaken concurrently with the assessment activities and is complete 
the assessment of hvac  elevators  security and other building systems in company owned facilities is more than complete  with corrective work in progress 
management companies of leased facilities have not been as responsive as other suppliers to the company s year readiness requests  and efforts to obtain such information are continuing 
of the total corrective work identified for all phases of our program  approximately has been completed 
capital as well as personnel and non personnel costs related to the year program have not been material 
although additional remedial and verification activities remain to be completed  the company does not expect that the future costs related to the company s internal year issues will have a material impact on the company s operations  subject to completion of the corrective work and contingency planning phases and the availability of solutions from suppliers 
the company will fund the costs to resolve its year issues primarily from its operating cash flow and  if necessary  proceeds available under its bank facility 
the company expects that its systems will be fully operational and will not cause any material disruptions because of year issues 
because of the uncertainties associated with assessing the preparedness of suppliers  there is a risk of a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations if the company s suppliers are not capable of correcting their year issues 
the company s major risk centers around its ability to transmit the network and o os broadcast signals and satisfy the contractual commitments to air the commercial spots of its advertisers 
the company s contingency planning process is addressing these risks 
seasonality the advertising revenues of the company vary over the calendar year 
historically  approximately of total advertising revenues have been generated in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter  with the remainder split approximately equally between the second and third quarters  exclusive of special programming such as the world cup games 
because of the relatively fixed nature of the costs of the company s business  seasonal variations in operating income are more pronounced than those of revenues 
impact of inflation management believes that the impact of inflation on the company s business has not been material
