as a result of the merger  each outstanding share of naco common stock was converted into shares of abc common stock  resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares 
the merger was treated as a tax free reorganization for federal income tax purposes and is accounted for as a pooling of interests transaction

the company intends to file a form q quarterly report for the fiscal quarter ending october  and a form k transition report for the five month transition period from august  to december  results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated net sales and gross profit data for the indicated fiscal years dollars in millions net sales gross profit of sales in fiscal  annual net sales increased to million from million in fiscal fiscal net sales increased from million in fiscal in fiscal  the increase was due in part to the ongoing ramp up of the sahagun  mexico  facility as well as continued strong market conditions within the rail products segment 
these conditions were a direct result of a strong domestic economy that increased demand for freight car components and locomotive truck assemblies 
the increase from to was driven primarily within the rail products and rail services and systems segments  once again  as a result of the strong overall economy 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly in fiscal to from in fiscal however  these numbers were both improvements upon fiscal s percentage of 
the overall improvement in margin from  when compared to the years and  was driven entirely within the rail products segment for the reasons described above

the charge also includes amounts associated with the company s initiatives to merge the corporate operations of the two companies  to eliminate duplicate functions and to restructure certain operations within the rail products segment by closing three manufacturing operations 
the components of the charge have been computed based on actual cash payouts  management s estimate of the realizable value of the affected tangible and intangible assets  and estimated exit costs including severance and other employee benefits based on existing severance policies 
employee severance costs included in the charge totaled million and included amounts for approximately corporate employees  salaried plant employees and hourly employees 
as of july   approximately of these employees had been terminated 
the remaining are expected to be terminated by early calendar year the restructuring of certain operations within the rail products segment was prompted by the excess capacity resulting from the operation of the company s new state of the art rail mill facility in chicago heights  illinois 
with this new capacity on line  the company decided to close its cincinnati  ohio facility and to discontinue manufacturing at its newton  kansas facility which also has a distribution operation 
as a result of the merger  the company also decided to close its foundry operation in anderson  indiana that produced manganese castings used in specialty track products for the railroad industry 
production was shifted in early august to the company s richmond  texas facility 
in addition  the company decided to consolidate its corporate facilities and close an administrative office 
costs associated with the closure of these facilities  excluding severance  are million in non cash provisions for the write down of obsolete assets and leasehold improvements  and million in cash provisions for idle facility and property disposal costs

seasonality the peak season for installation of specialty trackwork extends from march through october  when weather conditions are generally favorable for installation and  as a result  net sales of specialty trackwork have historically been more concentrated in the period from january through june  a period roughly corresponding to the second half of the company s fiscal year 
in addition  a number of the company s facilities close for regularly scheduled maintenance in the late summer and late december  which tends to reduce operating results during the first half of the company s fiscal year 
transit industry practice with respect to specialty trackwork generally involves the periodic shipment of large quantities  which may be unevenly distributed throughout the year 
the company  except where noted  does not expect any significant departure from the historical demand patterns during the present fiscal year ending december  year issues in addressing the year yk issues  the company has taken initiatives in three general areas information technology it and communication systems  non it systems and related third party issues 
the following is a summary of these programs 
it and communication systems since late  the company  in support of its strategic initiatives and business process reengineering  has significantly upgraded and continues to upgrade its information technology and communication systems 
this upgrade includes but is not limited to enterprise wide application systems sap s r system  migration from midsize computers to client server based systems  upgraded personal computers pc s  upgraded pc software standardized on windows nt  windows x  microsoft exchange  microsoft office suite and back office applications software  sdrc ideas d cad and auto cad and pro engineering  local area networks lan s  wide area networks wan s  and network integration of advanced fax  printer  and advanced copier systems 
a by product of these endeavors is that a large portion of the company s it and non voice communication systems  and many of its voice communication systems are now yk compliant 
in addition  during  the former naco companies initiated a program for the installation of an integrated manufacturing and financial software package primarily to have the necessary tools to streamline  standardize and simplify the business processes at all of its facilities 
this project includes the migration from system s  vax and pc dos systems located at various locations to two yk compliant hp servers utilizing roi s fully integrated manage application software 
implementation of the new manage system was started in april and is scheduled for completion in october and will include the former naco s five manufacturing locations 
the company s current exceptions to yk compliance are one hp mid size computer running yk non compliant software is not yet removed from operation  shop labor collection at a manufacturing facility  third party payroll software and up to half of the phone systems pbx s at the company s plants need to be upgraded or replaced 
these issues are anticipated to be remediated by the fall of calendar year non it systems internal non it systems comprised mainly of building air management systems  elevator systems  security and fire control systems  safety systems  equipment and machinery operating and control systems  compressed air  electrical and natural gas systems  and equipment such as lift trucks  mobile cranes  etc  were assessed by third party consultants specializing in yk compliance and remediation planning 
these assessments are complete and remediation is expected to be completed in october  third parties year compliance letters have been sent to the company s major third parties customers  vendors  service providers  etc 
to ensure that all significant future business associates are addressing and preparing for the year the company continues to work with all significant third parties and has initiated a tracking system to monitor responses and resolve issues as they arise 
major customers report having had yk compliance programs running for at least one to two years and indicate that their systems that interact with the company are or will be compliant for yk 
based on our discussions  assessment of the customers capability  and long time customer operating practices  the company believes that these key customers will be yk compliant in all material matters affecting the company 
as previously indicated  the company will continue to monitor its customers yk compliance 
yk compliance costs to date  the company s yk compliance has been a by product of the company s strategic initiatives and business process re engineering focused upgrades of it and communications systems 
the sap s r system and roi s manage system installation in the company s plants will complete that program 
no material added efforts or cost were incurred apart from these initiatives and upgrades to directly remediate the company s yk compliance issues 
the specific yk it and communication system remediation tasks previously outlined were accomplished by in house is and user personnel whose costs are recorded as normal operating expense 
the it system software upgrades are being executed under ongoing maintenance and support agreements with software vendors  and the bios upgrades to certain hardware are being executed under similar arrangements with hardware vendors 
the replacement cost of non remediable pc s  network hardware components  copiers and fax machines were not material 
the company has estimated the cost of non it system and third party compliance issues  but has no reason to believe  based upon its evaluations that such costs  in the aggregate  would be material 
yk risks the principal risks to the company relating to the completion of its compliance conversion efforts related to its it and communications systems are 
failure to implement manage integrated software at former naco facilities on a timely basis 

failure to replace non compliant labor data collection systems 
the principal risks to the company relating to non it systems are failures in control systems for significant machines and equipment or facility systems 
these risks are expected to be addressed by october  the principal risk to the company in its relationship with related third parties is failure of third party systems used to conduct such third parties business including customers  rail suppliers and suppliers of financial and outsourced investor and employee information and management services 
based on yk compliance work done to date  the company believes its key customers are currently yk compliant or will be yk compliant in all material respects and that service suppliers will be yk compliant or can be replaced within an acceptable time frame 
the company has obtained compliance certification from suppliers of key services as soon as such certifications were available 
other than rail supplied by key customers  who indicated they are yk compliant  the company currently believes that other raw materials do not pose a significant risk 
contingency plans the company s description of its yk compliance issue is based upon information obtained by the company through evaluations of the company s it communication systems and customer and supplier yk compliance 
the company can give no assurance  however  than it will be able to address the year issues for all of its current software applications in a timely manner or that the company will not encounter unexpected difficulties or other expenses relating to adequately addressing the year issue 
if the company or its major customers  suppliers or other third parties with whom the company does business fail to address adequately the year issues  or the company fails to successfully integrate or convert its computer systems generally  the company s business or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
regarding forward looking statements the foregoing contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from current expectations due to a number of factors  including general economic conditions  competitive factors and pricing pressures  shifts in market demand  the performance and needs of industries served by the company s businesses  actual future costs of operating expenses such as rail and scrap steel  self insurance claims and employee wages and benefits  actual costs of continuing investments in technology  the availability of capital to finance possible acquisitions and to refinance debt  the ability of management to implement the company s long term business strategy of acquisitions  yk issues and the risks described from time to time in the company s sec reports 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk sensitive instruments do not subject the company to material market risk exposures  except as such risks relate to interest rate fluctuations 
as of july   the company has long term debt outstanding with a carrying value of million 
the estimated fair value of this debt is million 
the company historically has not entered into interest rate protection agreements 
fixed interest rate debt outstanding as of july  represents of total debt  carries an average interest of and matures as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million thereafter 
variable interest rate debt outstanding as of july  had an average interest rate at that date of and matures as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  zero in fiscal and million thereafter
