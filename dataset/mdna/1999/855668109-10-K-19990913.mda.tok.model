item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations sales sales decreased in fiscal following a increase in fiscal domestic sales were down in the current year  reflecting a downturn in the industrial manufacturing sector  and foreign sales were down 
the foreign decrease was due mostly to the devaluation of brazil s currency in january in terms of local currency  foreign sales were down only 
domestic sales accounted for most of the increase in the prior year as a result of continued good economic conditions in our industry through the end of fiscal for the past two years  the strong british pound has been adversely affecting scotland s business both in terms of export pricing and domestic import competition  and  in brazil  high real interest rates and a recessionary economy have held sales back 
the weakening of brazil s currency in and the devaluation in had the effect of reducing the local currency year to year sales change by percentage points in and percentage points in  after conversion to us dollars 
earnings before taxes pretax earnings are down for the year 
this follows a increase in cost of sales was in  in and in the changes in these rates are consistent with the manufacturing efficiencies that are gained or lost as a result of increased or decreased production levels  particularly in domestic operations where pretax earnings were up last year but are down this year 
on the foreign side  the strong pound mentioned above has had a significant negative effect on margins for the past two years 
in brazil  although the currency devaluation has reduced the absolute amount of pretax profits  its effect on importers with whom we compete has allowed our operation to improve margins in the current year 
income taxes the effective tax rate is in compared to in and in tax exempt interest on short term investments in municipal bonds  puerto rico tax incentives and somewhat lower foreign income tax rates all contribute to an overall effective tax rate that is slightly lower than the combined us state and federal statutory rate 
nonrecurring permanent differences between book and taxable income for dividends paid from brazil to the us in and particularly in have reduced their effective tax rate substantially when reported in us dollars 
net earnings as a result of the above  net earnings were down in fiscal when compared to and net earnings were up when compared to market risk market risk is the potential change in a financial instrument s value caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices 
the company s operating activities expose it to many risks that are continually monitored  evaluated  and managed 
proper management of these risks helps reduce the likelihood of earnings volatility 
at june and  the company was not a party to any derivative arrangement and the company does not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
the company does not engage in regular hedging activities to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
net monetary assets in scotland and brazil are approximately million and million  respectively 
inflation in brazil has decreased to less than today from over in when their current economic plan was initiated 
as a consequence  their economy ceased to be considered hyperinflationary as of january a change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the aggregate net fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments primarily variable rate investments of  and debt of  at june  or the cash flows or future earnings associated with those financial instruments 
a change in interest rates would impact the fair value of the company s fixed rate investments of approximately  by  year the company does not currently anticipate any material disruption of its operations as a result of failure by the company to be year compliant 
if  however  the company  its customers or its suppliers are unable to achieve year compliance  the potential exists for the company s business and results of operations to be adversely affected 
worldwide  the company has four major computer systems that are used in the areas of manufacturing  sales and accounting 
two use third party packages that the company believes are or  through vendor upgrades  will be year compliant 
the other two systems are in the process of being converted to third party packages that the company believes are already compliant 
the company expects to complete the reasonably necessary remediation of its significant systems by the end of calendar and has not incurred  and does not expect to incur  significant additional separately identifiable costs in order to make its computer systems year compliant 
if it begins to appear that the company s planned upgrades and modifications might fail to bring any of these major systems into year compliance or fail to do so in a timely manner  the company will have to adopt  and for one system has actually adopted  contingency plans to deal with any resulting disruptions in its business 
the company employs certain manufacturing processes that utilize computer controlled manufacturing equipment 
the company believes such equipment is year compliant to the extent reasonably necessary but has not completed its testing of such equipment 
in the event the company determines that such equipment cannot readily be made year compliant  it believes it can revert to the manual processes previously employed or outsource such work 
the company is also in the process of investigating the status of other systems with respect to year compliance such as phone  fax  heating air conditioning  and electricity and believes they will be year compliant to the extent reasonably necessary before the end of the company is utilizing internal resources for this purpose and does not expect to incur significant separately identifiable costs 
in addition to reviewing its own systems  the company has polled or is in the process of polling its significant customers and vendors to get assurance that they are year compliant and to attempt to identify potential issues 
to the extent such assurance is not received  appropriate contingency plans will be developed and implemented 
at this time  the company is not aware of significant problems 
if the company s customers and vendors do not achieve year compliance before the end of  the company could experience a variety of problems that might have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
for example  customers might lose edi capability or vendors might fail to deliver  but most foreseeable problems can be overcome by reverting to phone  fax  mail and other manual procedures 
it should be noted that the company outsources very little other than raw steel and is not dependent on single source suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources years ended in june cash provided by operations    cash used in investing activities    cash used in financing activities    effect of translation rate changes on cash increase decrease in cash   cash flows from operating activities decreased million in primarily due to the decrease in net earnings of million  and increases in inventory levels offset somewhat by a decrease in receivables  both of which are consistent with reduced sales volume 
just the opposite effect was experienced in the company s investing activities consist mainly of expenditures for property  plant and equipment and the investment of cash not immediately needed for operations 
plant expenditures of million in are ahead of the million and million experienced in and  which are more typical years  because of a major building expansion and continued investment in system software and hardware changes 
cash flows from financing activities are primarily the payment of dividends  which tend to be quite steady from year to year 
the company requires little debt to finance day to day operations and the proceeds from the sale of stock under the various stock plans tend to be used to purchase treasury shares 
treasury share purchases were million in compared to million in and million in the company maintains sufficient liquidity and has the resources to fund its operations under current business conditions 
the company maintains two lines of credit as discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
the company has not made significant borrowings under these lines during the past three years 
the lines were used primarily to finance acquisitions 
the company continues to maintain a strong financial position with a working capital ratio of to as of june  and to as of june  cash not immediately required for working capital is invested in high grade money market instruments with maturities generally less than one year however  see the notes to the financial statements regarding investments in puerto rico 
certain cash and investment balances of foreign subsidiaries may not be repatriated without adverse tax consequences and in certain cases may be subject to regulatory restriction 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
provides guidance for accounting for all derivative instruments  as defined 
this standard requires all derivatives and any hedging assets or liabilities to be accounted for at fair value and will be required to be implemented during fiscal the company is currently analyzing the impact of adopting sfas no 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this document and the annual report  including the chairman s letter to stockholders  include forward looking statements about the company s business  sales  expenditures  year compliance  environmental regulatory compliance  foreign operations  interest rate sensitivity  debt service  liquidity and capital resources  and other operating and capital requirements 
in addition  forward looking statements may be included in future company documents and in oral statements by company representatives to security analysts and investors 
the company is subject to risks that could cause actual events to vary materially from such forward looking statements  including the following risk factors risks related to year issues the company continues to explore whether and to what extent its computer and other systems will be disrupted at the turn of the century as a result of the widely publicized dating system flaw inherent in many computer systems 
while the company is in the process of upgrading and modifying its systems in order to address the year issue  there can be no assurance that the company s existing systems will be upgraded or modified in time to remedy the year issue or that the company s computer systems will not be disrupted upon the turn of the century 
any disruption of the company s business due to the year issue  whether caused by the company s systems or those of any of its suppliers  customers  banks  lenders  or insurers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year risks related to technology although the company s strategy includes significant investment in research and development of new and innovative products to meet technology advances  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in competing against new technologies developed by competitors 
risks related to adoption of the euro the new european currency the euro began being used by the eleven participating european countries january  although the united kingdom is not currently a euro country  the company s scottish subsidiary does a significant amount of business with euro countries 
management believes it has the necessary systems and business processes to deal with what is  in effect  one more foreign currency  but there can be no assurance that there will not be unforeseen economic effects of this change that might affect the company s sales or margins on business done with euro countries 
risks related to foreign operations for the period ended june   approximately of the company s sales were derived from foreign operations and  as of june   approximately of the company s net assets were located outside the united states 
foreign operations are subject to special risks that can materially affect the sales  profits  cash flows  and financial position of the company  including taxes and other restrictions on distributions and payments  currency exchange rate fluctuations  political and economic instability  inflation  minimum capital requirements  and exchange controls 
in particular  the company s brazilian operations  which constitute over half of the company s revenues from foreign operations  can be very volatile  changing from year to year due to the political situation and economy 
as a result  the future performance of the brazilian operations is inherently unpredictable 
see management s discussion sales regarding the recent devaluation of the brazilian currency 
risks related to cyclical nature of the industry the market for the company s products is subject to general economic conditions  including the level of capital spending by industrial companies 
as such  recessionary forces decrease demand for the company s products and adversely affect performance 
risks related to competition the company s business is subject to direct and indirect competition from both domestic and foreign firms 
in particular  low wage foreign sources have created severe competitive pricing pressures 
under certain circumstances  including significant changes in us and foreign currency relationships  such pricing pressures might reduce unit sales and or adversely affect the company s margins
