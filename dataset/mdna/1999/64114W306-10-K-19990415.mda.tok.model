item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations years ended december  and in  we evaluated our smart card business and determined that the cash requirements did not justify the continued operations of the development of such business in the increasingly competitive smart card market 
as a result  we sold our smart card division effective july  and we accounted for the operations of this division as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  references to our continuing operations which are discussed hereafter will relate to its behavioral health information systems business which represents our only business 
our revenue for was  an increase of  or  from the revenue which was  the largest component of revenue in was turnkey systems labor revenue which increased to  from  in  reflecting a increase

interest expense was  in  an increase of  or from the  in this increase was the result of higher borrowings during which were substantially off set by a reduction in the cost of borrowings 
the most significant component of the interest expense on an ongoing basis is the interest payable to our asset based lender 
we paid interest on such loans at a rate equal to prime plus plus a fee of of the face amount of the invoice for the first nine months of effective october   we amended the terms of our agreement with the asset based lender and reduced the interest rate from prime plus to prime plus and eliminated the fee previously paid on the face amount of each invoice 
the net loss from netsmart s discontinued operations  the smart card division  was  in  a decrease of  from the  in this decrease is the result of a reduction of expenses in this division prior to the sale of the division 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we generated a net income of  or

in  we incurred noncash compensation charges of million from our issuance of warrants and options having exercise prices which were below the market value of the common stock at the date of issuance 
during  we also issued  shares of common stock to certain noteholders and  shares of common stock to our asset based lender 
as a result of such issuance  we incurred a financing cost charge to operations of approximately million 
there were no such charges during during  we incurred product development expenses of  a decrease of from the  in these expenses were related to our behavioral health information systems products such as our clinician workstation  behavioral health information systems for windows  managed care and methadone dispensing products 
interest expense was  in  a decrease of  or  from the interest expense in this is a result of a decrease in the average borrowings during the most significant component of the interest expense on an ongoing basis is the interest payable to the our asset based lender 
during both years  we paid interest on such loans at a rate equal to prime plus plus a fee of of the face amount of the invoice 
related party administrative expense was  in and  in these charges were pursuant to an agreement with our principal stockholder to provide general business  management and financial consulting services for a monthly fee of  commencing in september  the month after we completed our initial public offering 
the loss from discontinued operations  the smart card division  was  in  and  in as a result of the foregoing factors  we incurred a loss of million  or per share  in as compared with a net loss of million  or per share  in liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of  at december   as compared to a working capital deficit of  at december  our cash position decreased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in working capital for the year ended december  was substantially due to the net income after adding back depreciation and amortization 
our principal source of funds  other than revenue  is an accounts receivable financing agreement with an asset based lender whereby we may borrow up to of eligible accounts receivable up to a maximum of  at december   the outstanding borrowings under this facility was  at december   the maximum amount available under this formula was  during the year  with the consent of the asset based lender  we have  from time to time exceeded the maximum borrowing level provided in the agreement with the asset based lender 
in order to expand and develop our business and perform our obligations under our agreements and purchase orders  we require substantial additional capital  and we have no commitments from any person to provide such capital 
our business may suffer significantly if we do not obtain the capital when it is required 
at december   accounts receivable and costs and estimated profits in excess of interim billings were approximately million  representing approximately days of revenue based on annualizing the revenue for the year ended december   although no assurance can be given that revenue will continue at the same level as the year ended december  accounts receivable at december  increased by million from million at december  to million at december  we believe that  with the elimination of expenses relating to the smart card business  the cash on hand  the increased line with our asset based lender together with revenue from the behavioral health information system business  it will be sufficient to enable us to continue to operate at least through the end of without additional funding 
if we continue to grow at the existing rate into and beyond  we may require significant additional funding 
we are therefore exploring various long term funding possibilities with several banks and investment banking organizations 
no assurances can be given as to the ability of netsmart to obtain additional financing and our inability to do so could have a material adverse affect on our ability to grow
