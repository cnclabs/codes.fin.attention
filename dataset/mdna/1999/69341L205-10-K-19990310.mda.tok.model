quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in the us prime interest rate  libor rate  or lender s cost of funds based on commercial paper market rates  would affect the rate at which the company could borrow funds under its various borrowing facilities 
increases in interest rates to the company  which may cause the company to raise the implicit rates charged to its customers  could in turn  result in a reduction in demand for the company s lease financing 
the company s warehouse credit facilities and senior secured notes are variable rate debt 
the company estimates a one percent increase or decrease in the company s variable rate debt would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million in  million in  million in  and  in the company estimates a two percent increase or decrease in the company s variable rate debt would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million in  million in  million in  and  in the company hedges borrowings under the nonrecourse securitization facility  effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings 
the company is currently required to hedge against the risk of interest rate increases for those leases used as collateral for its nonrecourse securitization facility  but the company generally does not enter into hedges for leases designated for sale to institutional programs  or for syndication  or for leases of transportation equipment 
such hedging activities may limit the company s ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio of leases  but may also protect the company from increases in interest rates for the hedged portfolio 
all of the company s other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates
