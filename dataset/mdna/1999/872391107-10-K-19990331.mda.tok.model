item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management managing interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of the company s current and future earnings as well as its capital to changes in the level of market interest rates 
the bank s exposure to interest rate risk results from  among other things  the difference in maturities in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
since the bank s assets currently have a longer maturity than its liabilities  the bank s earnings could be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates and conversely  positively impacted during a period of falling interest rates 
the relationship between the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities is continually monitored by management 
in this regard  the bank emphasizes the origination of shorter term or adjustable rate assets for portfolio while originating longer term fixed rate assets for resale 
at december   approximately of the bank s loan portfolio were comprised of loans with original maturities of less than years  balloon mortgages or adjustable rate loans 
additionally  the origination level of fixed rate assets are continually monitored and if deemed appropriate  the bank will enter into forward commitments for the sale of these assets to ensure the bank is not exposed to undue interest rate risk 
the bank utilizes its investment and mortgage backed security portfolio in managing its liquidity and therefore seeks securities with a stated or average estimated maturities of less than five years 
these securities are readily marketable and provide the bank with a cash flow stream to fund asset growth or liability maturities 
a significant portion of the bank s assets has been funded with cds including jumbo cds 
unlike other deposit products such as checking and savings accounts  cds carry a high degree of interest rate sensitivity and therefore  their renewal will vary based on the competitiveness of the bank s interest rates 
the bank has attempted to price its cds to be competitive at the shorter maturities ie  maturities of less than one year in order to better match the repricing characteristics of portfolio loans 
at december   approximately of the bank s deposits were cds 
the bank utilizes borrowings from the fhlb in managing its interest rate risk and as a tool to augment deposits in funding asset growth 
the bank may utilize these funding sources to better match its longer term repricing assets ie  between one and five years 
the nature of the bank s current operations is such that it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
additionally  neither the company nor the bank owns any trading assets 
at december   the bank did not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps  caps  or floors 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management 
however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
an additional analysis required by the ots and generated quarterly is the ots interest rate exposure report 
this report forecasts changes in the bank s market value of portfolio equity mvpe under alternative interest rate environments 
the mvpe is defined as the net present value of the bank s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in mvpe at december  are as follows mvpe amount change in interest rate in thousands change basis points  basis points  basis points  
basis points  flat rate  basis points  basis points  basis points  basis points  management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the vulnerability of the company s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on mvpe could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
in the event the bank should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in its mvpe subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate  it has a number of options which it could utilize to remedy such mismatch 
the bank could restructure its investment portfolio through sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or it could attract deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities
