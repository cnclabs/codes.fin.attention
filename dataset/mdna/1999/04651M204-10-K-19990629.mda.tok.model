item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  publishes  and distributes interactive entertainment for the children s education edutainment  leisure entertainment  and gaming enthusiast s markets for a variety of platforms 
the company employs a portfolio approach to achieve a broad base of published products across most major consumer software categories 
since it commenced operations in february  the company has experienced rapid growth and its product and customer mix has changed substantially 
publishing and distribution are the two major activities of the company 
publishing is divided into front line  leisure and children s publishing 
because each of these product categories has different associated costs  the company s margins have depended and will depend  in part  on the percentage of net revenues attributable to each category 
in addition  a particular product s margin may depend on whether it has been internally or externally developed and on what platforms it is published 
further  the company s margins may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of its new published product releases 
to the extent that mass merchants require greater proportions of third party software products  some of which may yield lower margins  the company s operating results may be impacted accordingly 
the worldwide interactive entertainment software market is comprised primarily of software for two distinct platforms pcs and dedicated game consoles 
the market has grown dramatically in recent years with its growth driven by the increasing installed base of multimedia pcs and current generation game console systems 
in addition  the development of enabling multimedia technologies  the proliferation of software titles  the development of new and expanding distribution channels and the emergence of a strong international market for interactive entertainment software have spurred the rapid expansion of the interactive entertainment market 
the company develops and publishes products for multiple platforms  and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of the company s strategy 
sales of the company s playstation  n  sega saturn and gameboy titles console titles increased from of the company s front line revenue during the year ended december  to in the year ended december   in the three months ended march  and in the twelve months ended march  fiscal 
since  the company has released approximately console titles 
as evidenced by the strong sales of these platforms  the company believes that significant growth opportunities exist across a variety of next generation hardware platforms  in particular playstation  for which the company continues to create software products 
there has been an increased rate of change and complexity in the technological innovations affecting the company s products  coupled with increased competitiveness for shelf space and buyer selectivity 
the market for frontline titles has become increasingly hit driven  which has led to higher production budgets  more complex development processes  longer development cycles and generally shorter product life cycles 
the importance of the timely release of hit titles  as well as the increased scope and complexity of the product development and production process  have increased the need for disciplined product development processes that limit cost and schedule overruns 
this in turn has increased the importance of leveraging the technologies  characters or story lines of such hit titles into additional interactive entertainment software products in order to spread development costs among multiple products 
in this environment  the company is determined to achieve a balance between development done by its own internal development studies and that done by third party developers 
along with its industry competitors  the company had historically capitalized royalties advanced to third party developers as a prepayment in current assets and evaluated the realization of these royalty advances on a quarterly basis 
the market changes noted above have made it extremely difficult to determine the likelihood of individual product acceptance and success 
as a result  in the quarter ended december   the company expensed royalty advances of million on products that were in development or on sale 
in connection with this change in the dynamics of the marketplace  the company changed its accounting  beginning on january   for future royalty advances  treating such costs as research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred 
multi year output advances will continue to be capitalized as royalty advances and expensed over the development periods  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the distribution channels for interactive software have changed significantly in recent years 
traditionally  consumer software was sold through specialty stores 
today  consumer software is increasingly sold through mass merchants such as wal mart  kmart and target  as well as major retailers  including office depot  best buy  compusa  aafes  sam s club and babbage s 
the internet and on line networks also present a new channel through which publishers and distributors can distribute their products to end users 
in  the company acquired wizardworks  a publisher of value priced interactive entertainment  edutainment and productivity software  formgen inc  a publisher of interactive pc shareware and software and humongous  a premier developer and publisher of original interactive children s software 
wizardworks  formgen and humongous collectively the acquired companies  have each been accounted for as a pooling of interests

a plan has also been developed  and is now being implemented  to remedy any deficiencies in the company s critical information systems 
the company is resolving year compliance issues primarily through normal upgrades of its software or  when necessary  through replacement of existing software or affected non it systems with year compliant applications or systems 
presently  the company is in the process of testing the enhancements to its critical information systems and is developing and implementing a plan to identify time sensitive components in its products currently under development 
in addition  the company is in the process of asking vendors and other third parties with whom the company has relevant relationships to certify that they are year compliant or  if they are not yet so compliant  to provide a description of their plans to become so 
the company expects to complete its programs for year compliance with respect to critical information systems and vendor and other third parties by september  and intends to complete such process with respect to its products in advance of january  there can be no assurance that such upgrades and replacements can be completed on schedule or within estimated costs or can successfully address the year compliance issues 
if the company s present efforts to address the year compliance issues are not successful  or if vendors and other third parties with which the company conducts business do not successfully address such issues  the company s business  operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
for example  failure to achieve year compliance for the company s internal critical information systems could delay its ability to manufacture and ship products  disrupt customer service and technical support facilities  or interrupt customer access to online products and services 
the company also relies heavily on third parties such as vendors  suppliers  service providers and a large retail distribution channel 
if these or other third parties experience year failures or malfunctions  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s ability to conduct ongoing operations 
for example  the ability to manufacture and ship products both the company s and third parties for which the company acts as distributor into the retail channel  to receive retail sales information necessary to maintain proper inventory levels  or to complete online transactions dependent upon third party service providers could be affected 
moreover  should third party products distributed by the company fail to be year compliant  retail customers of the company might return such products or seek redress from the company  which in turn would require the company to seek redress from the publisher of the product 
in addition  because of the number of products sold by the company currently and in the past  the company could face litigation relating to year compliance of products that the company no longer sells and or supports  although the company believes that any such exposure should not be material 
the company has budgeted million for the cost of upgrading  replacing  testing and implementing its year compliance  and has currently spent approximately million to date 
additionally  the company has not yet established a contingency plan and will continue to evaluate whether one is necessary  depending upon its progress in implementing its year compliance measures as set forth above 
the above discussion regarding costs  risks and estimated completion dates for the year is based on the company s best estimates given information that is currently available  and is subject to change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates
