item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during the three year period ended december   the company increased its revenue at a compounded annual growth rate of  as revenue increased to million in from million in a significant increase in fleet size to meet customer demand as well as an increase in the freight rates contributed to revenue growth over this period 
in addition to internal growth  the company completed four acquisitions during the three year period ended in august  the company acquired the customer relationships of trans roads  inc  a million annual revenue carrier based near atlanta  georgia 
in october  the company purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of bud meyer  a million annual revenue temperature controlled carrier based in lake city  minnesota 
in august  the company acquired certain assets of gouge trucking  inc  a million annual revenue carrier located in north carolina 
in october  the company purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of southern refrigerated transport  inc  a million annual revenue truckload carrier and tony smith trucking  inc  both located in southwest arkansas 
additionally  the company formed a new division  covenant transport logistics  in october the company intends to continue to grow both internally and through acquisitions  with the main constraint on internal growth being the ability to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of qualified drivers 
the company has increased net income approximately to million in from million in several factors contributed to the increase  including declining fuel prices and negotiating higher freight rates from substantially all customers 
although higher driver compensation partially offset the increased freight rates  management believes the company benefited from attracting and retaining more drivers 
changes in several operating statistics and expense categories are expected to result from actions the company has taken in and both bud meyer and srt operate predominately single driver tractors  as opposed to the primarily team driver tractor fleet operated by covenant s long haul  dry van operation 
the single driver fleets operate fewer miles per tractor and experience more empty miles 
the company s operating statistics and expenses are expected to shift in future periods with the mix of single  team  and temperature controlled operations 
the company also initiated the use of owner operators of tractors in and had contracted with approximately owner operators as of december  owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and bear all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed lease payment per mile 
in addition  the company does not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor 
in  the company also financed approximately tractors under operating leases 
in  the company financed an additional tractors and trailers under operating leases 
the lease payments to owner operators and the financing of tractors under operating leases appear as operating expenses under revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for owner operator tractors  driver compensation  fuel  communications  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from owner operators and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  the company intends to evaluate its efficiency using pretax margin and net margin rather than operating ratio

during  the company began using owner operators of revenue equipment  who provide a tractor and driver and cover all of their operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
accordingly  expenses such as driver salaries  fuel  repairs  depreciation  and interest normally associated with company owned equipment are consolidated in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation when owner operators are utilized 
the company had contracted with approximately owner operator at december  in the fourth quarter of  the company also entered into a sale and leaseback of tractors  which will increase this expense in the future  while reducing depreciation and interest 
repairs increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  repairs increased in from in the increase was attributable to an increase in fleet size  a slight increase in fleet age  and to repairs made to improve the condition of equipment prior to sales and trades of older equipment acquired in the bud meyer transaction

as a result of the foregoing  the company s pretax margin improved to in from in the company s effective tax rate was in and in as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million  to million in of revenue from million in of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required significant investments in new revenue equipment 
the company historically has financed its revenue equipment requirements with borrowings under a line of credit  cash flows from operations  long term operating leases  and a small portion with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers 
the company s primary sources of liquidity at december  were funds provided by operations  borrowings under its primary credit agreement  which had maximum available borrowing of million at december  the credit agreement and the proceeds from a stock offering that closed may the company believes its sources of liquidity are adequate to meet its current and projected needs 
the company s primary sources of cash flow from operations in were net income increased by depreciation and amortization  and deferred income taxes 
the most significant use of cash provided by operations were to fund prepaid expenses primarily license plates for revenue equipment and to finance increases in receivables and advances associated with growth in the business 
the company s number of days sales in accounts receivable increased from days in to days in net cash provided by operating activities was million in and million in the decrease resulted from higher receivables associated with a billing delay caused by the company s imaging system which has since been corrected 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in such amounts were used primarily to acquire additional revenue equipment as the company expanded its operations 
in addition  approximately million represented the purchase price for the assets of gouge trucking  inc of which approximately  was allocated to goodwill and covenants not to compete  and approximately million represented the purchase price for the acquisition of srt of which approximately million was allocated to goodwill 
the company expects capital expenditures primarily for revenue equipment  net of trade ins  to be approximately million in exclusive of acquisitions 
the company sold  shares of class a common stock and certain stockholders of the company sold  shares in a public offering that closed in may the company received net proceeds of million in connection with the offering 
the proceeds were used to reduce the company s indebtedness under the revolving line of credit 
the indebtedness was incurred primarily to acquire revenue equipment

net cash provided by financing activities was million in and was related primarily to proceeds from the sale of company shares as well borrowings under the credit agreement 
this compared with net cash used in financing activities of million in at december   the company had outstanding debt of million  primarily consisting of million drawn under the credit agreement  million in year senior notes  million in term equipment financing  million interest bearing note to the former primary stockholder of srt related to the acquisition and million in notes related to non compete agreements 
interest rates on this debt range to 
the credit agreement is with a group of banks and has a maximum borrowing limit of million 
borrowings related to revenue equipment are limited to the lesser of of net book value of revenue equipment or million 
working capital borrowings are limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
letters of credit are limited to an aggregate commitment of million 
the credit agreement includes a security agreement such that the credit agreement may be collateralized by virtually all assets of the company if a covenant violation occurs 
a commitment fee of 
per annum is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
the company  including all subsidiaries  are parties to the credit agreement and related documents 
the credit agreement revolves for two years and then has a four year term out if not renewed 
payments for interest are due quarterly in arrears with principal payments due in equal quarterly installments beginning on the second anniversary date of the credit agreement or any renewal 
the company renewed the loan in december and anticipates renewing the credit agreement on an annual basis 
borrowings under the credit agreement are based on the banks base rate or libor and accrue interest based on one  two  or three month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on cash flow coverage 
at december   the margin was 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the interest rate on million of borrowing under the credit agreement at rates between and plus applicable margin 
the swaps expire between february  and october  in december  the company engaged in a sale and leaseback transaction involving of the company s tractors that had been newly acquired or were awaiting delivery 
the proceeds of the sale were used to reduce debt under the credit agreement 
the company entered into a three year lease of the equipment  with a implied interest rate and a residual value guaranteed by the company at a level equal to the company s salvage value on owned tractors 
the company s headquarters facility was completed in december  the cost of the approximately acres and construction of the headquarters and shop buildings was approximately million 
the company financed the land and improvements under a build to suit operating lease 
the credit agreement  senior notes  and the headquarters and terminal lease agreement contain certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness 
all of these instruments are cross defaulted 
the company was in compliance with the agreements at december  inflation and fuel costs most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
fuel expense comprises a larger percentage of revenue for covenant than many other carriers because of covenant s long average length of haul 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
at december   approximately of the total purchases of fuel by the company were subject to hedging contracts 
in march  the percentage will decrease to approximately and will be in effect for the remainder of unless further action is taken by the company 
may contain forward looking statements 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather creating more equipment repairs 
first quarter net income historically has been lower than net income in each of the other three quarters of the year because of the weather 
the company s equipment utilization typically improves substantially between may and october of each year because of the trucking industry s seasonal shortage of equipment on traffic originating in california and the company s ability to satisfy some of that requirement 
the seasonal shortage typically occurs between may and august because california produce carriers equipment is fully utilized for produce during those months and does not compete for shipments hauled by the company s dry van operation 
during september and october  business increases as a result of increased retail merchandise shipped in anticipation of the holidays 
the table below sets forth quarterly information reflecting the company s equipment utilization miles per tractor per period during  and the company believes that equipment utilization more accurately demonstrates the seasonality of its business than changes in revenue  which are affected by the timing of deliveries of new revenue equipment 
the results in also were affected by the acquisition of bud meyer and srt  which operate primarily single driver fleets and thus generate fewer miles per tractor 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter year the year yk issue concerns the inability of computer systems to recognize and process date sensitive information after due to the use of only the last two digits to refer to a year 
this problem could affect both information systems software and hardware and other equipment that relies on microprocessors 
management has completed a company wide evaluation of this impact on its computer systems  applications  and other date sensitive equipment and has hired a nationally recognized consulting firm to perform a status study of the company s processes and activities related to the company s yk project 
all known remediation efforts and testing of systems equipment are expected to be completed by july  the cost of the assessment and remediation efforts for the modifications and updates to existing software is estimated to be approximately  the company is also in the process of monitoring the progress of material third parties  including shippers and suppliers  in their efforts to become yk compliant and expects this project to be completed by july the company s primary information technology systems it systems include hardware and software for billing  dispatch  edi  fueling  payroll  telephone  vehicle maintenance  inventory  and satellite communications systems 
the majority of the company s it systems are purchased from and maintained by third parties 
a primary it system designed by a third party is the satellite tracking system  which tracks equipment locations  provides dispatch and routing information  and allows in cab communications with drivers 
the company s operating system that manages payroll  billing  and dispatch has been purchased from the supplier in march on a long term lease 
the company s financial reporting system is provided by a third party 
the company has been informed by the providers of these systems that they are yk compliant 
another significant it system provided by a third party transmits payroll funds to drivers and allows drivers to purchase fuel and other items outside the company s terminal locations 
the company has been informed by this provider that it expects to be yk compliant by june although the company believes it is yk compliant in its edi applications  the company has not completed its review of yk compliance of edi applications of its shippers 
may contain forward looking statements 
the company has reviewed its risks associated with microprocessors embedded in facilities and equipment non it systems 
the primary non it systems includes microprocessors in tractor engines and other components  terminal facilities  satellite communications units  and telecommunications and other office equipment 
the company s assessment of its revenue equipment  satellite communications units  and office equipment non it systems has revealed low risk of material replacement requirements 
such equipment is relatively new and was designed to be yk compliant 
the company is continuing to assess its non it systems in its terminal facilities but believes that the risk of a service interrupting failure in these systems is low 
the company could be faced with severe consequences if yk issues are not identified and resolved in a timely manner by the company and material third parties 
the company s primary risk relating to yk compliance is the possibility of service disruption from third party suppliers of satellite communications  telephone  fueling  and financial services 
a worst case scenario would result in the short term inability of the company to deliver freight for its shippers 
this would result in lost revenues  however  the amount would be dependent on the length and nature of the disruption  which cannot be predicted or estimated 
the company is in the process of developing contingency plans in case business interruptions do occur 
management expects plans to be completed by june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in i certain commodity prices and ii certain interest rates on its debts 
commodity price risk prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are generally outside the company s control 
accordingly  the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable 
because the company s operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
for  diesel fuel expenses represented of the company s total operating expenses 
based upon the company s fuel consumption  a ten percent increase in the average annual price per gallon of diesel fuel would increase the company s annual diesel fuel expense by million before considering the effect of fuel hedging 
the company uses derivative instruments  including purchased commitments through supplier  to reduce a portion of its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
at december   the notional amount for purchased commitments during was million gallons 
net unrealized losses were approximately million 
at december   the national average price of diesel fuel as provided by the us department of energy was per gallon 
at december   a ten percent change in fuel prices would impact net unrealized losses by approximately million 
interest rate risk the credit agreement  provided there has been no default  carries a maximum variable interest rate of libor for the corresponding period plus 
at december   the company had drawn million under the credit agreement 
approximately million was subject to variable rates and the remaining million was subject to interest rate swaps that fixed the interest rates at and plus applicable margin per annum 
the swaps expire between february  and october  assuming the december  variable rate borrowings  each one percentage point increase in libor would increase the company s pretax interest expense by  the company does not trade in these derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  nor does it trade in these instruments when there are no underlying transaction related exposures
