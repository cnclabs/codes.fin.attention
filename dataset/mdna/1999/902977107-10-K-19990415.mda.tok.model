item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements certain information contained in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
although the company believes that expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved 
forward looking information is subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual result s to differ materially from those projected 
such risks  trends and uncertainties include the highly cyclical nature of the forest products industry  general economic conditions  competition  price conditions or trends for the company s products  the possibility that timber supply could increase if governmental  environmental or endangered species policies change  and limitations on the company s ability to harvest its timber due to adverse natural conditions or increased governmental restrictions 
the results of the company s operations and its ability to pay quarterly distributions to its unitholders depend upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond its control 
these factors include general economic and industry conditions  domestic and export prices  supply and demand for logs  seasonality  government regulations affecting the manner in which timber may be harvested  and competition from other supplying regions and substitute products 
these and other risks are described in the company s other reports and registration statements  which are available from the united states securities and exchange commission 
general the basis of presentation of the company s financial statements is described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the comparability of the financial results of the company and the predecessor is primarily affected by i increased revenues resulting from increased harvest levels on the klamath falls timberlands  ii revenues realized from harvesting on the ochoco timberlands acquired by the company in july  iii increased depletion charges resulting from the step up in asset values of the timberlands  iv reduced per mbf logging and hauling costs resulting from the use of independent contractors rather than company employees to conduct silvicultural activities and the harvesting and delivery of logs due to lower hourly wage rates  the elimination of compensation payments during seasonal down time and the reduction in associated capital costs and v a different customer base  as a majority of the predecessor s sales were to an affiliated customer at internally established transfer prices whereas all of the company s sales are to unaffiliated conversion facilities at market based prices although whether the transfer prices or market based prices were higher changed from time to time 
supply and demand factors the company s results of operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond its control  including general industry conditions  domestic and international prices and supply and demand for logs  lumber and other wood products  seasonality and competition from other domestic and international supplying regions and substitute products 
supply the supply of logs available for purchase has been most affected in recent years by significant reductions in timber harvested from public timberlands  principally as a result of efforts to preserve the habitat of certain endangered species  as well as a change in the emphasis of government policy toward habitat preservation  conservation and recreation and away from timber management 
since the early s  environmental and other similar concerns and governmental policies have substantially reduced the volume of timber under contract to be harvested from public lands 
the pace of regulatory activity accelerated in the late s 
the resulting supply decrease caused prices for logs to increase significantly  reaching peak levels during although prices have declined from these record levels  current prices still exceed pre levels 
the low supply of timber from public lands  which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future  has benefitted private timber holders such as the company through higher stumpage and log prices 
industry participants do not expect environmental restrictions to ease materially within any reasonable planning horizon 
consequently  many producers of lumber and wood products are attempting to adapt to the new supply environment by increasing their emphasis on raw material yields  entering into long term timber supply arrangements and value added manufacturing  and accessing previously untapped supplies such as private wood lot owners  timber with difficult access  alternative species and imports 
these factors have tended to restrict prices from even greater increases 
while raw material supply is expected to be an ongoing challenge for the lumber and wood products industry  such conditions are likely to cause the favorable operating environment for timber owners such as the company to continue for the foreseeable future 
in response to an increase in timber prices in the early s  imports of logs and lumber from abroad from countries such as canada and new zealand increased 
these imports  however  only partially offset the lost volume of timber from public timberlands and did not replace the mature  high quality timber found in greater quantities on public timberlands 
since  imports have decreased and their current impact on timber prices is minimal 
demand changes in general economic and demographic factors  including the strength of the economy and interest rates for home mortgages and construction loans  have historically caused fluctuations in housing starts and  in turn  demand and prices for lumber and commodity wood products 
with the growth of the home center distribution business  the repair and remodeling markets have become a significant factor in terms of the demand for lumber and commodity wood products and have dampened the wide fluctuations that occurred when new housing starts were the primary factor 
a large portion of the company s property consists of pine species  which are used in the finishing market  for molding trim  doors and windows 
this market is more affected by repair and remodeling than new housing construction 
prices for these species  primarily ponderosa pine  reached a peak in the spring of and as a result attracted imports of radiata pine from new zealand and chile 
the market absorbed these relatively small quantities with little impact on prices 
the demand for logs in the united states is also affected by the level of lumber imports 
in response to increasing lumber imports from canada  the united states and canada signed an agreement in which restricts the availability of canadian softwood lumber in the united states 
the company believes that this agreement has not had a material impact on the price or demand for logs in the united states although its long term effect is uncertain 
due to transportation costs  domestic conversion facilities in the pacific northwest tend to purchase raw materials within relatively confined geographic areas  generally within a mile radius 
the conversion facilities in the vicinity of the timberlands need more wood supply to run at capacity than can be produced by nearby timberlands 
as a result  the demand from this region is relatively steady  although prices fluctuate with market conditions 
current market conditions low mortgage interest rates have created favorable conditions for new home construction  home repair and remodeling  and industrial and other construction  which has strengthened the demand for the company s logs and timber 
however  as the result of weak log markets in asia  the supply of logs has increased on the west coast 
combined with the continued heavy importing of lumber from canada  this has put downward pressure on prices for the company s logs and timber during most of the key lumber price indicators for ponderosa pine dropped from mid to the end of ponderosa pine indicators for remained at historically low levels and continued to decline throughout the year for a reduction 
lodgepole pine prices experienced a decline of in douglas fir prices were consistently lower in from levels  with an average year to year reduction of 
in contrast  prices for white fir were generally higher in than in by  with significant increases in the second half of strong demand for panel products manufactured from this species persisted through the second half and the company benefitted from the demand by shifting more production to white fir logs to improve the overall mix 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth sales volume for each of and from the sale of logs  stumpage and timber deeds by thousand board feet and price per thousand board feet and the sales of property 
sales volume mbf price realization mbf timber timber property period logs stumpage deeds logs stumpage deeds sales s year ended    th quarter   rd quarter   nd quarter    st quarter   year ended     th quarter    rd quarter   nd quarter   st quarter   revenues 
revenues were million in  a decrease of million or from revenues of million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in timber and property sales  a million reduction in log sales and a million reduction in by products and other revenues  partially offset by a million increase in revenues from stumpage sales 
to meet its working capital requirements  the company harvested and sold logs and stumpage in at rates in excess of both levels and the general partner s estimate of the long term sustainable annual harvest level for its current timberlands of approximately  mbf per year 
revenue from planned timber and property sales decreased to million in from million during  representing a million or reduction 
the significant reduction was due to a decrease in the volume contained in the timber and property sales of  mbf as compared to  mbf in log sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared to log sales of million on volumes of  mbf in the average log sales price per mbf for was compared to an average log sales price per mbf of for  a reduction  reflecting weaker markets  primarily for ponderosa pine logs 
stumpage sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared with stumpage sales of million on volumes of  mbf in the average stumpage sales price per mbf for was compared to an average stumpage sales price per mbf of for  a reduction 
the decrease in average stumpage sales prices from to was primarily due to a reduction in the grade of timber harvested from the ochoco timberlands 
in addition  the company entered into six stumpage contracts in for an aggregate estimated revenue of million and  mbf 
it is expected that such timber will be removed  and revenue recognized  during  under such contracts 
operating costs 
results for reflect a full year s ownership of the ochoco timberlands whereas results include such ownership from the date of acquisition on july  operating costs were million in  an increase of million or over operating costs of million in this increase was the result of a million increase in depletion  depreciation and road amortization dd a expense and a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses partially offset by a million decrease in cost of timber and property sales and a million decrease in cost of products sold 
dd a expense was million in  a million or increase over dd a expense of million in this increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in log and stumpage sales volumes and an increase in the company s depletion rate per mbf  which resulted from the ochoco timberlands acquisition in july selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  an increase of million or over comparable expenses of million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to one time expenses of million related to severance costs and the repurchase of member interests in the general partner that were incurred in the first and fourth quarters of  combined with increased costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company  and implementing the company s strategy to pursue accretive acquisitions of timberland 
the reduction in the cost basis of the timber and property sales between and is due to the reduced volume contained in the sale as compared to the sales  as previously mentioned 
cost of products sold was million for as compared to million for  a million or reduction 
the decrease in cost of products sold was the result of a million decrease in logging costs  a million decrease in wood fiber processing costs and a million decrease in silviculture expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million as compared to million for  representing a million or reduction 
interest expense was incurred primarily on the million of notes issued in the november public note offering 
interest expense related primarily to million of term debt and million of revolving debt incurred in connection with the weyerhaeuser acquisition on august  and million of incremental debt incurred in connection with the ochoco acquisition on july  the reduction in interest expense is primarily attributable to the use of a substantial portion of the proceeds from the company s initial offering completed on november   to retire outstanding debt 
amortization of deferred financing fees and debt guarantee fees 
the company deferred million of fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes 
these fees will be amortized over the term of the notes  which are due in november the amortization of these fees during was million 
during the company recognized million of expense related to debt guarantee fees and amortization of deferred financing fees 
interest income 
interest income for was million  a decrease of million or from interest income for of million 
the reduction in interest income is primarily attributable to the reduction in the cash and cash equivalents available in compared to other expense  net 
other expense  net was million for compared to million for  representing a reduction of million or 
extraordinary items 
during the company refinanced certain long term borrowings resulting in extraordinary losses on extinguishment of debt of million due to the write off of existing unamortized deferred financing fees and other related fees 
cash flow from operations 
during  cash flow from operations decreased million or primarily as a result of decreased proceeds from timber and property sales  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and a decrease of advance payments on stumpage sales contracts 
partners capital during the limited partner interest in the company declined million from million to million 
this decline is the result of the limited partner s share of the company s net loss and distributions to unitholders during  which were million and million  respectively 
the general partner interest in the company also declined during reflecting its share of the company s net loss and distributions for the company currently expects to continue to incur operating losses and make distributions to its unitholders 
as a result  the company anticipates that partners capital will continue to decline 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the results of operations for the year ended december  are based on combining the periods of january  through august  the period prior to the weyerhaeuser acquisition and august  through december  both as shown in the historical financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the principal effect of the weyerhaeuser acquisition in was an increase in depletion  depreciation and road amortization expense due to a higher cost basis for the company s timber  timberlands and logging roads and interest expense due to borrowings to finance the weyerhaeuser acquisition 
revenues 
revenues in were million  an increase of over revenues of million in this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in revenues from log and stumpage sales and a million increase in timber and property sales  partially offset by a decrease of million in by products and other revenues 
log and stumpage sales volumes in were  mbf  an increase of over log and stumpage sales volumes of  mbf in the significant increase in the volume harvested was mainly due to the company s aggressive harvest plan compared to that of the predecessor for the first eight months of  as well as the commencement of log and stumpage sales from the ochoco timberlands which were acquired on july  average log and stumpage prices increased by  from per mbf in to per mbf in  primarily due to a larger proportion of higher valued timber harvested from the ochoco timberlands during the last half of revenues from timber and property sales were million during there were no such timber or property sales during the reduction in by products and other revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in the volume of fiber sold for use as chips 
due to low demand in the pulp and paper industry  chip prices had decreased to a level where it was no longer profitable for the company to process residual fiber for use as chips for much of demand for these chips  however  increased in the last quarter of operating costs 
operating costs were million in  an increase of over operating costs of million in this increase was the result of a million increase in cost of products sold  an million increase in the cost of timber and property sales and a million increase in dd a expense 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in cost of products sold was primarily the result of a million increase in logging costs and a million increase in severance taxes 
partially offsetting these increases were a million decrease in wood fiber processing costs and a million decrease in outside log purchases 
logging costs and severance taxes increased primarily as a result of a increase in the level of merchantable grade logs harvested and sold  partially offset by a decrease in the company s logging cost per mbf 
the decrease in the company s logging cost per mbf was primarily the result of the company s changing from a mix of internal logging crews and outside contractors during the first eight months of to the use of outside contractors for all its logging operations during the last four months of and in wood fiber processing costs decreased by as a result of a decrease in the volume of fiber processed and sold as chips and a write down to fiber log inventories during  resulting from a decline in chip prices during the period 
during  the company had timber and property sales with a combined cost basis of million 
no sales of tracts of timber or property were made during dd a expense was million in  a million increase over dd a expense of million in this increase was primarily due to the significant increase in the company s depletion rate combined with the large increase in the volume of logs harvested and sold as previously mentioned 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily the result of the step up in asset values of the klamath falls timberlands upon their acquisition from weyerhaeuser 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of from comparable expenses of million in this decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of million in one time payments for advisory services paid to affiliates of the company in connection with the weyerhaeuser acquisition and million of one time management fees paid to an affiliate of the company for management services in the advisory fees were incurred in connection with the weyerhaeuser acquisition and its initial financing 
the management fee generally relates to services rendered in connection with the initial formation of ustk and old services 
primarily offsetting these advisory and management fees were increases in salaries and wages as well as professional fees resulting from the company operating as an independent entity rather than as a division of weyerhaeuser 
interest expense 
interest expense was million during and primarily related to million of term debt and million of revolving debt incurred in connection with the weyerhaeuser acquisition in august and million of incremental debt incurred in connection with the ochoco acquisition on july  the company refinanced million of its existing debt on november  by issuing the notes in the public note offering and paid down the remaining million of outstanding debt between july  and december  with the proceeds from the initial offering and cash flows from operating activities 
the company incurred million in interest expense during the last four months of there was no interest expense and no debt outstanding during the first eight months of  as the predecessor participated in weyerhaeuser s centralized cash management system 
amortization of deferred financing fees and debt guarantee fees 
the company deferred million of fees incurred in connection with the financing of the weyerhaeuser acquisition 
the company deferred million of fees in connection with the financing of the ochoco acquisition and related term debt refinancing 
these costs were being amortized over the life of the debt 
the company deferred million of fees incurred in connection with the issuance of million of notes in the public note offering 
the company also incurred million of debt guarantee fees from august  through the extinguishment of the million of debt guaranteed by weyerhaeuser on november  the amortization of deferred financing fees and debt guarantee fee expense during and were million and million  respectively 
there was no deferred financing fee amortization or debt guarantee fee expense during the first eight months of interest income 
interest income was million during for the last four months of  there was million in interest income 
there was no interest income during the first eight months of  as the predecessor participated in weyerhaeuser s centralized cash management system 
other expense  net 
other expense  net changed from approximately zero in to million in other expense  net in primarily represents a million charge related to an unrealized loss on an unhedged financial instrument as of december  extraordinary items 
the company refinanced certain long term borrowings during resulting in extraordinary losses on extinguishment of debt of million due to the write off of existing unamortized deferred financing fees and other related fees 
liquidity and capital resources effective november   the company completed its initial offering of  common units including common units issued upon the exercise by the underwriter s of their over allotment option in december 
net proceeds from the initial offering were million 
in addition  the operating company issued million of notes in the public notes offering 
the proceeds from the initial offering and the public notes offering were primarily utilized to retire all outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million of term debt 
for purposes of this discussion  these transactions are hereafter referred to as the transactions 
as of december   the company has a cash balance of million and million of working capital 
operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were million  as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million in the million decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to a million decrease in the proceeds from timber and property sales  million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and million decrease of advance deposits on stumpage sales contracts 
the decrease in operating cash flows was partially offset by a substantial decrease in interest and debt guarantee fees in as compared to  of million and million  respectively 
investing activities 
cash flows provided by investing activities were million in  as compared to cash flows used by investing activities of million during during  a million receivable from a customer was paid and million was used in timber and road additions and orchard and nursery operations 
during  million was used in the ochoco acquisition and a million receivable from an affiliate was repaid 
financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in  as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million during during  the company paid million in distributions to unitholders and minority interest and paid million to an affiliate for redemption of a certain member s interest 
during  the company refinanced million of long term debt incurred in connection with the weyerhaeuser acquisition and incurred an additional million of long term debt in connection with the ochoco acquisition 
the company incurred million of deferred financing fees in connection with the refinancing of long term debt and the incurrence of financing for the ochoco acquisition 
in addition  the company distributed million to a member related to his estimated tax liability 
the company received million in net proceeds from the initial offering and million in proceeds  net of financing fees related to the issuance of the notes 
notes on november   the operating company issued million aggregate principal amount of notes the notes representing unsecured general obligations of the operating company which bear interest at per annum  payable semiannually in arrears on may and november the notes mature on november  unless previously redeemed 
the notes will not require any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments prior to maturity and are redeemable at the option of the operating company in whole or in part  on or after november  at predetermined redemption prices plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
in addition  at any time on or prior to november   the operating company  at its option  may redeem the notes with the net cash proceeds of a common units offering or other equity interests of the company  at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date  provided that at least of the principal amount of the notes originally issued remain outstanding immediately following such redemption 
upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as defined in the indenture  the company must offer to purchase the notes  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
the indenture governing the notes the indenture contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants applicable to the operating company and its subsidiaries  including limitations on the ability of the operating company and its subsidiaries to  among other things  i incur additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness unless the operating company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is greater than to  and ii make distributions to the company  make investments other than permitted investments in any person  create liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  suffer to exist any restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to make distributions or repay indebtedness to the company  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  enter into a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets  sell assets or harvest timber in excess of certain limitations which limitations are similar to those for the bank credit facility or engage in a different line of business 
under the indenture  the operating company will be permitted to make cash distributions to the company so long as no default or event of default exists or would exist upon making such distribution a if the operating company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is greater than to  in an amount  in any quarter  equal to available cash as defined in the indenture for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter or b if the operating company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is equal to or less than to  in an aggregate amount after the closing of this offering not to exceed i million less the aggregate of all restricted payments made under this clause b i during the immediately preceding fiscal quarters or shorter period  if applicable  beginning on the issue date of the notes  plus ii the net proceeds of certain capital contributions including the sale of units received by the company 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  and bank credit facility simultaneously with the closing of the initial offering  the company obtained the bank credit facility  which consists of the million acquisition facility and the million working capital facility 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility bears interest at the lower of the bank s prime rate plus a margin of at december  or libor plus a margin of at december  
the working capital facility expires on november  and all amounts borrowed thereunder shall then be due and payable 
at november   the company may elect to amortize any outstanding loans under the acquisition facility in sixteen equal quarterly installments beginning one quarter after the conversion to a term loan  subject to certain provisions contained in the agreement governing the bank credit facility 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with certain covenants of the bank credit facility 
on february   the required majority of the banks comprising the lending group waived such noncompliance 
in exchange for the waiver  the company agreed that future borrowings in excess of million will require the consent of a majority of the lending group members 
on april   the company advised the agent bank that  as of march   the company may be in violation of the minimum asset value to funded debt covenant the mavfd covenant contained in the credit agreement  which is based upon values set by the california state board of equalization sbe 
the banks have agreed to modify the mavfd covenant  effective march   to provide that the asset value shall be based upon the fair market value of the company s merchantable timber as set forth in the company s annual timber report  which management believes more accurately reflects the value of the company s properties 
as modified  the company is in compliance with such covenant 
in connection with the modification  the company agreed to terminate the working capital loan agreement as of june  and to terminate the acquisition facility  effective april  as of march   there was million outstanding under the working capital facility 
the company is currently is in discussions with several of the banks to continue the working capital facility  and one of them has agreed to act as agent bank 
in the interim  an affiliate of the general partner has agreed to make available to the company  from time to time  loans of up to million with terms and covenants substantially consistent with the current bank credit facility 
in addition  the company s plan is to engage investment banks to assist it in raising money for acquisitions 
the bank credit facility contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants applicable to the operating company  including limitations on the ability of the operating company to  among other things  i incur certain additional indebtedness  ii incur any liens other than a liens on accounts receivable and inventory to secure indebtedness under a refinancing facility for the working capital facility and b liens for purchase money financing of acquired assets up to an aggregate million  iii sell assets or harvest timber in excess of certain limitations which limitations are similar to those under the indenture and iv make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  and enter into a merger  consolidation or sale of assets 
the bank credit facility requires that the operating company maintain at all times the following financial ratios i minimum pro forma ebitdda as defined in the bank credit facility to pro forma interest expense as defined in the bank credit facility calculated on a four quarter rolling basis of to through june  and increasing to to thereafter  ii maximum funded debt as defined in the bank credit facility to pro forma ebitdda as defined in the bank credit facility of not more than to calculated on a four quarter rolling basis through june   and reducing to to thereafter and iii minimum asset value as defined in the bank credit facility to funded debt ratio as defined in the bank credit facility of measured on a quarterly basis based on quarter end numbers 
under bank credit facility  the company s average annual harvest volume over any period of four consecutive years cannot exceed mmbf as adjusted for timberland sales and purchases 
the agreements also limit one year harvest levels and average annual harvest levels for consecutive two and three year periods 
under the bank credit facility  so long as no event of default as defined in the bank credit facility exists or would result  the operating company will be permitted to make quarterly cash distributions to the company in an amount not to exceed available cash as defined in the bank credit facility in the preceding quarterly period 
available cash shall reflect a reserve equal to of the interest projected to be paid on the notes in the next succeeding quarter  as well as of the aggregate amount of all accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the bank credit facility on the date of determination 
in addition  in the third  second and first quarters preceding a quarter in which a scheduled principal payment is to be made on the notes  available cash will be required to reflect a reserve equal to  and  respectively  of the principal amount to be repaid on such date 
the bank credit facility also requires available cash to reflect a reserve for certain net proceeds from asset sales and excess harvests pending reinvestment 
capital expenditures cash distributions capital expenditures in totaled million 
capital expenditures incurred were mainly in the nature of land management silvicultural expenses  miscellaneous equipment and computer hardware and software 
capital expenditures were financed through cash flow generated by operations 
as the company does not currently own and does not plan to own manufacturing facilities  and all logging is subcontracted to third parties  it is anticipated that capital expenditures in the future will not be material and will consist mainly of land management silvicultural expenditures 
it is not currently anticipated that the company will either maintain log inventories  although small log inventories may be maintained for a short period of time  or incur material capital expenditures for machinery and equipment 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures will be approximately million in capital expenditures will consist primarily of capitalized silvicultural costs and miscellaneous equipment purchases 
cash required to meet the company s quarterly cash distributions  and interest and principal payments on indebtedness will be significant 
the general partner expects that the debt service will be funded from current operations 
the company currently expects to make cash distributions from current funds and cash generated from operations 
given projected harvest levels  the long term sustainable harvest levels of the timberlands and the harvest restrictions in the notes and bank credit facility  unless prices improve  costs are reduced  new markets are developed or the company makes accretive acquisitions  the company s ability in the future to make distributions at current levels may be adversely affected 
the company continues to evaluate means to improve cash flows  including the factors mentioned above 
however  there can be no assurance that prices will improve or that the company will be able to take any of these actions 
effects of inflation prices for the company s stumpage and logs may be subject to sharp cyclical fluctuations due to market or other economic conditions  including the level of construction activity but generally do not directly follow inflationary trends 
costs of forest operations and general and administrative expenses generally reflect inflationary trends 
year compliance the company is aware of the year issue associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year issue is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of a two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize data sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
since early  the company has been assessing its computer hardware and information systems needs and upgrading its systems as appropriate 
in the company completed the installation of several major hardware and software upgrades general ledger  accounts payable  accounts receivable  log accounting and telecommunications 
along with this assessment and upgrade of its systems  the company is also reviewing its systems and applications to ensure its computer and information systems will function properly at year the company anticipates completing this internal assessment by june  at this time  management of the company believes that the specific cost of achieving year compliance for its current systems will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
like other companies  the company relies on its customers for revenues and on its vendors for products and services of all kinds  these third parties all face the year issue 
an interruption in the ability of any of them to provide goods or services  or to pay for goods and services provided to them  or an interruption in the business operations of customers causing a decline in demand for services  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  there is a risk  the probability of which the company is not in a position to estimate  that the year will cause wholesale  perhaps prolonged  failures of electrical generation  banking  telecommunications or transportation systems in the united states or abroad  disrupting the general infrastructure of the economy 
the effect of such disruptions on the company could be material 
the company is in the process of identifying and surveying its key vendors and customers regarding their progress on the year issue 
the company s efforts to determine the readiness of its key vendors and customers are expected to be ongoing through year end however  because so many entities are exposed to the risk of failure not only of their own systems  but the systems of other entities  the ultimate effect of the year issue is subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the company believes that its preparations currently underway are adequate to access and manage the risks presented by the year issue  and does not have a formal contingency plan at this time 
the statements in this section regarding the year and the company s responses to it are forward looking statements 
they are based on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable in light of its current knowledge and experience 
a number of events could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements made on behalf of the company 
sfas no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financing accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
by january  the company believes that adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the company
