as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales represented during fiscal year  compared to during fiscal year during the first three quarters of fiscal year  cost of sales was slightly higher than the prior fiscal year  due to the imports of fertile egg and chicken parts 
these imports  that took place during the months of january through june of were a consequence of the low technical yields and high temperatures that were caused by the el nino weather phenomenon 
the impact of these imports was strong  not only in cost  but also technical yields as well 
during the months of july to september   the company ceased imports and as a result  its technical yields and cost of sales percentage improved 
since as de oros has been incorporated into the company  management decided to change the breed of its reproduction hens in order to improve production yields 
this change in breeders  that temporarily affected the incubation rates  has been stabilized into normal yields during the fourth quarter of fiscal this has resulted in weight gain and improved conversion amount of feed per pound of grown meat

labor costs remained relatively constant 
el nino phenomenon the el nino weather phenomenon directly affected the percentage of cost of sales over net sales for fiscal when mortality rates increased in the reproduction and broiler divisions  the company s fertile egg incubation rate goal only reached of hatchery capacity  consequently  the available amount of baby chicks for growing and processing was less than projected  causing a shortage of chicken pounds for sale 
to satisfy demand  it was necessary to import baby chicks for the broiler or growth phase  leading to higher costs 
this situation increased unit prices and also affected the incubation rates 
the goal for fiscal was an incubation rate  and the company achieved 
the ideal mortality rate standard for birds in their growing phase is  and the company experienced average mortality during fiscal as the new regulated and controlled environments are implemented among the different farms  management expects the mortality rates to decrease almost immediately 
when implemented in the company s experimental farms  mortality in the growing phase broiler chicken decreased from to  or a improvement 
in the reproduction phase  the results were a decrease in mortality from to in august  a improvement 
management expects to be able to offset the effects of el nino throughout fiscal year management decided to change the breeding of its reproduction hens in order to have breeds with more weight with fewer weeks of feeding and growing 
this change in breeding temporarily affected the incubation rates 
although this breeding process requires an adjustment period  it has fulfilled expectations concerning weight 
nevertheless  management estimates that the adjustment will be completed during the next fiscal year 
other relevant facts that explain the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales are o average soybean meal prices for increased by when compared to average prices in o inventory reconversion broiler chicken stored in freezing chambers that had to be reconverted to other cuts such as breast  thighs and other chicken parts 
this was necessary to satisfy the demand increase from exports  as well as in the domestic market for chicken and by products  o import of  boxes of fertile eggs  which represent of total produced eggs 
these eggs had an incubation rate of  versus an average that the company produces locally 
o changes in diet formulation for the birds  with the purpose of increasing weight
