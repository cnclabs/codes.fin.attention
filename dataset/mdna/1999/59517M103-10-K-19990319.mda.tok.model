item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company commenced operations in during the past years  the company has designed  manufactured and marketed high power  solid state  rf and microwave power amplifiers and related subsystems for military  medical  satellite and wireless telecommunications applications 
the company historically had been dependent upon the military market as its principal source of revenue 
in  as the military market was declining  the company leveraged its military technological leadership position and increased the scope of its business by entering commercial markets  thereby broadening its product offerings 
in  the company started producing power amplifiers for the wireless telecommunications market 
the company now develops precision high power amplifiers for a variety of commercial uses 
as a result of these efforts  the company is now well positioned to service the low  medium and high volume needs of all of its military and commercial customers 
the following table summarizes certain key financial information change change from from s prior year s prior year s net sales    gross profit    gross profit margin general and administrative expenses    percentage of net sales selling expenses    percentage of net sales research and development expenses    percentage of net sales interest expense   percentage of net sales provision benefit for income taxes n a  effective tax rate results of operations fiscal years ended december  and december  net sales 
the company derives its revenues principally from the sale of solid state  rf and microwave  power amplifiers and from the sale of radar environmental and electronic warfare simulators 
net sales increased by to million in from million in this sales increase was primarily due to higher shipments of the company s military products  partially offset by lower shipments of the company s commercial products 
sales of military products increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales in such years 
the military sales increase was predominantly due to higher shipments on a us government military program and higher shipments to a domestic military oem  partially offset by lower shipments to other military customers 
sales of commercial products decreased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales in such years 
the commercial sales decrease was predominantly due to lower shipments to one domestic and one foreign wireless telecommunications oem and lower shipments to one domestic satellite communications oem  partially offset by higher shipments to other domestic and foreign wireless telecommunications oems 
international sales decreased by to million in from million in  totaling of net sales in compared to in the decrease in international sales was primarily due to lower market demand for foreign wireless telecommunications oem business 
in  sales to two domestic military oems customer f and customer g and one domestic commercial oem customer b accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
in  sales to two domestic commercial oems customer b and customer c and one foreign commercial oem customer a accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
gross profit 
the company s cost of sales consists principally of direct labor  labor overhead  direct material  material overhead  other direct costs and work in process inventory changes from the beginning to the end of a period 
gross profit increased by to million in from million in the company s gross profit margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales also increased to in from in the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to a more favorable revenue mix of higher gross profit margin business in the mpd military versus commercial product lines  a more favorable revenue mix of higher gross profit margin business in the company s single channel versus multi channel wireless product line and a lower commercial warranty expense specifically for the company s multi channel  cellular cdma wireless product 
despite the above  the following factors adversely affected the gross profit margin for i the low gross profit margins the company is experiencing on three foreign military oem contracts the result of technical problems and competitive pricing pressures  ii the costs associated with the introduction and pre production of gsm products and iii the overall low gross profit margin the company is experiencing on one of its single channel  cellular cdma wireless products due to a customer directed slow down  creating inefficient manufacturing lot sizes 
certain of the company s inventory costing techniques involve developing a standard cost which estimates the average  or standard  cost per unit over the extended life cycle of a product 
such costs include labor  material  other direct costs and related overheads 
if the extended life cycle of a product does not materialize or if there is no reasonable certainty that product maturation will take place within the near future  write offs of work in process inventory would be required 
such write offs could materially adversely affect the company s gross profit and results of operations 
certain of the purchase orders or contracts comprising backlog at december  set forth product specifications not yet achieved by the company that would require the company to complete additional product development 
failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to the cancellation of the related purchase orders or contracts 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders or contracts from one or more significant customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurances that gross profit will continue to improve 
if the company is not able to reduce its production costs to the extent anticipated  or to introduce new products with greater gross profit margins  and if average selling prices decline beyond current expectations  the company s gross profit and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company s gross profit may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including the mix of systems and equipment sold  production  reliability or quality problems  and price competition 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and other expenses for management  finance  accounting  contracts and human resources as well as legal and other professional services 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from higher compensation expenses associated  in part  with the company achieving certain fiscal year performance goals  the costs associated with the settlement of an employee related lawsuit and higher professional fees 
selling expenses 
selling expenses consist principally of salaries and other expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  advertising and trade shows 
selling expenses decreased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the decrease in selling expenses resulted primarily from lower accrued warranty costs due to a decrease in wireless warranty requirements  as a percentage of net sales  from the higher levels experienced in early research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist principally of direct labor  labor overhead  direct material  material overhead and other direct costs associated with product development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from increased wireless telecommunications product development and  to a lesser extent  increased military research and development 
the company believes that the continued introduction of new products is essential to its competitiveness  especially in the wireless telecommunications market  and is committed to continued investment in research and development 
the company viewed the lower level of wireless telecommunications product development in as a short term solution to assist in reducing costs to match reduced wireless revenue 
fundamental to this effort was a planned temporary reallocation in the first quarter of of some of the company s engineering and technology resources to either revenue producing or customer funded product development 
this action enabled the company to leverage its other commercial and military product lines while insuring a continued and focused emphasis on critical wireless telecommunications development projects 
the company views the level of research and development expenses incurred during to be more indicative of typical research and development expenses for the company 
interest expense 
interest expense consists principally of interest expended on the company s credit facility and idrbs  partially offset by interest earned on the company s cash balances 
interest expense remained relatively stable at million in both and and represented and  respectively  of net sales 
provision for income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the company has recorded deferred tax assets for the benefit of federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards nols and timing differences generated in those years 
the company has reserved a portion of the deferred tax asset with respect to its nols 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the nols 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
the company s effective tax rate increased to in from in the rate was favorably impacted by the partial recovery of the previously reserved deferred tax asset resulting from the company s improved profitability position as compared to without the benefit of this change in the reserve  the effective tax rate for would have been 
the rate was also favorably impacted by the partial recovery of the previously reserved deferred tax asset resulting from the company s improved profitability position as compared to without the benefit of this change in the reserve  the effective tax rate for would have been 
the company will continue to assess the reserved deferred tax asset each reporting quarter 
there can be no assurances that the company will continue to achieve taxable income in the future 
fiscal years ended december  and december  net sales 
net sales increased by to million in from million in this sales increase was primarily due to higher shipments of the company s commercial products  partially offset by slightly lower shipments of the company s military products 
sales of commercial products increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales in such years 
the commercial sales increase was predominantly due to higher shipments to one domestic wireless telecommunications oem and one satellite communications oem  partially offset by lower shipments to one foreign wireless telecommunications oem 
sales of military products decreased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales in such years 
the military sales decrease was predominantly due to an overall lower market demand for republic products 
international sales decreased by to million in from million in  totaling of net sales in compared to in the decrease in international sales was primarily due to lower foreign wireless telecommunications oem business  partially offset by higher foreign military business 
in  sales to two domestic commercial oems customer b and customer c and a foreign commercial oem customer a accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
in  sales to a foreign commercial oem customer a and a domestic commercial oem customer b accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by to million in from million in the company s gross profit margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase in the gross profit margin was primarily due to the non recurrence of the million write off of wireless multi channel work in process inventory caused by then diminished demand for those particular products  the million write off of wireless multi channel work in process inventory related to the cancellation of the remainder of the airnet contract and the million write off of wireless single channel work in process inventory caused by a domestic commercial oem s decision to internally manufacture amplifiers for the production portion of the pcs tdma program 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the non recurrence of the above mentioned items plus the recognition of a more favorable gross profit associated with the net sales increase in in addition  the following factors adversely affected the company s gross profit margin i low gross profits the company is experiencing on three military oem contracts the result of production delays  technical problems and software integration difficulties  ii the overall low gross profit margin obtainable on the company s multi channel product line the result of competitive pricing pressures  iii engineering and manufacturing difficulties experienced on the pre production phase of two newer wireless products and iv a high level of warranty expense as a percentage of net sales specifically related to those warranty costs associated with the company s more recent introduction of wireless telecommunications products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the company wide upgrade of computer hardware  software and data processing equipment that portion of which did not meet the company s capitalization criteria as well as higher accounting and legal expenses 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in selling expenses resulted primarily from higher bid and proposal expenses incurred in connection with a million foreign military order awarded in the third quarter of and a generally higher level of proposal activity across all product lines 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the decrease in research and development expenses resulted primarily from reduced military and  to a lesser extent  wireless telecommunications product development efforts 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by to million in from million in  primarily reflecting increased average borrowings under the company s credit facility 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate decreased to in from in the rate was favorably impacted by the partial recovery of the previously reserved deferred tax asset resulting from the company s improved profitability position as compared to without the benefit of this change in the reserve  the effective tax rate for would have been 
the company will continue to assess the reserved deferred tax asset each reporting quarter 
the rate was due to the net loss incurred by the company in  the benefit of which the company expects to utilize to offset future taxable income  as prescribed by sfas no 
liquidity and capital resources since the company successfully completed its ipo in  the company has financed its operations and met its capital requirements through the following two sources i a credit facility and or ii cash provided by operating activities 
in february  the company entered into a loan agreement with ibj schroder business credit corporation ibj which provides for a million credit facility consisting of a revolving line of credit in the amount of million  a term loan in the amount of million and a million capital equipment capex loan facility 
the revolving line of credit and both the term loan and capex loan bear interest at annual rates equal to the prime rate plus and  respectively 
the credit facility matures in february and automatically renews for one year periods thereafter  unless terminated by either the company or ibj 
aggregate borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited by a borrowing base  which is calculated as the sum of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible raw materials and work in process inventories with borrowings based on aggregate eligible inventory limited to million 
the term loan requires a monthly principal payment of million 
the revolving line of credit increases each month commensurate with term loan repayments until a maximum revolving line of credit of million is reached 
the capex loan requires monthly principal payments that are recalculated each month based on the prior month s capex borrowings  if any  amortized over months 
capex loan borrowings had to occur prior to february   at which time the aggregate capex loan borrowings totaled million 
at december   the term loan balance was million  borrowings under the million capex facility were million with a balance due of million and borrowings under the million revolving line of credit were million 
the credit facility is subject to customary covenants  including  among other things  limitations with respect to incurring indebtedness  payment of dividends and affiliate advances  and a provision for maintaining a certain fixed charge coverage ratio 
operating activities provided net cash of million and million in and  respectively 
from december  to december   accounts receivable increased by million  inventory increased by million  accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by million and customer advance payments decreased by million 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the higher revenue level in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of especially in december versus december 
in addition  receivables were higher due to a us government military progress payment program which reached the liquidation crossover point  in the fourth quarter of  which created a higher percentage receivable associated with each deliverable shipment 
the increase in inventory was predominantly due to the build up required to satisfy the needs of the recently awarded wireless consignment order and a customer directed slow down on one cellular cdma program  partially offset by a decrease in inventory associated with two long term military programs and build to forecast military products 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily the result of higher supplier trade credit 
the decrease in customer advance payments was primarily due to the use of advance payments received in the fourth quarter of  and in the second quarter of  from a foreign military oem 
investing activities  which consisted primarily of equipment acquisitions  used net cash of million and million in and  respectively 
financing activities  which consisted predominantly of proceeds from long term debt  net repayments on the credit facility and principal payments of long term debt  provided net cash of million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures were funded primarily through cash provided by a capex loan under the company s credit facility in and cash provided by beginning of year cash balances  operating activities and the company s credit facility in principal capital expenditures for included the procurement of engineering and manufacturing test equipment and the purchase of a second automated surface mount pick n place machine 
the company expects that capital expenditures  anticipated to include additional engineering and manufacturing test equipment  will be financed by cash provided by operating activities  the company s credit facility and or third party financing sources 
as of december   the company had working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million as of december  working capital as of december  included approximately million and million in accounts receivable and inventory  respectively  compared to december  working capital which included approximately million and million in accounts receivable and inventory  respectively 
the company s current ratio ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of december  was  compared with a current ratio of as of december  as of december  the company s debt to equity ratio was  compared with a debt to equity ratio at december  of the company believes that cash generated from operations  amounts available under its credit facility  and or other third party financing will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures and to provide adequate working capital for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not require additional financing prior to such date to fund its operations  and  if required  that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  the company may require additional financing after such date to fund its operations 
year the company has developed a year readiness plan 
this plan addresses three main areas a information technology systems including the company s business systems  engineering and test equipment  both hardware and software related  b non information technology systems including embedded technology such as microcontrollers  typically found in such equipment as telephone systems  fax systems  elevators  security systems  hvac  etc 
and c supply chain readiness or third party issues including customers as well as inventory and non inventory suppliers 
the company s chief operating and financial officer has been tasked with overseeing this process and reports periodically to the company s board of directors 
the company has identified potential deficiencies related to year in its information technology systems and is in the process of addressing them through upgrades or other remediation 
for example  in the company s business and computing system was upgraded and is now year compliant according to the company s software providers 
the company expects to complete remediation and testing of its internal systems in the second quarter of in terms of non information technology systems  the company has identified those material items which may require remediation or replacement 
the company is in the process of addressing those items and expects to complete remediation or replacement and testing of its non information technology systems in the second quarter of as for third parties  the company is in the process of identifying and contacting suppliers  both inventory and non inventory  as well as customers 
this process includes the solicitation of written responses to questionnaires and or meetings with certain third parties 
the company expects to have a better understanding of the year readiness of these third parties over the next several months 
based upon the company s current estimates  additional out of pocket costs associated with its year compliance are not expected to be material 
these costs are anticipated to be incurred primarily in and include third party consultants  remediation of existing computer software and replacement or remediation of embedded chips 
such costs do not include internal management time and the deferral of other projects  the effects of which are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
at this point in time  the company believes that it is difficult to specifically identify the cause of the most reasonable worst case year scenario 
as with all engineering and manufacturing companies  a reasonable worst case scenario would be the result of failures of third parties including  without limitation  governmental entities and entities with which the company has no direct involvement that continue for more than several days in various geographic areas from which the company s raw materials and components are sourced or to which the company s products are sold 
in connection with the production of products and the procurement of raw materials and components  the company is considering various contingency plans 
continuing failures in key geographic areas in the united states and in certain european and asian countries that limit procurement or delivery of product  would most likely have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the extent of such lost revenue cannot be estimated at this time  however  the company is considering contingency plans to limit  to the extent possible  the effect of such lost revenue on the company s result of operations 
any such plans would necessarily be limited to matters over which the company can reasonably control 
the company s year efforts are ongoing and its overall plan  as well as the consideration of contingency plans  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available 
while the company anticipates continuity of its business activities  that continuity will be dependent upon its ability  and the ability of third parties with whom the company relies on directly  or indirectly  to be year compliant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal financial instrument is long term debt under a credit facility consisting of a revolving line of credit  term loan and capex loan facility that provides for interest at a spread above the prime rate 
the company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under this credit facility 
a significant rise in the prime rate could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
at december   an aggregate principal amount of million was outstanding under the company s credit facility  with spreads ranging from to over prime  and represented a weighted average interest rate of 
if principal amounts outstanding under the company s credit facility remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by  the company would pay or save  respectively  an additional million in interest in that year 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose 
where appropriate  the company requires that letters of credit be provided on foreign sales 
in addition  all transactions by the company are denominated in us dollars 
as such  the company has shifted foreign currency exposure onto its foreign customers 
as a result  if exchange rates move against foreign customers  the company could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable  the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders 
the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
