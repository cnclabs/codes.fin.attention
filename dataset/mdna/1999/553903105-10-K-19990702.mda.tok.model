at april   the company s days sales outstanding were days  as compared to days at april  the company s average days sales outstanding is impacted by the high percentage of sales occurring within the last month of each quarter and the large percentage of international sales  which historically have slower payment patterns 
the increase is primarily due to a higher percentage of sales occurring within the last month of fiscal year than the percentage of sales occurring within the last month of fiscal year effective july   the company entered into an agreement with silicon valley bank and general electric capital corporation whereby the company may borrow up to million under an asset secured domestic line of credit  limited by the value of pledged collateral 
the agreement allows the company to borrow at a rate equal to prime rate 
borrowings under the line of credit are subject to certain financial and operating covenants  including  without limitation  various financial covenants requiring the company to maintain a minimum current ratio  debt net worth ratio  tangible net worth and level of profitability  and restricts the company from paying any dividends 
the initial term of the agreement is for one year 
borrowings outstanding under this agreement at june  were million 
effective february   the company entered into an agreement with emc  whereby the company sold to emc substantially all of the company s existing patents  patent applications and rights thereof 
the consideration the company received for these rights includes million to be received in six equal annual installments of million each  the first four of which were received in february  january  january and january the remaining payments are to be received in each of the subsequent two years beginning january the company will also receive royalty payments in the aggregate of up to a maximum of million over the term of the agreement 
as part of the maximum million of royalties  minimum royalties of million will be received in five annual installments  beginning within thirty days of the first anniversary of the effective date of the agreement  and within thirty days of each subsequent anniversary thereof 
the first three annual installments were received in march  march and march also  as part of the of the maximum million of royalties  million of royalties will be received in five equal annual installments beginning march as a result of the announced computer and technology pact between emc and ibm in march management believes that the company s working capital  bank lines of credit and cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months  however  in the longer term  the company may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements including financing of accounts receivable and inventory  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such funds through public or private equity financing  bank lines of credit or from other sources 
the company s current line of credit agreement will expire in july the company has begun negotiations for a renewal of its existing credit facility and believes the company will be able to secure comparable financing prior to the expiration of the existing credit facility 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms favorable to the company 
inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations in the past 
there can be no assurance  however  that they will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in future periods 
upgrade of existing computer infrastructure  year issue in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this situation is generally referred to as the year issue 
if such a situation occurs  the potential exists for system failures or miscalculations  which could disrupt operations 
the company is in the process of upgrading its existing computer infrastructure and replacing all of its manufacturing  accounting  customer service and other management information software with an enterprise wide business system which it believes is year compliant based on representations of the manufacturers 
the manufacturing and accounting systems have been replaced 
although the company expects that remaining components of the enterprise wide business system installation will be completed by the end of  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve this installation on time or that unexpected compliance issues will not arise 
further  the company has never undertaken such a significant modification to its information management systems and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience significant delays and or compatibility issues in the installation and testing of the enterprise wide business system 
the new enterprise wide business system will also require extensive training across all departments 
any delays or significant issues with respect to installation or training could materially adversely effect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has substantially completed a comprehensive remediation plan for the year issue that includes the assessment  rectification  testing and reporting of product compliance  the receipt and review of third party representations of year compliance and assessment  and rectification and testing of all internal it and non it systems 
the company anticipates that remediation will be complete by august as a part of the remediation plan  the company will evaluate the need for  and complete if necessary  a contingency plan in the event any non compliant critical systems remain by january  the company has received representations from the majority of suppliers and is continuing to evaluate the adequacy of the responses 
the company has identified certain suppliers that are critical to the business and is in the process of performing site visits to better understand the suppliers status regarding year compliance 
evaluation of suppliers is an ongoing process and this phase will continue through the end of calendar as the company will continue to update and reevaluate the status of critical suppliers 
the company has tested the majority of its products for year compliance 
the results of these tests are published on the company s website at http www 
mti 
com other year index 
htm 
testing on the remaining products is expected to continue through the end of calendar the company has initiated a plan notifying customers of the information available on the website and to encourage them to assess their own systems based on their operating environment and the information provided by the company 
the company has completed the assessment of its critical internal it and non it systems 
the assessment phase  including assessment of hardware and software not supported by the company s it department  is expected to be complete by august management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario related to the year issue that the company may experience  would be the delay or inability to procure inventory components from suppliers or delays in receiving orders or payments from customers due to year issues experienced by third parties 
such factors could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company does not consider the cost of upgrading its existing computer infrastructure and replacing all of its manufacturing  accounting  customer service and other management information software with an enterprise wide business system to be a cost relating to year compliance  because the project was initiated independent of the year issue and the project completion date has not been accelerated in order to achieve compliance 
as of june   the company has incurred year costs consisting primarily of internal labor costs 
the company anticipates that costs to complete year compliance will continue to consist primarily of internal labor costs and be immaterial  but there can be no assurance that unanticipated costs will not be incurred 
the company expects year compliance during calendar year however  there can be no assurances that the company or third parties will not experience delays or obstacles in becoming year compliant and any delay or failure by the company or critical third parties in achieving year compliance could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risk factors the non historical information in this form k constitute forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to the company s future plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
we may identify these statements by the use of words such as believes  expects  anticipates  intends  plans and similar expressions 
the actual results for the company may differ materially from those described in any forward looking statement 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and throughout this form k 
the forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this form k 
dependence on new products the computer industry is characterized by rapid technological change and is highly competitive with respect to product innovation and introduction 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new  innovative product with features that respond to customers changing demands will be critical to its future success 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to design and manufacture products that will achieve market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure to design  manufacture  and successfully introduce products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the success of new products is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion of product design  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields and market acceptance 
additional risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors  competitors responses to the introductions  accurate forecasting of customer demand  and the desire by customers to evaluate new  more expensive products for longer periods of time 
continued product development efforts are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new products  including unanticipated development problems and delays  as well as the costs to undertake the development that could result in abandonment or substantial change in the development of a specific product 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies 
management of growth the company has experienced rapid growth in past years 
the company anticipates that continued growth  if any  will require management of that growth  including but not limited to  recruiting  hiring  training and retaining significant numbers of qualified personnel  forecasting revenues  controlling expenses and managing assets 
in particular  continued growth will require that the company train  integrate and retain qualified sales personnel in various geographic regions 
as the company is in a highly competitive growth market  the loss of a significant number of such persons  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional personnel in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
should the company experience rapid growth  there can be no assurance that the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that management will adequately anticipate all demands that growth will place on the company 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company and the quality of could be materially adversely affected 
competition the market for the company s products is extremely competitive 
the company competes with many companies  certain of which have substantially greater financial and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and greater overall customer loyalty than the company 
in addition  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there also has been  and may continue to be  a willingness on the part of certain large competitors to reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share  which cannot be foreseen by the company 
the company believes that pricing pressures are likely to continue as competitors develop more competitive product offerings 
the principal elements of competition in the company s markets include rapid introduction of new technology  product quality and reliability  price and performance characteristics  service and support  and responsiveness to customers 
the company believes that  in general  it competes favorably with respect to these factors 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
international sales international sales continue to represent a significant portion of the company s total revenue 
these sales activities are subject to the normal risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuating exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
other risks inherent in the company s international business include longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
most of the sales made by the company in international markets are priced in the applicable local currency and are subject to currency exchange fluctuations 
the company may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in an attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure 
there can be no assurance that the use of such contracts will be sufficient to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
international sales are subject to the risk of compliance with laws of various countries and the risk of import export restrictions and tariff regulations 
dependence on suppliers the principal components used in the company s products include circuit boards  drives and chassis 
the company procures all of its parts from outside suppliers and has established manufacturing relationships with a number of key suppliers  primarily of disk drives  tape and tape library systems 
the company generally utilizes parts and components available from multiple vendors 
however  components critical to the current design of the company s and series of products  namely a raid controller board manufactured by mylex corporation  is available to the company only from this source 
disruptions in supply or material increases in the cost of these components would have an adverse effect on the company 
uneven pattern of quarterly results the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates that these fluctuations may continue in the future 
these fluctuations have been and may continue to be caused by a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  the timing of customer orders a large majority of which have historically been placed in the last month of each quarter  the timing of the introduction of new products and new versions of the company s products  shifts in product mix and the timing of sales and marketing and research and development expenditures 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of these and other factors  including the company s ability to continue to develop innovative products  the introduction of new products by the company s competitors and decreases in gross profit margin for mature products 
in addition  the company has operated historically without a significant backlog of orders and  as a result  net product revenue in any quarter is dependent on orders booked and products shipped during that quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
if revenue does not meet the company s expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact on the company s liquidity position and net income may be magnified by the company s inability to reduce expenditures quickly enough to compensate for the revenue shortfall 
further  as is common in the computer industry  the company historically has experienced an increase in the number of orders and shipments in the latter part of each quarter and the company expects this pattern to continue in the future 
the company s failure to receive anticipated orders or to complete shipments in the latter part of a quarter could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable on a quarter to quarter basis or that future revenues and operating results will not be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s common stock 
volatility of stock price the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility in response to the timing and announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  variations in quarterly results of operations  failure of such results of operations to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community and speculation in the press or investment community 
in addition  the stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to the operating performance of the company 
recent trends should not be considered a reliable indication of future stock prices or financial results 
intellectual property rights the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements and technical measures to protect its intellectual property rights 
although the company continues to take appropriate measures to protect its intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be sold may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
if such a claim is made  the company will evaluate the claim as it relates to its products and  if appropriate  may seek a license to use the protected technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain a license to use such technology or that such a license could be obtained on terms that would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
if the company or its suppliers are unable to license protected technology  the company could be prohibited from incorporating or marketing products incorporating that technology 
the company could also incur substantial costs to redesign its products or to defend any legal action taken against it 
should the company s products be found to infringe protected technology  the company could be required to pay damages to the infringed party or be enjoined from manufacturing and selling such products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
control by principal shareholder raymond j 
noorda  the chairman of the board of the company  owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
as a result of his ownership  mr 
noorda is able to substantially control actions of the company which require stockholder approval  including the election of the board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of changing or preventing a change in control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company transacts in foreign currencies  primarily european  and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange risks  particularly the british pound sterling 
the volatility of the pound and other currencies will be monitored in the coming year and the company may utilize hedging programs  currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly used to reduce financial market risks 
the company maintains a million credit line 
the interest rate applied to any debt outstanding under this credit line is equal to the prime rate and is  therefore  subject to a certain amount of risk arising from fluctuations in these rates 
however  a increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations
