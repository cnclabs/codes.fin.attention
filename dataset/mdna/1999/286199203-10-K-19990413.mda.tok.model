see below  and note xx to the audited financial statements for discussion and reconciliation between cdn gaap and united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
income from restaurant operations income from restaurant operations  at cdn  was up over and  as a percentage of sales  increased to in from in there are four principal reasons for this improvement 
firstly  the opening of higher volume stores and closing of two lower volume locations enhanced overall operating margins 
secondly  food and beverage cost percentages showed improvement throughout the year 
thirdly  labor cost percentages were lower than the previous year 
fourthly  the figure included cdn  in costs relating to the closure of two restaurants during the year and cdn  related to a lease guarantee on a former location 
sales sales increased during the year to cdn  from cdn  in the company s joint venture with rainforest cafe inc opened its first location during  in vancouver june th 
the company also entered a franchise agreement for its corporately owned location in london  ontario on september  the company opened three locations in  in seattle august th  boston november th and edmonton november th 
it also closed two low volume locations in vancouver in february and thunder bay in august as their leases expired 
the result of opening higher volume stores and closing lower volume locations has seen the average weekly sales volume per unit in increase by over the figure 
for the twelve canadian locations open throughout both years  sales totaled cdn  and were up from for the four us locations open throughout both years  sales decreased from a decrease at the bellingham  wa location accounted for the majority of the decrease 
the mall in which this restaurant is located is largely dependent on canadian cross border shoppers and the relative decrease in value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar has caused mall traffic to decline 
the year on year impact of this is expected to be much less severe in the company s rainforest cafe joint venture opened its first location  in vancouver  bc  in june  its second unit opened in metro toronto in february  sales continue to be in line with management s expectations 
costs and expenses food and beverage costs overall  food and beverage costs  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to for the corresponding period in the company implemented a number of purchasing programs in that decreased the food and beverage percentage during the year  and generated recovery of certain rebates and credits from prior years 
labor and benefits costs labor and benefits costs decreased from of sales in to for the period 
the company is continuing to review labor schedules and believes further labor efficiencies are deliverable 
occupancy and other costs occupancy and other operating costs decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in this is primarily the result of the company s strategy of focusing new developments in high traffic urban locations and moving away from its traditional suburban mall locations 
this is resulting in lower occupancy percentages at the newer locations and is driving the overall rate down 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization costs increased slightly to of sales for compared to in higher development costs and shorter amortization periods at new locations  compared to older suburban mall locations  plus amortization of higher pre opening costs  are the cause of the increase in the percentage 
restaurant closing costs during the company closed two mall locations on the expiration of their respective leases 
the costs associated with these closings were approximately cdn  the company also incurred costs of cdn  related to a lease guarantee on a former property 
the company did not close any locations during  although it did enter into a franchise agreement for its london  ontario location 
there was no net cost to the company 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses increased from of sales in to in the figure contains full year costs for three new executives hired in the second half of  causing the overall rate to increase 
hiring these executives was a necessary step in the development of the infrastructure needed to allow the company to expand and return to profitability 
mr 
martin o dowd  former president of rainforest cafe inc  joined the company in august  as president of the us operations with the mandate to expand the company s us presence and to oversee the development of rainforest cafes in canada 
in march  mr 
o dowd was appointed president and chief executive officer of the company 
mr 
colin stacey  former president of keg restaurants  also joined the company in august   as chief operating officer responsible for canadian operations 
in march  he was given responsibility for all canadian and us elephant castle and alamo locations 
mr 
richard bryant  formerly chief financial officer of keg restaurants  joined the company in november  as chief financial officer 
while the costs of these executives  plus other additions to corporate management caused general and administrative costs to rise over the near term  the company believes its long term general and expense percentage will be brought down to under as new stores are added without incurring proportionate additional costs 
retiring allowances and other costs in december  one of the founders of the company  mr 
peter barnett retired from his position as executive vice president 
under the terms of his employment contract mr 
barnett was paid a retiring allowance on his retirement 
other costs arose from settlement of two labor matters with former employees 
there were no such items in interest on long term debt interest on long term debt increased to cdn  in from cdn  in there are three main reasons for the increase 
firstly  during the company completed two us  for a total of cdn  financings 
the first was a convertible debenture financing with general electric private placement partners  ii geippp ii as part of a agreement 
the second  also with geippp ii  was part of a convertible debenture financing that saw an additional us  cdn  raised from other investors in february  secondly  during the company also completed two us  cdn  each  for a total of cdn  convertible subordinated debenture financings with geippp ii under the agreement 
the year includes a full year s interest on the financings 
thirdly  the decline in the relative value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar during resulted in a translation adjustment of cdn  cdn  of which is included in interest expense for the year 
the balance of the translation adjustment will be charged to interest expense over the life of the related debt 
as a result of these factors   interest on long term debt in was substantially higher than  and will be higher again in loss before taxes the company incurred a loss before income taxes of cdn  in compared to a loss of cdn  in the figure includes a total of cdn  in restaurant closing costs  retiring allowances and other costs 
there were no such costs in the loss before these items was cdn 
during  income from restaurant operations increased by cdn  this was offset by an increase of cdn  in general and administrative expenses and cdn  in interest costs 
management believes the additions it made to executive management during  plus the additional financings it has been successful in completing  have positioned the company to successfully roll out its expansion plans  including the development of rainforest cafe in canada 
management is targeting a return to profitability in income taxes the company incurred losses in each of and and therefore has no tax liability 
the company also has loss carry forwards which will reduce its effective tax rate in future years

the financial statements  if prepared in accordance with us gaap would have differed as follows net loss for the year ended december  would be decreased by cdn  comprised of recognition of non capital loss carry forwards  offset by dividends on paid in capital that would be treated as interest under us gaap  and by amortization expense resulting from exclusion of the first option period in calculating the amortization of certain leasehold improvements 
the impact of this adjustment would be to decrease the net loss per share from cdn under canadian gaap to cdn under us gaap 
net loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by cdn  also comprised of amortization expense resulting from the exclusion of the first option period in calculating the amortization of certain leasehold improvements 
on a per share basis  net loss would have been increased from cdn under canadian gaap to cdn under us gaap
