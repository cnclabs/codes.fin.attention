item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december  and the following summary financial data and the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the years ended december  and the consolidated entity includes security bank holding company the company  or sbhc  a bank holding company  its wholly owned subsidiaries  security bank  pacific state bank and family security bank  and its majority owned subsidiaries  lincoln security bank and mckenzie state bank 
collectively within this document  the consolidated entity is referred to as the company 
acquisition of pacific state bank in june  the company and pacific state bank psb announced a definitive agreement to merge in a stock for stock exchange 
the transaction  accounted for as a pooling of interests  was consummated on november   in an exchange of shares of sbhc common stock for each share of psb common stock 
there were  shares of sbhc common stock issued for  shares of psb common stock 
all prior period financial data has been restated to include psb 
the acquisition of psb was pursued due to their excellent historical financial performance  excessively strong capital levels and their geographic location 
psb is located on the oregon coast  approximately miles north of coos bay 
as such  it was a natural extension of the company s franchise of community banks 
psb s performance numbers both return on equity and return on assets will strengthen those of the overall company 
finally  the additional capital will enable the company to pursue other aspects of it s growth strategy 
results of operations the operating results of the company depend primarily on net interest income 
the company s net interest income is determined by interest rate spread  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net income is also affected by the establishment of provisions for loan losses and the level of its other income  including service charges on deposit accounts and sold real estate loan fees  as well as its other expenses and income tax provisions

in addition  as part of the company s growth strategy  the new de novo mckenzie state bank opened in november the company recognized a  loss from mckenzie state bank in resulting from start up costs 
the company also identified equipment that was non year compliant and or going to be taken out of production early in this resulted in accelerating the depreciation of the carrying cost 
in addition  the company incurred consulting fees in related to year  resulting in a total expense of  recognized in each of these adjustments is discussed in detail within this report 
net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income principally from loans and investment securities and interest expense principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread  and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the differences between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
the company s profitability  like that of many financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income 
since the company tends to be asset sensitive  as interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities in a given period  a significant decrease in the market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
in contrast  an increasing interest rate environment could favorably impact net interest income 
competition and the economy also impact the company s net interest income 
net interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased  or in as compared to of the net decrease of  an increase in volume accounted for an increase in net interest income of  while a decrease in spread accounted for a decrease in net interest income of  average interest earning assets increased million  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million 
the increase in average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities resulted from an increase in deposits  offset by a decrease in borrowings from the federal home loan bank of million 
the average net interest spread decreased from to  mainly due to decreased average earning asset yields which declined basis points from to 
the low flat interest rate yield curve has caused variable rate repricing on assets over the period decreasing asset yields 
in addition  certain fixed rate loans and investments have refinanced repriced at the lower rates over the period 
average rates paid decreased basis points to in from for  primarily from a reduction in deposit cost  offset partially by the early prepayment penalty of federal home loan bank borrowings 
the company s net interest margin for was  a decrease of basis points from for the company expects to see further declines in its net interest margin due to continued anticipated refinance activity caused by the low interest rate environment and continued competition in the markets it serves 
provision for loan losses 
management s policy is to maintain an adequate reserve for loan loss based on historical trends  current economic forecasts  statistical analysis of the loan portfolio  as well as detailed review of individual loans and current loan performance 
the provision for loan losses was  and  for and  respectively 
net charge offs were  and  for and  respectively 
the reserve for loan losses was  at december   as compared to  at december  the company s ratio of reserve for loan losses to total loans was at december   compared to at december  the company increased the reserve for loan losses in the fourth quarter of to to address regulatory recommendations 
the loan loss reserve ratio for the company s peer group ranges from to 
regulatory recommendations did not address specific loans within the bank s portfolios  but rather recommended the reserve be increased to more closely match the company s peer group 
non performing assets defined as loans on non accrual status  days or more past due  and other real estate owned were  and  at december  and  respectively 
management believes the loans are adequately secured and that no significant losses will be incurred 
management has in place a comprehensive loan approval process and an asset quality monitoring system 
management continues its efforts to collect accounts previously charged off and to originate loans of high quality 
management believes the reserve for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb credit losses on specifically identified loans as well as estimated probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the portfolio 
further additions to the reserve for loan losses could become necessary  depending upon the performance of the banks loan portfolios or changes in economic conditions  as well as growth within the loan portfolio and results of examinations by regulators 
non interest income 
non interest income increased  or  in to  as compared to  in service charges on deposit accounts increased  as overall deposit levels have increased 
gain on sale of investment securities has decreased from  resulting from non recurring gains the company had on restructuring the investment portfolio in the third quarter of sold real estate loan fees have increased  or  in as compared to  resulting from expansion of the company s mortgage operations and increased refinancing activity with the overall lower interest rate environment 
other income has decreased  or from  resulting primarily from a non recurring gain on sale of a rental building in of  merger related costs  comprised of professional fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of pacific state bank  were  and  for and  respectively 
esop compensation expense 
the company sponsors an employee stock ownership plan esop  a leveraged employee retirement benefit plan which owns approximately of the common stock of the company 
shares are released through dividends on allocated shares  and through compensation expense a non cash charge to the income statement 
compensation expense is calculated by multiplying the shares released as compensation by the average share price of the company s common stock for the year 
two components of shareholders equity are also affected 
there is a reduction in unearned esop shares at cost  and an increase in surplus at the difference between the fair market value and the cost of the shares  thereby creating no impact on shareholders equity and off setting the compensation expense recorded on the income statement 
as shares are released  they are considered outstanding for the purposes of calculating earnings per share and book value per share 
based upon the increase in share price over the past years  the company has considered several remedies to contain the expense recorded as the share price of the company increased 
options included pursuing a private letter ruling with the internal revenue service in an effort to extend the related debt service  which would have reduce the number of shares released each year and thereby reduce the expense recognized 
in december  the company approved a second option  which was to deleverage the esop 
the company shortened the esop tax year  permitting the repayment of the internal esop debt in one fiscal year  split over two plan years 
all unallocated shares were released for allocation 
as a result  the company recognized  in esop compensation expense for  thereby eliminating this expense burden from future years 
other non interest expense 
other non interest expense excluding esop compensation expense and merger related expense as discussed previously increased to  in as compared to  in salaries and employee benefits  the largest non interest expense  increased  or 
approximately  of this increase is related to increased mortgage operations  which resulted in increased sold real estate loan fee income of  the remaining increase results from the continuing expansion activities of the company 
equipment costs and professional fees increased  also resulting from the increased operations and expansion activities of the company 
also included in other expense is the write off of organizational costs 
in prior years  the company capitalized and amortized these costs over a five year period 
in accordance with the newly issued aicpa statement of position sop  the company expensed  in of start up costs related to expansion which would have been capitalized before sop the company also wrote off the unamortized balance of start up costs of  net of tax  as of the beginning of the year 
in  the company established an accrual for year related costs incurred in of  this accrual was established for consulting costs associated with on going year efforts and equipment replacement 
the company has a detailed discussion of year issues beginning on page of this report 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes has decreased significantly from  resulting from the overall net book loss in the tax benefit associated with esop compensation expense is calculated on the debt retired  not the expense recognized 
as such  the effective tax rate increased 
also included in this amount is the tax expense of lincoln security bank and the tax benefit of mckenzie state bank  each of which is not included in the consolidated tax return  as the company owns less than of them 
loan losses and recoveries the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is based on the company s loan loss experience and such factors which  in management s judgment  deserve recognition in estimating possible loan losses 
management monitors the loan portfolio to ensure that the reserve for loan losses is adequate to cover outstanding loans on non accrual status and any current loans deemed to be in serious doubt of repayment according to each loan s repayment plan 
the following table summarizes the company s reserve for loan losses  and charge off and recovery activity year ended december  dollars in thousands loans outstanding at end of period   average loans outstanding during the period   reserve balance  beginning of period   recoveries commercial real estate installment credit card loans charged off commercial real estate installment credit card net loans charged off provision charged to operations  reserve balance  end of period   ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding lending and credit management although a risk of nonpayment exists with respect to all loans  certain specific types of risks are associated with different types of loans 
due to the nature of the company s customer base and the growth experienced in coos  curry  lincoln  douglas  and lane counties  real estate is frequently a material component of collateral for the company s loans 
the expected source of repayment of these loans is generally the operations of the borrower s business or personal income  but real estate provides an additional measure of security 
risks associated with real estate loans include fluctuating land values  local economic conditions  changes in tax policies  and a concentration of loans within a limited geographic market area 
the company mitigates risk on construction loans by generally lending funds to customers that have been pre qualified for long term financing and who are using contractors acceptable to the company 
the commercial real estate risk is further mitigated by making the majority of commercial real estate loans on owner occupied properties 
the company manages the general risks inherent in the loan portfolio by following loan policies and underwriting practices designed to result in prudent lending activities 
for example  the company limits commercial loans to of the value of the collateral  and residential mortgages  which may be first or second liens  to of the value of the collateral 
residential loans with a loan to value greater than carry private mortgage insurance 
the following table presents information with respect to non performing assets december  dollars in thousands loans on non accrual status loans past due greater than days  not on non accrual status other real estate owned  net total non performing assets percentage of non performing assets to total assets 

interest income which would have been realized on non accrual or past due loans if they had remained current was insignificant 
allocation of reserve for loan losses the company does not normally allocate the reserve for loan losses to specific loan categories with the exception of credit cards 
an allocation by credit quality is made below for presentation purposes 
this allocation process does not necessarily measure anticipated future credit losses  rather  it seeks to measure the company s assessment at a point in time of perceived credit loss exposure and the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions

the loan loss reserve ratio for the company s peer group range from to 
regulatory recommendations did not address specific loans within the banks portfolios  but rather recommended the reserve be increased to more closely match the company s peer group 
an assessment was made of the bank s loan customers ability to address the year issues

approximately million of the deposit growth was generated by mckenzie state bank  the new de novo majority owned subsidiary of the company in springfield  oregon 
mckenzie state bank began operations in november the low interest rate environment has resulted in increased calls on callable agency securities  and has accelerated repayments on mortgage backed investment securities 
due to the flat yield curve  the company has taken a defensive posture and retained the majority of these funds in federal funds sold throughout in december  the company utilized the excess cash in federal funds sold and prepaid approximately million in federal home loan bank borrowings  which were costing the company a higher rate than what was being earned in federal funds sold 
the company incurred a prepayment penalty in associated with the early repayment  which will improve the net interest margin in the company has increased premises and equipment at december   as compared to december   resulting from the growth initiatives underway 
approximately million in new premises results from the construction of two new branches of security bank 
the company also purchased land for  for the permanent facility of the new de novo mckenzie state bank 
liquidity liquidity enables the company to meet the withdrawals of its depositors and the borrowing needs of its loan customers 
the company s primary sources of funds are customer deposits  maturities of investment securities  sales of available for sale securities  loan sales  loan repayments  net income  advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle  and the use of the federal funds markets 
the company maintains three unsecured lines of credit totaling million for the purchase of funds on an overnight basis 
as discussed previously  the company is also a member of the federal home loan bank of seattle  which provides a secured line of credit in the amount of million  and other funding opportunities for liquidity and asset liability matching 
over the last four years  these lines have been used periodically 
as of december   million were borrowed under the company s unsecured lines of credit and there were no borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
interest rates charged on the lines are determined by market factors 
the company s liquidity has been stable and adequate over the past several years 
short term deposits have continued to grow and excess investible cash is invested on a short term basis into federal funds sold 
the company s primary source of funds are consumer deposits and commercial accounts 
these funds are not subject to significant movements as a result of changing interest rates and other economic factors  and therefore enhance the company s long term liquidity 
capital resources beginning in  federal regulators required the calculation of risk based capital 
this is an analysis that weights balance sheet and off balance sheet items for their inherent risk 
it requires minimum standards for risk based capital by capital tier 
full implementation of this analysis was required in  requiring a minimum total risk based capital ratio of and a minimum tier capital ratio of 
at december   the company had a risk based capital ratio of and tier capital ratio of 
this was compared to and for total risk based capital and tier capital  respectively  at december  the company currently exceeds the regulatory capital minimum requirements 
if the company were fully leveraged ie if the company were at the minimum risk based capital and tier capital ratios  further growth would be restricted to the level attainable through generation and retention of net income unless the company were to seek additional capital from outside sources 
year issues introduction 
the year creates challenges with respect to the automated systems used by financial institutions and other companies 
many software programs are not able to recognize the year  since most programs and systems were designed to store calendar years in the s by assuming the and storing only the last two digits of the year 
for example  these automated systems would recognize a year stored as as the year  rather than as the year 
if these automated systems are not appropriately re coded  updated or replaced before the year  they will likely confuse data  crash or fail in some manner 
in addition  many software programs and automated systems will fail to recognize the year as a leap year 
the problem is not limited to computer systems 
year issues will potentially affect every system that has an embedded microchip  such as automated teller machines  elevators and vaults 
the year challenge is especially problematic for financial institutions  since many transactions such as interest accruals and payments are date sensitive 
it also may affect the operations of third parties with whom the company does business  including the company s vendors  suppliers  utility companies and customers 
the company s state of readiness 
the company is committed to addressing these year challenges in a prompt and responsible manner and has dedicated resources to do so 
management has completed an assessment of its automated systems and has implemented a plan to resolve these issues  including purchasing appropriate computer technology 
the company s year compliance plan yk plan has five phases 
these phases are project management  awareness  assessment  testing  and renovation and implementation 
the company has substantially completed phases one through four  although appropriate follow up activities are continuing to occur  and the company is currently involved in the renovation and implementation phase of the yk plan 
project management 
the company has assigned primary responsibility for year project management to its vice president data processing 
the company has also formed a year compliance committee  consisting of appropriate representatives from its critical operational areas including each of the affiliate banks  to assist the vice president data processing in implementing the yk plan 
in addition  the company provides monthly reports to its board of directors and to the boards of directors of each of its subsidiaries in order to assist them in overseeing the company s year readiness 
awareness 
the company has completed several projects designed to promote awareness of year issues throughout our organization and our customer base 
these projects include communication through local seminars in each of the communities the company serves  mailing information brochures to deposit and loan customers  providing training for lending officers and other staff  and responding to vendor  customer  and shareholder inquiries 
assessment 
assessment is the process of identifying all mission critical applications that could potentially be negatively affected by dates in the year and beyond 
the company s assessment phase is substantially complete 
systems examined during this phase included telecommunications systems  account processing applications  and other software and hardware used in connection with customer accounts 
the company s operations  like those of many other companies  are intertwined with the operations of certain of its business partners 
accordingly  the company s operations could be materially affected if the operations of those companies who provide the company with mission critical applications  systems  and services are materially affected 
for example  the company depends upon vendors who provide equipment  technology  and software to it in connection with its business operations 
failure of these software vendors to achieve year readiness could substantially affect the operations of the company 
in addition  lawsuits and other financial challenges materially affecting the financial viability of these vendors could materially affect the company 
in response to this concern  the company has identified and contacted those vendors who provide our mission critical applications 
the company has assessed their year compliance efforts and will continue to monitor their progress as the year approaches 
testing 
updating and testing of the company s mission critical automated systems has been completed 
all mission critical systems were successfully tested to verify that dates in the year are being appropriately recognized and processed 
testing of renovations and new systems will continue throughout renovation and implementation 
this phase involves obtaining and implementing renovated software applications provided by our vendors 
as these applications are received and implemented  the company will test them for year compliance 
this phase also involves upgrading and replacing automated systems where appropriate and will continue throughout although this phase will be substantially complete before the end of  additional follow up activities may take place in the year and beyond 
estimated costs to address the company s year issues 
the total financial effect of these year challenges on the company cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
in fact  in spite of all efforts being made to rectify these problems  the success of these efforts cannot be predicted until the year actually arrives 
the company will upgrade or replace certain automated systems before the year  however some of these systems would have been replaced before the year without regard to year compliance issues  due to technology updates and company expansion 
in  the company established an accrual for year related costs incurred in of  this accrual was established for consulting costs associated with on going year efforts and equipment replacement 
management does not believe that expenses related to meeting the company s year challenges will have a material effect on the operations or financial performance of the company 
however  factors beyond the control of management  such as the effects on vendors of our mission critical software and systems  the effects of year issues on the economy  and the development of the risks identified below under the risks of the company s year issues  among other things  could have a material effect on the operations or financial performance of the company 
the risks of the company s year issues 
the year presents certain risks to the company and its operations 
some of these risks are present because the company purchases technology applications from other parties who face year challenges 
other of these risks are inherent in the business of banking or are risks faced by many companies with stock traded on a national stock exchange 
although it is impossible to identify every possible risk that the company may face moving into the new millennium  management has to date identified the following potential risks commercial banks  such as the company  may experience a contraction in their deposit base  if a significant amount of deposited funds are withdrawn by customers prior to the year  and interest rates may increase in the latter part of this potential deposit contraction could make it necessary for the company to change its sources of funding and could materially impact future earnings 
the company has incorporated a contingency plan for addressing this situation  should it occur  into its asset and liability management policies 
this plan includes maintaining the ability to borrow funds in an amount at least equal to of the company s allowed borrowing from the federal home loan bank of seattle 
significant demand for funds by other banks could reduce the amount of funds available for the company to borrow 
if insufficient funds are available from a federal home loan bank or other correspondents  the company may also sell investment securities or other liquid assets to meet liquidity needs 
despite these efforts  a significant deposit contraction could materially impact the company s earnings or future operations  particularly if funds availability at the federal home loan bank is impaired 
the company lends significant amounts to businesses in its market area 
if these businesses are adversely affected by year issues  their ability to repay loans could be impaired 
this increased credit risk could affect the company s financial performance 
during the assessment phase of the company s yk plan  significant borrowers were identified 
management is currently monitoring the year compliance efforts of these credit customers 
the company s operations  like those of many other companies  can be affected by the year triggered failures of other companies upon whom the company depends for the functioning of its automated systems 
accordingly  the company s operations could be materially affected  if the operations of those companies who provide the company with mission critical applications  systems  and services are materially affected 
as described previously  the company has identified its mission critical vendors and is monitoring their year compliance progress 
all companies with stock traded on a national stock exchange  including the company  could experience a drop in stock price as investors change their investment portfolios or sell stock prior to the new millennium 
at this time  it is impossible to predict whether or not this will in fact be the case with respect to the stock of the company or any other company 
the company s ability to operate effectively in the year could be affected by communications abilities and access to utilities  such as electricity  water  telephone  and others  to the extent access is interrupted due to the effects of year issues on these and other utilities 
the company s contingency plans 
the company has developed contingency plans related to year issues 
these plans range from obtaining mission critical system back up capabilities to funds management contingencies 
forward looking statements 
the previous discussion  entitled year issues  includes certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra 
this statement is included for the express purpose of availing the company of the protections of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra 
management s ability to predict results or effects of issues related to the year is inherently uncertain  and is subject to factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
factors that could affect the actual results include the possibility that protection procedures  contingency plans  and remediation efforts will not operate as intended  and the company s failure to timely or completely identify all software or hardware applications requiring remediation  unexpected costs  and the uncertainty associated with the impact of year issues on the banking industry and on the company s customers  vendors  and others with whom it does business 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview 
interest rate  credit  and operations risks are the most significant risks impacting the company s performance 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the company relies on loan reviews  prudent loan underwriting standards and an adequate reserve for loans loss to mitigate credit risk 
the company defines interest sensitivity or interest rate risk as the risk that the company s earnings or capital will change when interest rates change 
market  or economic risk  by comparison  is the risk that the value of the company s assets will change when interest rates change 
to ensure consistent measurement  the company has developed comprehensive asset and liability management policies that are followed by all affiliate banks 
exposure is the change in pre tax earnings  over a month period  when the fed funds rate changes 
leverage is the company s exposure calculated as a percent of capital and therefore is expressed in terms of a pre tax return on equity 
if the company s earnings move in the same direction as interest rates  then the company is asset sensitive ie interest income changes more than interest expense 
if the earnings move in the opposite direction from the change in rates  then the company is liability sensitive ie interest expense changes more than interest income 
calculation of interest rate risk 
a change in earnings as a result of changes in interest rates is caused by two factors 
first  the rate on each asset and liability changes by a different amount and at a different time 
second  there are different volumes of assets and liabilities maturing and repricing the traditional gap 
the combination causes a change in the company s net interest margin 
exposure calculation of interest rate risk the company will use change in earnings exposure as its primary measure of interest rate risk 
it is the policy of the company to control the exposure of the company s earnings to changing interest rates by generally maintaining a position within a reasonable range around an earnings neutral or balanced position 
this is defined as the mix of assets and liabilities that generate a net interest margin that is not affected by interest rate changes 
there are three reasons for establishing a target range rather than an exact earnings neutral position 
measuring interest rate risk is not an exact science 
we can only estimate the earnings impact of a change in rates  and this estimate may change as the rate environment changes this is often called basis risk 
also  the mix of assets and liabilities available in the company s market may not produce an exact earnings neutral position  thus forcing the company to forego good business opportunities if it must keep a totally balanced position 
lastly  a neutral position does not allow the company to modestly position itself to take advantage of a rising or falling rate trend ie keeping investments shorter when rates are rising 
there can be exceptions to this general rule 
if  for example  the company has a liquidity or capital problem then this takes priority and the company would employ a strategy that protects liquidity by maintaining an asset sensitive position ie having assets that will reprice quickly to reflect a change in interest rates 
this would keep assets at current rates to allow their sale  if needed  without recognizing a significant loss 
interest rate risk exposure leverage limits the company shall normally maintain a mix of assets and liabilities that produces interest rate risk that will change the company s net interest income over the next months less than the following limits  if the fed funds rate changes change in roe leverage asset sensitive liability sensitive there is a lower risk limit for liability sensitivity because  in a liability sensitive company  interest rate risk and market risk move in the same direction  thereby exaggerating the impact of changing rates 
if the company were asset sensitive  these two risks would tend to offset each other 
interest rate risk is calculated quarterly and reported to the asset liability management committee and then to the respective boards of directors 
significant changes in the structure of the company s finances can be modeled during the quarters to ensure continued compliance with these policy limits 
at no time during the year were these limitations exceeded 
inflation the primary impact of inflation on the company s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets  and if significant  would require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be necessary

as of december   the company had no securities classified as held to maturity 
actual maturities may differ for mortgage backed securities due to ability to prepay 
loan portfolio interest earned on the loan portfolio is the primary source of income for the company 
net loans and leases represented of total assets as of december  although the company strives to serve the credit needs of its service area  its primary focus is on real estate  commercial and consumer installment loans 
the company makes substantially all of its loans to customers located within the company s service area 
the company has no loans defined as highly leveraged transactions by the federal reserve bank  nor significant agricultural loans 
commercial real estate loans primarily include owner occupied commercial properties occupied by the proprietor of the business conducted on the premises  and income producing or farm properties 
the primary risks of such loans include loss of income of the owner or occupier of the property and the inability of the market to sustain rent levels 
the company s underwriting standards attempt to mitigate these risks by requiring a minimum of three consecutive years of sufficient income generation from the owner or occupier or rental incomes of times the combined debt service  insurance and taxes 
in addition  a loan to value ratio limitation is expected to provide sufficient protection against unforeseen circumstances 
other commercial loans include renewable operating lines of credit  short term notes  and equipment financing 
these types of loans are principally at risk due to insufficient business income 
accordingly  the company does not lend to start up businesses or others lacking operating history  and requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment 
residential real estate loans include family owner or non owner occupied residences  multi family units  construction and secondary market loans pending sale 
generally  the risk associated with such loans is the loss of the borrower s income 
the company attempts to mitigate the risk by thorough review of the borrower s credit and employment history  and limits the loan to value ratio to to provide protection in the event of foreclosure 
installment loans consist of personal  automobile or home equity loans 
the company also offers credit cards to its customers 
these unsecured loans carry significantly higher interest rates than secured loans  which allows the company to maintain a higher loss reserve in conjunction with maintaining strict credit guidelines when considering loan applications

collectively within this document  the consolidated entity is referred to as the company 
acquisition of pacific state bank in june  the company and pacific state bank psb announced a definitive agreement to merge in a stock for stock exchange 
the transaction  accounted for as a pooling of interests  was consummated on november   in an exchange of shares of sbhc common stock for each share of psb common stock 
there were  shares of sbhc common stock issued for  shares of psb common stock 
all prior period financial data has been restated to include psb 
the acquisition of psb was pursued due to their excellent historical financial performance  excessively strong capital levels and their geographic location 
psb is located on the oregon coast  approximately miles north of coos bay 
as such  it was a natural extension of the company s franchise of community banks 
psb s performance numbers both return on equity and return on assets will strengthen those of the overall company 
finally  the additional capital will enable the company to pursue other aspects of it s growth strategy 
results of operations the operating results of the company depends primarily on net interest income 
the company s net interest income is determined by interest rate spread  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net income is also affected by the establishment of provisions for loan losses and the level of its other income  including service charges on deposit accounts and sold real estate loan fees  as well as its other expenses and income tax provisions

net income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease 
the primary reason for the decrease in net income were merger related expense and an increase in esop compensation expense 
net interest income 
net interest income before the provision for loan losses increased million or for the year ended december  over the same period in the increase resulted from a million increase in interest income offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income is due primarily to an increase in average earning assets of million or for the year ended december   over the same period in although loans continued to increase during  new deposits at prevailing interest rates limited the increase in the net interest income 
interest expense increased due to both volume and rate for the comparable periods in over average interest bearing liabilities increased million or for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the weighted average yields earned were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
average yields earned decreased basis points or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in average rates paid were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of basis points or for the year ended december   compared to provision for loan loss 
the provision for loan loss increased during the year ended december  to  as compared to  for the same period in net charge offs during the years were  and  for and  respectively 
the reserve for loan losses was  at december   as compared to  at december  the company s ratio of reserve for loan losses to total loans was at december   compared to at december  non performing assets defined as loans on non accrual status  loans days or more past due  and other real estate owned were  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase in non performing assets is attributable to a small number of non performing loans secured by multiple family residential real estate 
management believes the loans are adequately secured and that no significant losses will be incurred 
management does not believe that the increase represents a deterioration of the credit quality of the loan portfolio or an indication of future credit problems 
non interest income 
non interest income increased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in in  the company had a nonrecurring sale of  of mortgage servicing rights  recognizing a gain of  service charges on deposit accounts were  in  compared to  in  a increase  resulting primarily from an increase in deposits 
mortgage loan origination s were million in the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in loans sold were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  generating  and  of sold loan fee income during each respective period  an increase of over a strong refinance market resulting from low interest rates  as well as expansion of security mortgage into the portland market supported mortgage origination activity 
merger related costs  comprised of professional fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of pacific state bank  were  for the year ended december esop compensation expense 
the company sponsors an employee stock ownership plan esop  a leveraged employee retirement benefit plan which owns approximately of the common stock of the company 
the esop owns  shares  of which  are allocated to plan participants 
the remaining  shares are unallocated  and will be allocated over the remaining debt service period 
the current esop debt of  is to be extinguished over the next six years  ending in as the debt is paid  shares are released for allocation 
the release of shares is comprised of shares released through dividends on allocated shares  and shares released through compensation expense a non cash charge to the income statement 
compensation expense is calculated by multiplying the shares released as compensation by the average share price of the company s common stock for the year 
two components of shareholders equity are also affected 
there is a reduction in unearned esop shares at cost  and an increase in surplus at the difference between the fair market value and the cost of the shares  thereby creating no impact on shareholders equity and off setting the compensation expense 
as shares are released  they are considered outstanding for the purposes of calculating earnings per share and book value per share 
in  the average share price was  a increase over the average price in of 
this significant price appreciation has caused the compensation charge to increase proportionately  well beyond the originally planned of eligible salaries 
the resulting non cash charge to earnings in of represented of eligible salaries  and the charge in of was of eligible salaries 
other non interest expense 
other non interest expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  primary reasons for the increase include a full year of operating expense for lincoln security bank noting lincoln s operations started may  increased salary and related benefits and increased furniture fixture costs relating to depreciation on new equipment 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the company s effective tax rate decreased resulting from a lower state tax rate for  and the removal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance  as it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable income 
loan losses and recoveries the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is based on the company s loan loss experience and such factors which  in management s judgment  deserve recognition in estimating possible loan losses 
management monitors the loan portfolio to ensure that the reserve for loan losses is adequate to cover outstanding loans on non accrual status and any current loans deemed to be in serious doubt of repayment according to each loan s repayment plan 
the following table summarizes the company s reserve for loan losses  and charge off and recovery activity year ended december  dollars in thousands loans outstanding at end of period   average loans outstanding during the period   reserve balance  beginning of period   recoveries commercial real estate installment credit card loans charged off commercial real estate installment credit card net loans charged off provision charged to operations reserve balance  end of period   ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding lending and credit management although a risk of nonpayment exists with respect to all loans  certain specific types of risks are associated with different types of loans 
due to the nature of the company s customer base and the growth experienced in coos  curry  lincoln and douglas counties  real estate is frequently a material component of collateral for the company s loans 
the expected source of repayment of these loans is generally the operations of the borrower s business or personal income  but real estate provides an additional measure of security 
risks associated with real estate loans include fluctuating land values  local economic conditions  changes in tax policies  and a concentration of loans within a limited geographic market area 
the company mitigates risk on construction loans by generally lending funds to customers that have been pre qualified for long term financing and who are using contractors acceptable to the company 
the commercial real estate risk is further mitigated by making the majority of commercial real estate loans on owner occupied properties 
the company manages the general risks inherent in the loan portfolio by following loan policies and underwriting practices designed to result in prudent lending activities 
for example  the company limits commercial loans to of the value of the collateral  and residential mortgages  which may be first or second liens  to of the value of the collateral 
residential loans with a loan to value greater than carry private mortgage insurance

allocation of reserve for loan losses the company does not normally allocate the reserve for loan losses to specific loan categories with the exception of credit cards 
an allocation by credit quality is made below for presentation purposes 
this allocation process does not necessarily measure anticipated future credit losses  rather  it seeks to measure the company s assessment at a point in time of perceived credit loss exposure and the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions
