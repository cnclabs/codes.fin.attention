the net credit resulted from a tax benefit of million and an after tax charge of million million before tax 
during the first quarter  several partners withdrew from csc enterprises 
these withdrawals caused csc enterprises to take actions which caused csc to recognize an increase in the tax basis of certain assets 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 this tax basis increase from the previous tax basis resulted in a deferred tax asset of million and a corresponding reduction in the company s provision for taxes 
the tax basis increase is temporary and will be realized over time through an increase in depreciation and amortization expense for income tax purposes 
in connection with the partner withdrawals and related developments  csc enterprises reviewed its operations  its market opportunities and the carrying value of its assets

the 
margin improvement to principally relates to lower depreciation and amortization as a percent of revenue in both the us federal and global commercial operations of the company

cash flows fiscal fiscal fiscal percent percent amount change amount change amount dollars in millions cash from operations net cash used in investing net cash provided by financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash at beginning of year cash at end of year historically  the majority of the company s cash has been provided from operating activities 
the increases in cash from operations during fiscal and are primarily due to higher earnings  non cash charges depreciation and amortization and lower net income tax payments  partially offset by increased working capital requirements 
the company s investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and software that support the company s expanding global commercial operations 
investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as subsequent upgrades  expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets 
the company s investments also include several acquisitions during fiscal through the acquisitions  individually or collectively  were not material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as described above  a majority of the company s capital investments have been funded by cash from operations 
during fiscal the company issued million of notes due in proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and  subsequent to year end  to repay the million notes due april liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at april   million at april  and million at march  during this period  the company s earnings have added substantially to equity

dollars in millions debt equity    total capitalization    debt to total capitalization during fiscal  the company increased its affiliates credit agreement from million to million to provide stand by support for commercial paper 
million was available for borrowing under this program  at the end of both fiscal and in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  cash balances  unused borrowing capacity and other financing activities 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
dividends and redemption it has been the company s policy to invest earnings in the growth of the company rather than distribute earnings as dividends 
this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to regular review by the board of directors 
on february   the board of directors redeemed the stock purchase rights  which had been issued under the stockholder rights plan  for one sixth of one cent per right 
the redemption was paid on april  year readiness disclosure since its inception  csc has dealt with ongoing significant changes in the information technology industry 
as a result  resources are constantly being employed to modify  upgrade and enhance systems and infrastructure on behalf of clients and for internal needs 
the year issue represents another one of these changes 
it is the result of computer systems that represent years as a two digit rather than a four digit field 
any of such systems that utilize date sensitive data may not properly recognize a date field of as the year  but as some other date  typically the year this could result in possible system failure  miscalculations  or data corruption  thereby affecting normal business activity 
the company has established a two phase program to ensure that its proprietary products  internal computer systems and facilities are year ready 
in order to launch this program  monitor progress and coordinate the company s year activities  the year assurance office was established with this charter and reports directly to the chairman  president  and chief executive officer 
the initial phase  which included planning  inventory and assessment  has been completed for all of the company s existing business 
the final phase  which consists of correction  testing  deployment and acceptance  is in process and is expected to be substantially completed during the company s quarter ending october  a very small percentage of the final phase activities may not be completed by october   as certain clients have not yet upgraded applications for which they are responsible  thereby delaying their move from a non year ready platform 
the company expects that its year preparation efforts will not have a material effect on its overall financial position or results of operations 
the company currently estimates that the total fiscal and operating costs associated with making its proprietary products  internal systems and infrastructure year ready  as well as estimates for contingency planning and monitoring  including the cost of company personnel diverted to year assignments  will total approximately million  of which approximately million had been incurred as of the end of fiscal in addition  the company currently estimates that related capital expenditures for fiscal and will be approximately million  of which approximately million had been incurred as of the end of fiscal the company s total current estimate for year compliance has increased by approximately million since the third quarter of fiscal due to revised remediation estimates in australia  some clients scheduling system changes later than originally planned  and increased estimates for contingency and crisis management planning 
some of these capital expenditures represent equipment replacements that have been or will be accelerated due to year issues 
the operating costs described above are generally not incremental  but reflect the reallocation of existing resources 
the company has not deferred any significant information technology projects as a result of the year efforts 
as of the end of fiscal  a the company had completed approximately of items it has identified as necessary to be year ready  including activities to correct year issues  contingency planning and ancillary efforts and b the company had completed approximately of items it has identified as necessary to correct critical year items 
the company has completed an assessment of its obligations and responsibilities to its customers in respect of year issues arising from contractual engagements for computer goods and services  including obligations arising from the licensing of the company s proprietary software products 
as a result of this assessment  it is management s opinion that these obligations will not have a material effect on the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its crucial suppliers to determine whether they are or will be year ready 
by october   the company expects to have identified and replaced any such suppliers that will not be year ready 
the company is also contacting property owners to determine the readiness of its leased facilities with respect to facility infrastructure systems 
as of the end of fiscal  over of the company s crucial suppliers  property owners  and landlords have been determined to have adequate programs in place to be year ready before the end of evaluation of the remaining should be completed by october  in the opinion of the company s management  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario includes the possibility that the company and or its crucial suppliers are unable to complete their year readiness efforts prior to the onset of failures  the effects of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company could also be impacted materially by any significant economic  financial market or infrastructure disruption attributable to the year issue 
the company has developed initial drafts of year transition  contingency and crisis management plans 
final drafts will be completed during the quarter ending october  these plans include the use of exercises and drills with various relevant scenarios 
as a result of lessons learned from the exercises  the contingency plans may be modified 
the company has also established the infrastructure for a year corporate command center that will be fully operational during november this command center will be linked to each business unit s year crisis management center  which will be connected to internal and client support help desks 
euro conversion on january  the euro currency was introduced in of the member countries in the european union 
although euro notes and coins will not be available until the latter part of the transition period in  the euro is traded on the currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the company established a european steering group during to determine the company s approach to the euro and to develop plans to ensure that customer expectations and statutory requirements are met 
the company was ready by january  to deal with any customer or supplier who wished to transact in euros and all european intercompany transactions since january have been invoiced and settled in euros 
the company s european group plans to implement infrastructure during calendar which will provide all the internal systems functionality required to deal with the euro during the transition period and thereafter 
the transition period lasts until july when the national currencies will no longer be legal tender 
the incremental system cost to csc of introducing the euro will not be material 
the company does not believe that the introduction of the euro will negatively impact the enforceability of client contracts or require it to incur any material cost thereunder for which it will not be paid 
csc will continue to review the impact of the euro conversion during the transition period  but does not expect it to have a material impact on its overall financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company has fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings  fair value  or cash flows 
foreign currency during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these transactions by ensuring costs to service contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received 
short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
by matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
if necessary  the company may also use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions 
the company does not foresee changing its foreign currency exposure management strategy 
during fiscal  of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical ten percent increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by or million  while a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would not have a material impact on the company s net income 
the company s primary unhedged assets and liabilities consist of local currency cash balances and borrowings  respectively 
at april   the company had approximately million of non us dollar denominated cash and short term investments  and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
