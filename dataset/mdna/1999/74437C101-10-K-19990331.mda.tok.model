general we are a leading global provider of internet access services and related products to businesses 
we derive the majority of our revenues from providing dedicated and dial up internet access services to business customers and other isps in of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in the united states and in of the largest global telecommunications markets 
business customers are typically signed to contracts that range from one to three years 
revenues generated from business customers typically comprise recurring monthly fees  installation and start up charges and sales of related equipment and services 
revenues from isps are generated pursuant to network access agreements which typically require a minimum number of subscribers and obligate the isps to pay specified monthly fees for each subscriber using the psinet network 
we also offer  in addition to internet connectivity services  products and services to businesses that enable them to maximize utilization of the internet in their day to day operations in and outside of their workplaces 
some of these value added services include corporate intranets  web hosting services that permit customers to market themselves on the internet without having to invest significantly in technology infrastructure and operations staff  remote user access services that permit customers to allow their mobile personnel to access their corporate network and systems resources in countries using the internet  multi currency electronic commerce services  security services  and other advanced ip based applications such as voice over internet as opposed to standard telephone services and internet fax 
revenues from value added services are typically in the form of monthly fees and are often bundled with internet access services 
as a key component of our growth strategy  we acquired isps in nine of the largest global telecommunications markets over the month period ended december  the aggregate amount of the purchase prices and related payments for these acquisitions was approximately million  exclusive of indebtedness assumed in connection with such acquisitions 
of such aggregate amount  we have paid million to the sellers as of december   and have retained million to secure performance by certain sellers of indemnification and other contractual obligations 
we currently have operations in of the largest international telecommunications markets 
in addition to the united states  we have operations in africa  belgium  canada  france  germany  hong kong  italy  japan  the netherlands  republic of korea  switzerland and the united kingdom 
we typically enter a new market through the acquisition of an existing company within the particular market 
revenue from non us operations continues to increase as a percentage of consolidated results  comprising of revenue in the fourth quarter of and for all of by comparison  non us operations comprised of revenue in the fourth quarter of and for all of since the commencement of our operations  we have undertaken a program of developing and expanding our data communications network 
in connection with this program  we have made significant investments in telecommunications circuits and equipment to produce a geographically dispersed  atm  isdn and smds compatible frame relay network specially designed to optimize internet traffic 
these investments generally are made in advance of obtaining customers and resulting revenue 
as part of our ongoing efforts to further expand and enhance our network  we have acquired or agreed to acquire significant amounts of global fiber based telecommunications bandwidth  including irus or other rights in 
 equivalent route miles of oc capacity across the united states  
stm transatlantic capacity connecting the united states  the united kingdom and continental europe  
ten dark fiber optic strands connecting the new york city and washington  dc metropolitan areas and major metropolitan areas in between  and four strands each within new york and washington  dc  
six ds s of transpacific capacity connecting the united states and japan  
four dark fiber optic strands connecting multiple locations in the san francisco bay area  
stm network bandwidth having the capability of connecting japan  china  southeast asia  india  the middle east  europe and the united kingdom  
stm network bandwidth inter connecting european cities  and 
dark fiber optic strands connecting the vancouver  british columbia and seattle  washington metropolitan areas 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement with other leading global telecommunications companies to build the japan us cable network 
the acquisition of these telecommunications bandwidth assets is expected to increase our network capacity by a substantial magnitude and to reduce significantly our future data communications and operations costs per equivalent mile 
in addition  the increased network capacity is expected to enable us to offer a wider variety of higher speed internet and internet related services to a larger customer base 
as a result  we anticipate that our data communications and operations costs as a percentage of revenue will decrease as we substitute the acquired bandwidth for existing leased circuit arrangements with various telecommunications carriers 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  results of operations revenue 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of internet access and related services to businesses 
revenue was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in 
the revenue growth is broken down into from those operations that were in existence at the end of and from the companies we acquired in our organic growth is attributable to a number of factors  including an increase in the number of business customer and isp accounts  an increase in the average annual revenue realized per new business customer account  and an increase in the business account retention rate 
our business customer account base increased by to  business accounts at the end of from  business accounts at the end of of the total business account growth in   business accounts resulted from organic growth and  business accounts were attributable to the companies we acquired 
the total number of our carrier and isp customers grew to  serving  small office home office soho consumer customers at the end of  from isps serving  soho consumer customers at the end of average annual new contract value for business accounts increased to  in from  in  which we believe reflects an increasing demand for value added services and higher levels of bandwidth 
our business account retention rate improved to in from in data communications and operations 
data communications and operations expenses consist primarily of leased long distance and local circuit costs as well as personnel and related operating expenses associated with network operations  customer support and field service 
data communications and operations expenses were million of revenue for  an increase of million from million of revenue for the increase in expenses related principally to increases in the number of leased long distance  dedicated customer and dial up circuits  expenditures for additional pris to support the growth of our carrier and isp services business  personnel costs resulting from the expansion of our network opertions  customer support and field service staff  including through acquisitions  and operating and maintenance charges on telecommunications bandwidth 
our dedicated customer account base grew to  at december  from  at december   an increase of 
comparing to  backbone circuit costs increased million or  dedicated customer circuit costs increased million or  pri expense increased million or  and personnel and related operating expenses associated with network operations  customer support and field service increased million or 
circuit costs relating to our new and expanded points of presence and primary rate interfaces generally are incurred by us in advance of obtaining customers and resulting revenue 
although we expect that data communications and operations expenses will continue to increase as our customer base grows  we anticipate that such expenses will decrease over time as a percentage of revenue due to decreases in unit costs and continued increases in network utilization 
in particular  we anticipate that costs for data communications and operations as a percentage of revenue will decrease as we substitute network bandwidth purchased or acquired under capital lease agreements for existing bandwidth currently under operating lease agreements 
network bandwidth purchased or acquired under capital lease agreements is recorded as an asset and amortized over its useful life 
this will  in turn  result in increases in depreciation and amortization expense over the useful life of the bandwidth  typically to years 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  distribution costs and related occupancy costs 
sales and marketing expenses were million of revenue for  an increase of million from million of revenue for the increase is principally attributable to costs related to a branding and advertising campaign resulting in additional advertising expense of million and from costs associated with the growth of our sales force in conjunction with our growth and acquisitions 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and occupancy costs for executive  financial  legal and administrative personnel and provision for uncollectible accounts receivable 
general and administrative expenses were million of revenue for  an increase of million from million of revenue for the increase resulted from the addition of management staff and related operating expenses across the organization  including increases in conjunction with our growth and acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization costs were million of revenue for  an increase of million from million of revenue for depreciation and amortization costs have increased as a result of capital expenditures associated with network infrastructure enhancements  including telecommunications bandwidth acquisitions  and depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets related to business acquisitions 
we anticipate that our depreciation and amortization expenses will continue to increase significantly as we substitute network bandwidth purchased or acquired under capital lease agreements for existing bandwidth under operating lease agreements  and as we record depreciation and amortization on tangible and intangible assets related to business combinations and expansion of our operations 
acquired in process research and development 
the results for include million of revenue in charges for acquired in process research and development 
the charges were based on independent valuations and reflect technologies acquired prior to technological feasibility and for which there was no alternative future use 
the technologies exist at eight of the companies we acquired  specifically istar  inx  ionet  linkage  interlog  rimnet  inet  and tokyo internet  comprising approximately of the total fair value of assets acquired 
we have included a detailed description of the specific technologies acquired  their value  cost to complete  expected completion date and remaining tasks in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this form k 
the value of the in process projects was adjusted to reflect the relative value and contribution of the acquired research and development 
in doing so  we gave consideration to the stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred  and the projected cost to complete the projects 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was based on key assumptions that included 
estimated revenue associated with the respective business enterprise valuations assuming five year compound annual revenue growth rates of between and 

revenue growth rates for each technology considering  among other things  current and expected industry trends  acceptance of the technologies and historical growth rates for similar industry products 
estimated revenues from the purchased in process technology projects were generally assumed to peak in the year and decline through or earlier as other new products are expected to be introduced 
these revenue projections were based on management s estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions 

estimated net cash flows discounted back to their present value using a discount rate of between and  which represents a premium to our cost of capital 

estimated percentage of completion of the various in process research and development projects ranged from to complete 
if none of these projects is successfully developed  the company s sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
however  the failure of any particular individual project in process would not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or its results of operations 
the failure of any particular individual project in process could impair the value of other intangible assets acquired 
there were no comparable charges in interest expense 
interest expense was million for  an increase of million from million for the increase was due to interest on our issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in april and our issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in november  as well as to increased borrowings and capital lease obligations incurred to finance our network expansion and to fund our working capital requirements 
interest income 
interest income was million for  an increase of million from million for the increase was due to interest received on the net proceeds of our offerings of the senior notes and senior notes  which we invest in short term investment grade and government securities until such time as we use them for other purposes 
other income  net 
other income  net  was million for  which primarily relates to a million realized gain on equity securities that we sold during the third quarter 
the total of million in primarily related to the sale in the first quarter of of our software subsidiary 
non recurring arbitration charge 
the results for include a million charge for an arbitration award and related costs associated with a dispute between psinet and chatterjee management company 
the charge relates to a joint venture agreement executed by the parties in and there is no ongoing relationship between the companies 
there were no similar charges in see legal proceedings in part i  item of this form k 
net loss available to common shareholders and loss per share 
our net loss available to common shareholders for was million  or basic and diluted loss per share  a million increase from a net loss available to common shareholders for of million  or basic and diluted loss per share 
the primary reasons for the increase were operating losses of acquired companies  the increase in data communications costs  the first portions of our acquired irus were installed  leading to an increase in depreciation and personnel costs to manage the irus  the charge for acquired in process research and development relating to acquisitions in  the increase in interest expense due to the issuance of the senior notes and senior notes  and the costs of the non recurring arbitration charge 
the return to preferred shareholders  which comprises the dividends with respect to our series b convertible preferred stock and accretion of the related conversion premium  is subtracted from net loss in determining the net loss available to common shareholders 
because inclusion of common stock equivalents is antidilutive  basic and diluted loss per share are the same for each period presented 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  results of operations revenue 
revenue was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase was attributable to a number of factors  including an increase in the number of business customer and isp accounts  an increase in the average annual revenue realized per new business customer account and an increase in sales by our international subsidiaries 
the growth was driven by an expansion of our sales force and greater public awareness and utilization of the internet 
in comparison with  revenue for was affected by the sale in of our individual consumer accounts and related assets and by the sale in of our software subsidiary  which together provided million of revenue in but only million in if such revenue was excluded from revenue  our growth in revenue from to would have been instead of 
revenue growth in was also impacted by a drop in our annualized business customer retention rate from in to in  which was attributable in part to an initiative by us to remove certain non performing accounts 
our business customer account base increased by to  business accounts at december   including isps  from  business accounts  including isps  at december  our revenue from international operations increased by to million in from million in  principally as a result of significant growth in our operations in the united kingdom  japan and canada 
other income  net 
we did not have other income  net  in  compared with million during  consisting of the consideration received  net of related asset costs and expenses  relating to the sale of our individual consumer subscribers and certain related tangible and intangible assets during the second and third quarters of data communications and operations 
data communications and operations expenses were million of revenue during  an increase of million from million of revenue during the increase in expenses related principally to increases in the number of leased long distance  dedicated customer and dial up circuits  expenditures for additional primary rate interfaces to support the growth of our carrier and isp services business  and personnel costs resulting from the expansion of our network operations  customer support and field service staff 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million of revenue during  a decrease of million from million of revenue during the decrease resulted principally from reductions in costs following the sale of our individual consumer subscribers and related infrastructure in and the sale of our software operations in  which were offset in part by an increase in sales and marketing expenses relating to the expansion of our operations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million of revenue during  an increase of million from million of revenue during the increase resulted from the addition of management staff and related operating expenses across the organization  including in conjunction with our expansion outside of the united states  and increases in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
these expenses were in part offset by decreased expenses following the sale of our individual consumer subscribers and related assets in and the sale of our software operations in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization costs were million of revenue during  an increase of million from million of revenue during depreciation costs increased due to additional capital expenditures associated with network infrastructure enhancements  which were partially offset by decreases in costs resulting from the elimination of depreciation and amortization that had been associated with the individual consumer subscriber assets sold in and the software assets sold in interest expense 
interest expense was million during  an increase of million from million in the increase was principally due to increased borrowings and capital lease obligations incurred by us to finance network expansion and to fund working capital requirements 
interest income 
interest income was million during  a decrease of million from million in the decrease was principally due to a reduction in the amount of cash and short term  interest bearing investments held by us 
other income  net 
other income  net  was million for  which primarily related to the sale in the first quarter of of our software subsidiary 
net loss available to common shareholders and loss per share 
as a result of the factors discussed above  our net loss available to common shareholders for was million of revenue  or basic and diluted loss per share  a million improvement from a net loss available to common shareholders in of million of revenue  or basic and diluted loss per share 
the return to preferred shareholders  which comprises the dividends with respect to our series b convertible preferred stock and accretion of the related conversion premium  is subtracted from net loss in determining the net loss available to common shareholders 
because inclusion of common stock equivalents is antidilutive  basic and diluted loss per share are the same for each year presented 
income taxes in  we generated a pretax us book loss of approximately million and pretax non us book loss of approximately million 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for us income tax purposes 
the use of the us net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations under the rules regarding a change in stock ownership as determined by the internal revenue code 
these net operating loss carryforwards may be carried forward in varying amounts until additionally  at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes in various jurisdictions outside the united states amounting to approximately million 
the majority of non us loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts in to some of the non us loss carryforwards will never expire under local country tax rules 
we have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets since realization of these benefits cannot be reasonably assured 
the change in valuation allowance was an increase of million and million in and  respectively 
we recognized deferred income tax benefits of million in  million in  and million in  resulting primarily from deferred tax liabilities of companies we acquired outside of the us 
we did not recognize any current income tax expense or benefit for any of those three years 
segment information we offer a broad range of internet access services and related products to businesses in the us and throughout the world 
as of december   we served primary markets in countries  with operations organized into four geographic operating segments the us  canada  europe and asia 
in measuring performance and allocating assets  our chief operating officer reviews each geographic operating segment as a whole and not by types of services provided 
we evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources to them based on revenue and ebitda 
we define ebitda as losses before interest expense and interest income  taxes  depreciation and amortization  other non operating income and expense  and charge for acquired in process research and development 
all our reportable segments have experienced significant revenue increases from to between and  our revenue growth by segment was largely organic  with the united states growing by  canada by  europe by and asia by 
starting in late and through  we acquired isps in the us  canada  europe and asia  and our revenue growth between and reflects a mixture of organic and acquired revenue 
revenue growth by segment between these years is as follows organic acquired total united states canada europe asia all segments ebitda losses as a percentage or revenue improved in all segments except the us from to  reflecting the overall development cycle of our businesses in these areas 
in the us  our ebitda loss as a percentage of revenue increased from to  which is reflective of increased costs charged to the us segment relating to shared network  marketing and general and administrative costs not allocated to other reportable segments 
improvements in ebitda as percentage of revenue for the canadian segment was to  for the european segment was to  and for the asian segment was to 
these improvements have arisen as a result of two primary factors 
first  improvements have been generated based on organic growth factors including high levels of revenue growth and concentration of efforts on controlling operating costs  and second  almost every company we acquired in operated at ebitda breakeven or better  contributing to these improvements 
ebitda losses as a percentage of revenue improved in all segments from to in the us  it went from to  in canada from  to  in europe from to  and in asia from to 
the improvement in the us reflects revenue that increased at a faster rate than did data communications and operations  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
we achieved cost reductions between and in the us due to the disposition of our software operations 
our operating improvements outside of the us primarily are the result of the development of these operations that were largely still in a start up mode in our loss from operations differs from ebitda only by depreciation and amortization  and the charge for acquired in process research and development  therefore  loss from operations in each segment reflects underlying trends as those impacting ebitda as a percentage of revenue 
however  as a result of our acquisitions of telecommunications bandwidth and other fixed assets and acquisitions of isps  we incurred charges for acquired in process research and development and increased depreciation and amortization expenses in each geographic segment  which increased our loss from operations 
in the us  our loss from operations as a percentage of revenue went from in to in to in in canada  it went from  to to  in europe from to to  and in asia from to to for those same three years  respectively

the timing of acquisitions 
the success of our efforts to expand our customer base  and to sell enhanced and value added services to existing customers  
changes in and the timing of expenditures relating to the continued expansion of our network  
the delivery of bandwidth from our global network providers  
the development of new services  and 
changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors 
in view of the significant historical growth of our operations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance and that we may experience significant period to period fluctuations in operating results in the future 
we expect to focus in the near term on building and increasing our customer base and increasing our network utilization both through internal growth and through acquisitions which may require us from time to time to increase our expenditures for personnel  marketing  network infrastructure and the development of new services 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically had losses from operations  which have been funded primarily through borrowings and capital lease financings from vendors  financial institutions and other third parties  and through the issuance of debt and equity securities 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately  million from debt financings 
cash flows for the years ended december   and cash flows used in operating activities were million in  million in and million in cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of operating cash receipts and payments  especially accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
in all three years  our net losses were the primary component of cash used in operating activities  offset by significant non cash depreciation and amortization expenses relating to our network and intangible assets and  in  our charge for acquired in process research and development 
cash flows used in investing activities were million for  million for and million for acquisition activities resulted in the use of million of cash for  net of cash acquired 
investments in our network and facilities during resulted in total additions to fixed assets of million 
of this amount  million was financed under vendor or other financing arrangements  million of non cash additions related to the bandwidth acquired from ixc  million related to other network facilities that remained in accounts payable at year end  and million was expended in cash 
for  total additions were million  of which million was financed under equipment financing agreements and million was expended in cash  and for  additions were million  with million financed and million expended in cash 
purchases of short term investments with the proceeds of our senior notes and senior notes offerings during were an aggregate of million  offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of short term investments of million 
investing cash flows in and were reduced by million and million  respectively  from increases in restricted cash and short term investments related to various financing alternatives 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million for  million for  and million for in  and  we received net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable of  million  million and million  respectively 
in  we completed a private placement of  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of million 
in  and  we made repayments aggregating million  million  and million  respectively  on our capital lease obligations and notes payable 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  short term investments and marketable securities 
capital structure our capital structure at december  consisted of a revolving credit facility  other lines of credit  capital lease obligations  senior notes  senior notes  preferred stock and common stock 
total borrowings at december  were  million  which included million in current obligations and  million in long term capital lease obligations and notes payable 
we also had million of letters of credit outstanding as of december  as of that date  the aggregate unused portion under our various financing arrangements for purchases of equipment and other fixed assets was million  after designating million of payables for various equipment purchases 
our total us borrowings at december  were  million  comprising million of senior notes  million of capital leases and million of other notes 
the majority of our us debt was added through the issuance of our senior notes and senior notes in april and november  respectively 
total non us borrowings at december  were million  comprising million of capital leases and million of other notes 
the majority of our non us debt was added through our acquisitions completed in and is secured by specific telecommunications assets and letters of credit 
in  we expect to make interest payments on our and senior notes and payments on our capital leases and other notes payable of million in the aggregate 
in september  we entered into a new three year senior secured revolving credit facility to replace our existing bank credit arrangements in the united states 
the revolving credit facility expires on september  and has an aggregate principal amount of million  of which no amounts were outstanding and million was available to draw at december  our bank financing arrangements in the us  which are secured by substantially all of our assets  require us to satisfy many financial covenants such as those relating to consolidated revenue  leverage  liquidity and ebitda as defined therein  and prohibit us from paying cash dividends and repurchasing our capital stock without the lender s consent 
in particular  we are prohibited from permitting 
consolidated revenue for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than million during the six month period beginning december   million during the six month period beginning june   million during the six month period beginning december   million during the six month period beginning june   and million on december  and thereafter

in april  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and in november we completed offerings of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the aggregate net proceeds of these offerings  after giving effect to discounts  commissions  premiums and expenses and the establishment of an initial million escrow arrangement to fund when due the first five interest payments on our senior notes  were million 
the indentures governing the senior notes and the senior notes contain many covenants with which we must comply relating to  among other things  the following matters 
a limitation on our payment of cash dividends  repurchase of capital stock  payment of principal on subordinated indebtedness and making of certain investments  unless after giving effect to each such payment  repurchase or investment  certain operating cash flow coverage tests are met  excluding permitted payments and investments  
a limitation on our incurrence and our subsidiaries incurrence of additional indebtedness  unless at the time of such incurrence  our ratio of debt to annualized operating cash flow would be less than or equal to to prior to april  and less than or equal to to on or after april   excluding permitted incurrences of debt  
a limitation on our incurrence and our subsidiaries incurrence of liens  unless the senior notes and the senior notes are secured equally and ratably with the obligation or liability secured by such lien  excluding permitted liens  
a limitation on the ability of any of our subsidiaries to create or otherwise cause to exist any encumbrance or restriction on the payment of dividends or other distributions on their capital stock  payment of indebtedness owed to us or to any of our other subsidiaries  making of investments in us or in any of our other subsidiaries  or transfer of any of their properties or assets to us or any of our other subsidiaries  excluding certain permitted encumbrances and restrictions  
a limitation on certain mergers  consolidations and sales of assets by us or our subsidiaries  
a limitation on transactions with our affiliates  
a limitation on the ability of any of our subsidiaries to guarantee or otherwise become liable with respect to any of our indebtedness unless such subsidiary provides for a guarantee of the senior notes and the senior notes on the same terms as the guarantee of such indebtedness  
a limitation on sale and leaseback transactions by us or our subsidiaries  limitation on issuances and sales of capital stock of our subsidiaries  and 
a limitation on the ability of us or our subsidiaries to engage in any business not substantially related to a telecommunications business 
at december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
in november  we completed a private placement of  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of million 
during the first quarter of  all outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock  which accrued dividends at an annual rate of  were converted into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
as a result of this conversion  we are no longer required to pay the annual dividends under the terms of the series b preferred stock  resulting in the elimination of approximately million in annual dividend expense 
commitments  capital expenditures and future financing requirements as of december   we had commitments to certain telecommunications vendors totaling million payable in various years through additionally  we have various agreements to lease office space and facilities and  as of december   were obligated to make future minimum lease payments of million on non cancellable operating leases expiring in various years through for some of the acquisitions made in  we have retained a portion of the purchase price under hold back provisions of the purchase agreements to secure performance by certain sellers of indemnification or other contractual obligations of the sellers 
these acquisition hold back liabilities are generally payable up to months after the date of closing of the respective acquisitions 
acquisition hold back liabilities total million at december  in addition  the purchase price relating to one acquisition may be increased by up to million pursuant to an earnout provision in the event the acquired company achieved certain levels of operating results in the period following the acquisition 
this amount will be recorded as additional cost of the acquired company and reflected as additional purchased goodwill if it becomes probable that the amount will be paid 
at december   no amounts have been accrued since the final outcome of the earnout provision was not determinable 
in connection with our recently announced year commercial relationship with the baltimore ravens of the national football league  we acquired  among other things  rights to name the ravens nfl stadium psinet stadium as well as rights for sponsorship and promotion of team events and related advertising and marketing rights 
in addition  we have the right to develop a baltimore ravens web site and provide related internet services to subscribing fan members which  along with other commercial aspects of the transaction  are expected to bring revenues to both organizations through service and membership fees  e commerce and promotional ventures 
in exchange for all of these rights  we will make payments to the baltimore ravens over a year period 
we paid million in january  which includes a one time prepayment of million under the stadium naming rights agreement 
annual payments for and for the years thereafter start at million  with successive annual increases of approximately 
we expect that the total payments to be made over the year period will be approximately million 
in connection with the non recurring arbitration charge  we have recorded an accrual of million for the award and related costs  which could be paid in from available cash 
we acquire fiber based telecommunications bandwidth through purchases and capital leases 
some of the purchase agreements have obligations for future cash payments that coincide with the delivery of bandwidth 
at december   we were obligated to make future payments under these purchase agreements that total million  most which will be paid in we expect to continue to seek opportunities to acquire fiber based telecommunications bandwidth to enhance our global network capabilities 
in addition to the us and canada  we anticipate that such bandwidth acquisitions will be in europe and asia and would be accompanied by capital expenditures in the deployment of high activity points of presence designed and located with the objective of optimizing the efficient use of the bandwidth 
we currently anticipate that these expenditures in will be consistent with those in and will be financed through a combination of capital leases  existing working capital and other sources of financing 
we presently believe  based on the flexibility we expect to have in the timing of orders of bandwidth  in outfitting our points of presence with appropriate telecommunications and computer equipment  and in controlling the pace and scope of our anticipated buildout of our international internet network  that we will have a reasonable degree of flexibility to adjust the amount and timing of such capital expenditures in response to our then existing financing capabilities  market conditions  competition and other factors 
accordingly  we believe that working capital generated from the use of acquired bandwidth  together with other existing working capital  from existing credit facilities  from capital lease financings  and from future equity or debt financings  which we presently expect to be able to obtain when needed  will be sufficient to meet the currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements of our operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will have access to sufficient additional capital and or financing on satisfactory terms to enable us to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
other possible strategic relationships and acquisitions we anticipate that we will continue to seek to develop relationships with strategic partners  both domestically and internationally  and to acquire assets  including  without limitation  additional telecommunications bandwidth  and businesses principally relating to or complementary to our existing business 
certain of these strategic relationships may involve other telecommunications companies that desire to enter into joint marketing and services arrangements with us pursuant to which we would provide internet and internet related services to such companies 
such transactions  if deemed appropriate by us  may also be effected in conjunction with an equity or debt investment by such companies in us 
such relationships and acquisitions may require additional financing and may be subject to the consent of our lenders and other third parties 
we have not entered into any material financial instruments to serve as hedges against certain financial and currency risks or for trading 
however  as a result of the recent increase in our foreign operations  we may begin to use various financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  in the ordinary course of business  for purposes other than trading 
these instruments could include letters of credit  guarantees of debt  interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts relating to intercompany payables of foreign subsidiaries 
we do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange contracts would be used to mitigate foreign currency exposure and with the intent of protecting the us dollar value of certain currency positions and future foreign currency transactions 
interest rate swap agreements would be used to reduce our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
by their nature  all such instruments would involve risk  including the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
we would attempt to control our exposure to counterparty credit risk through monitoring procedures and by entering into multiple contracts 
risks associated with year the commonly referred to year yk problem results from the fact that many existing computer programs and systems use only two digits to identify the year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of a change in the century designation 
if not corrected  computer applications that use a two digit format could fail or create erroneous results in any computer calculation or other processing involving the year or a later date 
we have identified two main areas of yk risk 
internal computer systems or embedded chips could be disrupted or fail  causing an interruption or decrease in productivity in our operations  and 
computer systems or embedded chips of third parties  including  without limitation  financial institutions  suppliers  vendors  landlords  customers  international suppliers of telecommunications services and others could be disrupted or fail  causing an interruption or decrease in our ability to continue our operations 
we have developed plans for implementing  testing and completing any necessary modifications to our key computer systems and equipment with embedded chips to ensure that they are yk compliant 
we have engaged a third party consultant to perform an assessment of our us internal systems us  accounting  billing  customer support and network operations to determine the status of their yk compliance 
the assessment of these systems has been completed and  while some minor changes are necessary  we believe that no material changes or modifications to our internal systems are required to achieve yk compliance 
our us chief information officer has developed a test bed of our us internal systems to implement and complete testing of the requisite minor changes 
we anticipate that our us internal systems will be yk ready by june  we are in the process of completing an inventory of our internal systems that we use in canada  united kingdom  europe and asia to determine the status of their yk compliance 
each international office has in place to test  upgrade or  if necessary  replace components of its internal systems to ensure they are yk compliant 
we anticipate that our international operations will be yk compliant by the end of the third quarter of to help ensure that our network operations and services to our customers are not interrupted due to the yk problem  we have established a network operations team that meets weekly to examine our network on a worldwide basis 
this team of operational staff have conducted inventories of our network equipment software and hardware and have found no material yk compliance issues 
we believe that all equipment currently being purchased for use in the psinet network is yk compliant 
any existing equipment that is not yk compliant is planned to be made yk compliant through minor changes to the software or hardware or  in limited instances  replacement of the equipment 
we anticipate that our network will be yk compliant by the end of the second quarter of in addition to administering the implementation of necessary upgrades for yk compliance  our network team is developing a contingency plan to address any potential problems that may occur with our network as we enter the year we believe that  as a result of our detailed assessment and completed modifications  the yk issue will not pose significant operational problems for us 
however  if the requisite modifications and conversions are not made  or not completed in a timely fashion  it is possible that the yk problem could have a material impact on our operations 
our cost of addressing yk issues has been minor to date  less than of our information technology and network operations budgets  but this amount may increase if additional outside consultants or personnel resources are required or if important operational equipment must be remediated or replaced 
our estimated total costs related to yk issues for is not expected to exceed million 
these costs include equipment  consulting fees  software and hardware upgrades  testing  remediation and  in limited instances  replacement of equipment 
the risk that yk issues could present to us include  without limitation  disruption  delay or cessation of operations  including operations that are subject to regulatory compliance 
in each case  the correction of the problem could result in substantial expense and disruption or delay of our operations 
the total cost of yk assessments and remediation is funded through cash on hand and available from other sources and we are expensing these costs  as appropriate 
the financial impact of making all required systems changes or other remediation efforts cannot be known precisely  but it is not expected to be material to our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we have not canceled any principal information technology projects as a result of our yk effort  although we have rescheduled some internal tasks to accommodate this effort 
in addition  we have identified  prioritized and are communicating with our suppliers  vendors  customers  lenders and other material third parties to determine their yk status and any probable impact on us 
to date  our inquiries have not revealed any significant yk noncompliance issue affecting our material third parties 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate our long term relationships with our material third parties based on their responses to our inquiries and on information learned from other sources 
if any of our material third parties are not yk ready and their non compliance causes a material disruption to any of their respective businesses  our business could be materially adversely affected 
disruptions could include  among other things 
the failure of a material third party s business  
a financial institution s inability to take and transfer funds  
an interruption in delivery of supplies from vendors  
a loss of voice and data connections  
a loss of power to our facilities  and 
other interruptions in the normal course of our operations  the nature and extent of which we cannot foresee 
we will continue to evaluate the nature of these risks  but at this time we are unable to determine the probability that any such risk will occur  or if it does occur  what the nature  length or other effects  if any  it may have on us 
if a significant number of our material third parties experience failures in their computer systems or operations due to yk non compliance  it could affect our ability to process transactions or otherwise engage in similar normal business activities 
for example  while we expect our internal systems  us and us  to be yk ready in stages during  we and our customers who communicate internationally will be dependent upon the yk readiness of many non us providers of telecommunication services and their vendors and suppliers 
if these providers and others are not yk ready  we and our customers will not be able to send and receive data and other electronic transmissions  which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and business and that of our customers 
while many of these risks are outside our control  we have identified and contacted our critical third party vendors and suppliers and are establishing contingency plans to remedy any potential interruption to our operations 
while we believe that we are adequately addressing the yk issue  we can not assure that our yk compliance effort will prevent every potential interruption or that the cost and liabilities associated with the yk issue will not materially adversely impact our business  prospects  revenues or financial position 
we are uncertain as to our most reasonably likely worst case yk scenario and have not yet completed a contingency plan to handle a worst case scenario 
we expect to have such contingency plan in place by september  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including some derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging securities 
to the extent we begin to enter into such transactions in the future  we will adopt the statement s disclosure requirements in the quarterly and annual financial statements for the year ending december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had other financial instruments consisting of fixed rate debt and short term investments 
the substantial majority of our debt obligations have fixed interest rates and are denominated in us dollars  which is our reporting currency 
annual maturities of our debt obligations are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
at december   the carrying value of our debt obligations was  million and the fair value was  million 
the weighted average interest rate of our debt obligations at december  was 
our investments are generally fixed rate short term investment grade and government securities denominated in us dollars 
at december   all of our investments are due to mature within twelve months and the carrying value of such investments approximates fair value 
at december   million of our cash and short term investments were restricted in accordance with the terms of our financing arrangements and certain acquisition hold back agreements 
we actively monitor the capital and investing markets in analyzing our capital raising and investing decisions
