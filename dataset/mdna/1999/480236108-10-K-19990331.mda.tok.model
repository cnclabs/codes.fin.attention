item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results in future periods may differ significantly from the results discussed in or anticipated by such forward looking statements 
certain factors which may impact results for future periods are discussed below under the captions overview and risks and uncertainties 
overview the company manufactures  markets and distributes specialty pharmaceutical products 
the company has achieved significant increases in sales and net income through acquisitions of pharmaceutical products and businesses to complement or expand the company s business and to add selected manufacturing capacity to support certain product lines 
in addition to the significant revenue growth derived from acquisition activity  the company has successfully generated internal growth through targeted promotion of the acquired products 
sales from continuing operations and income from continuing operations have increased from million and million in  respectively  to million and million in  respectively  representing five year compounded annual growth rates of approximately in sales from continuing operations and in income from continuing operations 
excluding nonrecurring charges  the five year compounded annual growth rate of income from continuing operations approximates 
sales from continuing operations are reported net of returns  rebates and discounts during the period in which product is shipped 
product rebates and discounts are incurred due to volume or other contractual allowances on certain sales under contracts with hospitals  buying groups and managed care organizations 
as of december  and  the company maintained reserves of million and million  respectively  for unclaimed but anticipated rebates and discounts 
the increase in the reserve results from increased sales of products subject to contractual discounts and market share rebate adjustments 
product returns  pursuant to operating policies with respect to unused pharmaceuticals  are less than of gross annual sales 
sales from continuing operations are reflected prior to royalties due on sales of certain pharmaceuticals arising from product line acquisitions 
such royalties are recorded as a selling expense 
royalty arrangements typically extend for a fixed period from the date of acquisition and do not require minimum payments to maintain ownership or any rights to products 
during the year ending december   sales from continuing operations were million which were comprised of million of endocrine pharmaceuticals  million of critical care pharmaceuticals  and million of veterinary pharmaceuticals 
the increase in such sales has been influenced by acquisition activity as well as by enhanced marketing activity  customer demand and product availability 
in august the company acquired domestic rights to the brevital pharmaceutical line from lilly for million and a year royalty of on net sales of brevital 
sales from continuing operations of brevital represented approximately of the company s sales from continuing operations in and approximately in in march the company acquired domestic rights to the tapazole pharmaceutical line from lilly for million and a year royalty of on net sales of tapazole 
sales from continuing operations of tapazole represented approximately of the company s sales from continuing operations in and approximately in sales from continuing operations from levoxyl  a key product acquired in connection with the daniels acquisition in  represented approximately of the company s sales from continuing operations in and has increased to approximately in in june  the company acquired domestic  puerto rican and canadian rights to cytomel and triostat from smithkline for million 
the company s strategy for continued growth is dependent upon its ability to increase sales of its existing product portfolio and to acquire  by purchase or exclusive license arrangements  niche market pharmaceuticals which can be promoted through existing marketing and distribution channels 
the company s ability to continue its internal growth within the existing portfolio of products is dependent upon the continued effectiveness of its sales force  the impact of competing products  and the company s reliance upon third party manufacturers to produce certain key products 
the company s operations and growth will also be influenced by regulatory and governmental policies and by competitive forces within the pharmaceutical industry 
in particular  the fda announced in an august   federal register notice that orally administered drug products containing levothyroxine sodium are now classified as new drugs 
manufacturers who wish to continue to market these products must submit nda s 
after august   any levothyroxine sodium product marketed without an approved nda will be subject to regulatory action 
levoxyl  since it was marketed prior to the date of this notice will continue to be eligible for marketing until august  the company plans to dedicate significant resources to this nda process during and and expects to incur costs in excess of million to secure an approved nda for levoxyl 
in pursuing its acquisition strategy  the company relies to a significant degree upon the availability of product lines subject to divestiture or sale by other manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire rights to additional products on acceptable terms  if at all  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s rate of growth and on its business and financial conditions and results of operations 
the company has completed acquisitions since its founding in  however no acquisitions were made during results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the following table sets forth certain data as a percentage of net sales from continuing operations for the periods indicated

in the absence of this charge  operating income from continuing operations would have been of net sales and income from continuing operations before income tax would have increased to 
in  the majority of the income from discontinued operations related to the after tax gain of approximately million on the sale of the company s nutritional supplements product line and contract manufacturing operations

as a result of the company s strategic review process of its product lines and related intangible assets  the company determined that a portion of the goodwill associated with certain lower margin pharmaceutical products had been impaired 
a nonrecurring charge of million was taken in in conjunction with certain costs and expenses associated with the daniels acquisition which was treated as a pooling of interests transaction 
approximately million of such charge related to compensation items directly or indirectly related to the change of control of daniels  including certain costs paid by shareholders  and million to financial advisory services incurred by daniels and its parent  galen 
the remaining portion of such charge related primarily to transaction expenses including the fees and expenses of counsel and accountants for both galen and the company 
operating income from continuing operations operating income from continuing operations during increased or million to million from million in  and decreased as a percentage of sales from continuing operations to in from in  as the result of the million nonrecurring charge in excluding this charge  operation income from continuing operations in was million  representing a increase over the prior year

financial condition balance sheet information the company s current ratio decreased slightly to as of december  from as of december  financing debt as a percentage of equity was zero at both december  and december  working capital increased to million as of december  from million as of december  as a result of the million proceeds net of million in taxes from the sale of the company s nutritional supplements product line and contract manufacturing operations to twinlab  and positive cash flow generated from operating activities 
liquidity and capital resources since inception the company has financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  public and private sales of equity securities and borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
at december  and  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
the net cash generated from operating activities of million in was used for capital improvements of million and payment of dividends to common stockholders of million 
the company believes that available resources and anticipated cash flows from operations are adequate to meet currently anticipated operating needs and to fund future acquisitions 
while the company does not maintain current lines of credit  it believes it has sufficient borrowing capacity in the event that acquisition opportunities cannot be funded from existing resources 
total assets increased million to million at december  from million at december   and total liabilities increased million to million at december  from million at december  net intangible assets decreased million to million at december  from million at december   due to the million non cash accounting charge related to an impairment of certain under performing long lived assets and million of on going amortization expense 
intangible assets as a percent of shareholders equity decreased from at december  to at december  inventories increased 
million to million at december   from million at december  accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the increase in sales for the month of december as compared to december in days outstanding  accounts receivable increased to days at december  from days at december  net property plant and equipment increased by  to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to the continued expansion of the company s pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities during accounts payable and accrued expenses increased from million at december  to million at december  as a result of an increase in trade payables due to the timing of inventory receipts and payments  an increase in accrued sales discounts and rebates  an increase in accrued bonuses and the establishment of reserves to satisfy anticipated future obligations associated with the company s discontinued operations 
the company has experienced only moderate raw material and labor price increases in recent years 
while the company has passed some price increases along to customers  the company has primarily benefited from rapid sales growth  negating most inflationary pressures 
the company s manufacturing operations are not capital intensive and  as such  the impact of inflation on the property  plant and equipment and associated depreciation expense of the company has been minimal 
risks and uncertainties the future results of operations  both annually and from quarter to quarter  are subject to a variety of factors applicable to the company and to the industries and markets in which it operates 
in addition to factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report  the following should be considered 
sales and marketing strategic changes 
the company s marketing and sales staff consists of field sales personnel who call upon office based physicians  out patient surgery centers and critical care hospitals under the direction of one field management team 
in addition  the company has a sales staff of that market and sell veterinary pharmaceuticals 
the company has recently evaluated its overall sales and marketing strategy including an assessment of current competition  product pricing  opportunities for expansion of distribution channels and overall effectiveness of the call plans used by the field sales personnel 
in connection with this evaluation  the company has begun in to evaluate its contract agreements with certain hospital buying groups and to aggressively renegotiate the product pricing under such agreements in those instances where the company believes there is little or no current competition 
in addition  the company has unified its field sales force such that each of the field sales personnel will focus on the company s key products that are currently subject to competition as well as focus on the expansion of distribution channels 
the company believes the renegotiation of contract pricing will result in a reduction in sales discounts  thereby increasing net sales from continuing operations in furthermore  the company believes the unification of the field sales force will result in increased sales and marketing coverage of those products for which the greatest opportunity for growth exists and  in the long term  enhance the productivity and cost effectiveness of its sales and marketing effort 
costs associated with the unification plan  including the company s first annual field management and national sales meetings in the first quarter of  cross training of sales personnel to increase the product knowledge base and the development of additional training materials  product literature and promotional materials are all expected to result in increased selling expenses in there can be no assurance that the renegotiated contract pricing or the unification of the field sales force will not negatively impact sales volume in in addition  there may be quarterly volatility in net sales from continuing operations and selling expenses in as a result of these sales and marketing strategic changes 
dependence upon key products 
the company s continued growth in revenues and earnings is primarily attributable to its acquisitions of a limited number of key products with higher gross margins 
during  sales of tapazole  levoxyl  brevital and thrombin jmi represented  in the aggregate  approximately of total sales from continuing operations 
any factor adversely affecting either the availability of  or the market for  any of such products would have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product pricing constraints and adjustments 
in addition to other competitive factors  the ability of the company to maintain or increase profit margins for products depends in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement to the company s customers and patients from third party health care payors  such as governments  private insurers and managed care organizations 
policies adopted by third party payors influence the pricing of medical services and products 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement will be available for the company s products or that such third party reimbursement will be adequate 
moreover  under contracts with hospitals and buying groups applicable to the sale of many of the company s products  final sales prices to distributors may be subject to retroactive adjustment based upon volume or other contractual discounts provided by the company 
while the company believes that it has adequate reserves to cover such adjustments  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience price adjustments in the future that significantly exceed such reserves 
regulation and product risks 
the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  advertising and sampling of the company s products are subject to extensive regulations by various federal and state agencies  including the fda  the ftc  the dea  the cpsc  the department of agriculture  and the epa 
in addition to other costs of compliance with such regulations  the company is subject to possible risks arising from changes in such regulations or based upon alleged violations of regulations 
such risks could render products unavailable or unmarketable or result in product recalls 
any such development could materially and adversely affect the company s reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  the fda announced in an august   federal register notice that orally administered drug products containing levothyroxine sodium are now classified as new drugs 
manufacturers who wish to continue to market these products must submit nda s 
after august   any levothyroxine sodium product marketed without an approved nda will be subject to regulatory action 
levoxyl  since it was marketed prior to the date of this notice will continue to be eligible for marketing until august  the company plans to dedicate significant resources to this nda process during and and expects to incur costs in excess of million to secure an approved nda for levoxyl 
in addition to government regulation  the company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event use of a product is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects for a patient or consumer 
such risk exists even with respect to those products which are manufactured in regulated facilities or otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale 
while the company has taken  and continues to take  what it believes are appropriate precautions  there can be no assurance that it will avoid significant product liability exposure 
the company currently has product liability insurance in the amount of million per claim and million in the aggregate and excess coverage of million through an umbrella policy  however  there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover potential claims or that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
specifically  in the event that the company s insurance coverage is inadequate to satisfy any resulting liability arising from current fen phen litigation in which the company has been named as a defendant  then the company will have to resume defense of such lawsuits and be responsible for the damages 
information regarding the claims related to fen phen is provided under the caption legal proceedings in item of part i above 
accordingly  product liability claims could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on third party manufacturers 
the company has historically relied on third party manufacturers to produce many of its products and currently relies upon third party manufacturers for production of brevital  tapazole  triostat and cytomel  each of which is a key pharmaceutical 
although such products are subject to manufacturing arrangements with reliable and substantial entities  alternative sources are not readily available and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain adequate supplies of such products in a timely fashion  or at all 
the company s agreement with sb pharmco to manufacture triostat requires the company to use its best efforts to transfer manufacturing of triostat to its own facility or that of a third party prior to june   the end of the year term of the sb pharmco manufacturing agreement 
however  the company can elect at the end of such term to extend the sb pharmco manufacturing agreement for an additional one year term 
the company has identified an alternate third party manufacturer and is currently working with this third party manufacturer to obtain fda approval in in addition  the company received notification from schering in that it would not be renewing the manufacturing agreement for cytomel following the end of its term in march as a result  the company is currently qualifying several alternative third party manufacturers in order to replace the schering manufacturing agreement prior to its termination 
disruption in the available supply of brevital  tapazole  triostat or cytomel or the inability of the company to obtain sources of supply upon the expiration of current manufacturing arrangements would be materially adverse to the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
with respect to the supply of finished goods from third party manufacturers  the company has experienced temporary product shortages 
the most recent occurrence was in the second quarter of related to an approximate  backorder of brevital 
this product shortage resulted from increased demand for brevital that lilly was unable to supply due to production and delivery delays 
the brevital backorders at june  were fulfilled during the third quarter of competition 
many of the company s competitors have considerably greater financial  sales  marketing and technical resources than those of the company 
in addition  many of the company s present competitors have extensive research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with the company s products 
technological advances affecting the cost of production as well as marketing or pricing action by one or more of the competitors could also materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications  including those embedded in equipment and facilities  use two digit rather than four digit date fields to designate an applicable year 
as a result  the systems and applications may not properly recognize the year or process data that includes it  potentially causing data miscalculations or inaccuracies or operational malfunctions or failures 
the inability to accurately process date related information would have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to mitigate the risks of a year failure  a year action plan the plan has been developed and is currently being executed by the company 
the plan is directed and monitored by the company s is information systems steering committee and is proceeding within the planned timetable 
the plan addresses the year risk presented by the following is and non is elements of the company s operations financial systems 
in  the company completed the replacement of its software and systems in the normal course of business 
the financial system has been replaced with an enterprise reporting system that the developer states is year compliant 
other date sensitive systems and equipment 
non financial systems used in the company s manufacturing facilities are currently being upgraded or replaced in connection with plant expansions and or on going equipment validation procedures in the ordinary course of business 
the upgrade or replacement of other non financial systems and equipment relating to distribution  voice and data telecommunication  laboratory testing  and security and environmental control is substantially complete 
for the remaining elements  assessment and remediation measures  if necessary  will be initiated during the second quarter of other date sensitive equipment is scheduled to be assessed and remediation measures  if necessary  will be initiated during the second quarter of third party relationships 
the company is highly dependent on internal and third party computer systems to process its daily transactions 
the company has commenced efforts to determine the extent to which it may be impacted by year issues of third parties  including suppliers  customers  and service providers 
contact with major customers and suppliers has been initiated 
to date  the company is not aware of any non year compliant third party customers  suppliers  or service providers that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring these entities will be year ready 
furthermore  the company has no means of ensuring that the customers eg  hospital buying groups  hospitals  and pharmacies of its wholesale distributors will be year ready 
the inability of third parties to complete their year programs in a timely manner could materially and adversely impact the company 
the assessment of risk related to third party relationships is expected to be completed during the second quarter of given the company s reliance upon third party manufacturers for the supply of certain key products  the company has made arrangements to purchase to months supply of brevital  tapazole and cytomel in the fourth quarter of the company plans to test and validate identified financial systems  other date sensitive systems and equipment  and third party communications for year compliance 
this testing will be initiated in the second quarter of  and will be completed by december  validation procedures will be performed and managed by internal company staff 
the costs associated with the plan have  for the most part  been planned capital expenditures and budgeted internal staffing expenses 
the total capital expenditures related to these system upgrades and or replacements approximate million and have been capitalized as incurred in additional costs to be incurred to complete the plan are not expected to be significant and will relate to the ongoing capital expenditures and internal staffing described above 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failure could materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
although the company has not yet developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if the company or any of the third parties upon which the company is dependent is unable to achieve year readiness  a plan will be completed by the fourth quarter of to address the most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to potential year compliance failures 
based on the company s progress to date and timeline to complete the year plan  the company does not foresee significant financial or operational risks associated with its compliance at this time 
however  these expectations are subject to uncertainties including  but not limited to  the readiness of third party customers  suppliers and service providers  failure to identify all susceptible systems  and the availability and cost of personnel necessary to address any unforeseen problems
