the company and omnioffices initiated this litigation by filing a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the terms of the debt conversion were fair  after these two stockholders threatened to challenge the terms of the conversion  claiming that the conversion price utilized  and the methods by which the conversion price was agreed upon between the company and omnioffices  were not fair to omnioffices or these stockholders 
the two stockholders filed counterclaims against the company  omnioffices and the board of directors of omnioffices seeking a judgment declaring the conversion void or voidable  or in the alternative compensatory and punitive damages 
although the company believes that the two stockholders claims are without merit and that it and omnioffices will ultimately prevail in their actions against the two stockholders  there can be no assurance that the court will not find the conversion price to have been unfair and declare the conversion void  which would have the effect of diluting the company s equity interest in omnioffices  or award the two stockholders compensatory and punitive damages 
however  even if the two stockholders were successful in their claims  the company does not believe that such a result would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company or omnioffices 
the company is a party to a variety of other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business 
all of these other matters  taken together  are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company

the company  in order to qualify as a reit  is required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to its stockholders in amounts at least equal to i the sum of a of its reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gain and b of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus ii the sum of certain items of non cash income 
the company s distribution strategy is to distribute what it believes is a conservative percentage of its cash flow permitting the company to retain funds for capital improvements and other investments while funding its distributions 
for federal income tax purposes  distributions may consist of ordinary income  capital gains  nontaxable return of capital or a combination thereof 
distributions that exceed the company s current and accumulated earnings and profits calculated for tax purposes constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend and reduce the stockholder s basis in his or her shares of common stock 
to the extent that a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder s basis in his or her shares  it will generally be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder s shares

rental revenue  executive office suites revenue and real estate service revenue have been the principal sources of capital to fund the operating expenses  debt service and capital expenditures of the company and its affiliates  excluding non recurring capital expenditures 
the company believes that these sources of revenue will continue to provide the necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service 
the company and its affiliates also require capital to invest in their existing portfolio of operating assets for major capital projects such as large scale renovations  routine capital expenditures and deferred maintenance on certain properties recently acquired and tenant related capital expenditures  such as tenant improvements and allowances and leasing commissions 
additionally  the company and its affiliates including carramerica development will require a substantial amount of capital for development projects currently underway and planned for the future 
as of december   the company including carramerica development had approximately million square feet of office space in development projects underway which are expected to require a total investment of approximately million 
as of december   million  or of the total expected investment  had been expended 
the company s other affiliates also have various capital needs 
specifically  omnioffices is currently developing executive office suite centers 
the total cost to complete these projects is expected to be approximately million  of which approximately million had been expended as of december  omni uk is currently developing six executive office suite centers with an expected total cost to complete of million  of which million had been expended as of december  in addition  omnioffices and omni uk will periodically consider several acquisitions of existing executive office suite centers

historically  management has primarily met the company s capital requirements by accessing the public equity and debt markets 
however  because of certain unfavorable conditions currently existing in the public equity and debt markets  the company does not believe that these markets are currently providing the company with the most attractive sources of capital 
if conditions in the public equity or debt markets improve  the company will evaluate the cost of capital raised in such markets to determine if it is the most attractive capital available to the company at the time 
however  there can be no assurance that conditions will improve in the near term 
in response to the current conditions in the equity and debt markets  the company plans to address its cash needs through utilization of the company s line of credit  refinancing select assets  prudent use of joint ventures and the disposition of certain assets 
as of march   the company had four projects under contract for sale in the northern california and suburban washington  dc markets 
these projects are expected to produce net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  the company and its affiliates had nine projects under letter of intent for sale as of march  these projects are expected to produce net proceeds of approximately million 
due to the uncertainties in the disposition process  there can be no assurances that these sales will close or that they will achieve the expected net proceeds 
if i the debt and equity capital markets do not improve  ii the company is unable to raise the expected net proceeds from dispositions of properties  and iii the company is unable to obtain capital from other sources  the company believes that it would continue to have sufficient funds to continue to pay its operating and debt service expenses  its regular quarterly dividends and to meet the necessary capital requirements with respect to its existing portfolio of operating assets 
however  the company s ability to continue to fund all of its current development projects could be adversely affected 
if the company determined that it was in the best interests of the company to continue to fund all of its current development projects  the company may have to access either the public equity or debt markets  which  at that time  may not be the most attractive source of capital

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk increases in interest rates  or the loss of the benefits from any hedging agreements of the company  would increase our interest expense  which would adversely affect cash flow 
as of december   the company has million outstanding under its line of credit that bears interest at a floating rate and of additional fixed rate mortgage debt 
these mortgage loans mature at various times through the company also has issued million unsecured notes  matures between and the company is currently a party to an interest rate hedge agreement in order to hedge against the impact that interest rate fluctuations would have on the floating rate debt under its line of credit 
although the hedging agreements enable us to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate liabilities  they expose us to the risk that the counterparties to such hedge agreements may not perform  negating the benefit of the hedging arrangements 
in addition  if interest rates decline after we enter into a hedging agreement  our interest expense would increase as compared to the underlying floating rate and could result in us making payments to unwind such agreements 
as a result of declining interest rate environment in  we made payments of approximately million in cash in february to unwind treasure lock arrangements 
the fair market value of these treasury lock agreements at december  was negative million 
the company s future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company manages its risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities with projected cash outflows to fund debt payments  acquisitions  capital expenditures  distributions  and other cash requirements 
the company also uses certain derivative financial instruments at times to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments or for trading purposes 
if the market rates of interest on the company s variable rate debt change by or approximately basis points the company s interest expense would change by approximately million  assuming the amount outstanding under the variable rate facility remains at million  the balance at december  furthermore book value of this variable interest credit facility approximates market value at december  a change in interest rates generally does not impact future earnings and cash flows for fixed rate debt instruments  but as fixed rate debt matures and if additional debt is acquired to fund the repayments under maturing facilities  future earnings and cash flows may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
this impact would be realized in the periods subsequent to debt maturities 
the following is a summary of the fixed rate to debt maturities in thousands thereafter  assuming the repayments of fixed rate borrowings are made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective credit arrangements  a percent change in the market interest rate for the respective fixed rate debt instruments would change the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt be approximately million 
the estimated fair market value of the fixed rate debt instruments and the unsecured notes at december  was million and million  respectively 
because we have made loans to a foreign affiliate  omni uk  we are exposed to risks that there will be a significant change in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the british pound  as well as the possibility of the imposition or modification of exchange controls by governments or monetary authorities 
these risks generally depend on factors beyond our control  such as economic  financial and political events and the supply and demand for various currencies 
we may invest in other entities with operations in foreign countries  and if we do  the same risks will apply to the currencies utilized in those countries 
the company s current exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is not significant

the company calculates its funds from operations by combining the funds from operations from its real estate operations  calculated in accordance with nareit s definition of funds from operations  and the earnings before depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes ebdadt of the company s executive suites business  excluding operating losses from centers under development 
the company s funds from operations may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flow generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and  as such  should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or the company s ability to make distributions
