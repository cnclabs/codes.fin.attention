item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the december  audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k 
statements concerning future performance  development or events  concerning expectations for growth and market forecasts  and any other guidance on future periods  constitute forward looking statements and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which might cause actual results to differ materially from stated expectations 
specific factors include  but are not limited to the effect of interest rate changes  risks associated with acquisition of other banks and opening new branches  the ability to control costs and expenses  and general economic condition 
additional information on these and other factors which could affect the company s financial results are included in filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
general in fiscal  the company began to implement a growth strategy intended to broaden its products and services from traditional thrift offerings to those more closely related to commercial banking 
that strategy entails geographic and product expansion  loan portfolio diversification  development of relationship banking  and maintenance of asset quality 
the company has incurred substantial expenses as it carried out its growth strategy 
those expenses have been concentrated in i personnel hired in anticipation of growth and expanded market share  ii maintaining the mortgage origination capacity during times of fluctuating mortgage origination volumes  iii facilities expansion and iv upgrading data processing capabilities 
these expenditures had a negative impact on the company s earnings in fiscal  fiscal and for the six months ended december  management believes these investments will have a positive impact on earnings into in fiscal  the company s growth strategy was further bolstered by two significant events the january stock offering and conversion and its acquisition of north pacific bancorporation 
through the january stock offering  the company raised million in net new capital which has  and will continue to  enhance its ability to implement its growth strategy 
using million of the net proceeds of the stock offering  the company completed its first bank acquisition in june by purchasing all of the outstanding stock of north pacific bancorporation whose wholly owned subsidiary was north pacific bank 
this acquisition of north pacific bank provided further geographical expansion into the pierce county market area and enhanced expertise in commercial banking 
this is demonstrated by the substantial shift in loan portfolio composition as commercial loans increased to million  or of total loans  as of december  from million  or of total loans  as of june  while this acquisition had a significant impact on the company s growth and financial condition at june   north pacific bank s operations had a minimal impact on the company s earnings for the year ended june  due to the timing of the closing of the transaction on june  during the six months ended december   management integrated the operations of north pacific bank into heritage bank culminating in the merging of data processing systems effective november  and substantially upgrading north pacific bank s item processing capability to handle existing and projected future volumes 
management invested million in item processing hardware and software and facilities which became operational in december net interest income the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income it receives on its loan and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
like most financial institutions  the company s interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates and by government policies 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following tables set forth for the periods indicated information for the company with respect to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  resultant yields or costs  net interest income  net interest spread  net interest margin and the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities 
the average loan balances presented in the table are net of allowances for loan losses

results of operations for the six month periods ended december  and net income 
the company s net income before merger related charges was million or per diluted share for the six months ended december  as compared to million or per diluted share for the same period last year 
including merger related charges of  on a pre tax basis  net income for the six months ended december  was million or per diluted share 
these nonrecurring charges were related to severance and other costs associated with the merger and integration of north pacific bank into heritage bank in november  costs associated with the formerly proposed acquisition of harbor bancorp which was terminated by mutual agreement in december  and costs associated with the pending acquisition of washington independent bancshares  inc wib 
the wib transaction was consummated effective march  and will be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  for the six months ended december  compared with the same period last year  primarily as a result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
this growth in interest earning assets was attributable to million in interest earning assets acquired through north pacific bank in june and the interest earning assets funded by the million in net proceeds raised in the company s january stock offering 
average loan balances increased million  or  which was concentrated in commercial loans 
net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets net interest margin annualized for the six months ended december  increased to from for the same period last year 
the increase was the result of strong growth in commercial loans which have higher yields and a lower cost funding mix attributable to the million in net proceeds from the company s january stock offering and the addition of lower cost deposits acquired with north pacific bank 
the significant shift in the company s funding mix is demonstrated in the company s ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities which increased to for the six months ended december  from for the same period prior year 
this ratio indicates that the company is funding more of its earning asset growth with noninterest bearing funds capital and noninterest bearing deposits 
the company s net interest spread annualized for the six months ended december  has declined to from for the same period last year as a result of the decrease in the average yield on earning assets to for the six months ended december  from for the same period last year 
although the average yield on loans increased to for the six months ended december  from for the same period last year due primarily to the growth in commercial loans with higher yields  the increase in the average balances of investment securities and interest earning deposits at yields significantly below the average earning asset yield  as well as the decline in market interest rates  had the effect of decreasing the overall earning asset yield for the six months ended december  provision for loan losses 
during the six months ended december   the company provided  through operations to maintain its allowance for loan losses at an adequate level during a time of change in loan portfolio composition and loan growth 
in the six months ended december   the company experienced net charge offs of  most of which were related to loans originated and classified by north pacific bank prior to the company s acquisition of north pacific bank in june while the company s loan portfolio  and in particular commercial loans  have grown substantially over the past three years  the company s asset quality has remained very solid as demonstrated by the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of at december  because commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending  the company has increased the portion of its general allowance for loan losses allocated to its commercial loans over the past three years 
management considers the allowance for loan losses at december  to be adequate to cover reasonably foreseeable loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including the level of problem loans  business conditions  estimated collateral values  loss experience and credit concentrations 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased  or  for the six months ended december  compared with the same period last year 
this increase was primarily due to increases in gains on sales of loans  service charges on deposits and other income 
gains on sales of loans increased  or for the period compared to the same period in due to the increase in the volume of mortgage loans sold in the period 
service charges on deposits increased  or  as a result of growth in business and personal checking accounts 
other income increased  or  for the period due to  in fees from vehicle licensing activities performed by a former subsidiary of north pacific bank as well as increases in the volume of loan servicing fees and merchant card processing fees 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million  or  for the period compared to the period 
this million increase included  in merger related charges related to severance and other costs associated with the merger and integration of north pacific bank into heritage bank in november  costs associated with the formerly proposed acquisition of harbor bancorp which was terminated by mutual agreement in december and costs associated with the then pending acquisition of washington independent bancshares  inc excluding merger related charges  noninterest expense increased million  or  primarily in the areas of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  amortization of goodwill and other noninterest expenses due to the impact of the acquisition and integration of the operations of north pacific bank 
total noninterest expense adjusted for the nonrecurring merger related charges was of total revenue the sum of net interest income and noninterest income for the six months ended december  as compared to for the six months ended december  results of operations for the years ended june  and net income 
the company s earnings increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june   compared with million  or per diluted share  for the same period in  an increase of 
the increase in net income was primarily attributable to a million increase in the average balance of earning assets and a widening of the net interest margin 
the majority of the increase in earning assets and the widening of the net interest margin was the result of the large influx of equity capital million from the company s january stock offering 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or in compared to  primarily as a result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
this growth in interest earning assets was funded by the million in net proceeds raised in the company s january stock offering 
average loan balances increased million  or  which was concentrated in commercial loans with higher yields 
net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets net interest margin for increased to from in the increase was primarily attributable to growth in earning assets combined with a significant shift in the company s funding mix due to the funds raised in the company s recent stock offering 
this is demonstrated by the increase in the company s ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities to for from for which indicates that the company is funding more of its earning asset growth with non interest bearing funds capital and noninterest bearing deposits 
the company s net interest spread for has declined to from for as a result of the decrease in the average yield on earning assets to for from for although the average yield on loans increased to for from for due primarily to the growth in commercial loans with higher yields  the increase in the average balances of investment securities and interest earning deposits at yields significantly below the average earning asset yield had the effect of decreasing the overall earning asset yield for provision for loan losses 
during  the company provided  through operations to maintain its allowance for loan losses at an adequate level during a time of change in loan portfolio composition and loan growth 
in  the company recorded a million recovery on a multifamily mortgage loan which had been partially charged off in a prior year 
in reviewing the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses as of june   management determined that the allowance balance was more than adequate to cover any potential losses in the company s loan portfolio and therefore reduced the allowance balance through a  negative provision for loan losses 
management considers the allowance for loan losses at june  to be adequate to cover reasonably foreseeable loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including the level of problem loans  business conditions  estimated collateral values  loss experience and credit concentrations 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased  or  for compared with primarily due to the  or  increase in gains on sales of loans for the increase in gains on sales of loans was attributable to the increase in the volume of mortgages sold million for compared to million for and the increase in residential mortgage loan originations for compared to commissions on sales of annuities and securities decreased  or  as a result of lower sales volume due to staff turnover 
service charges on deposits increased  or  due to growth in personal and business checking accounts 
other income increased  or  for due to increases in the volume of fees related to merchant credit card processing and customer check ordering activity 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense decreased  or  in compared with excluding the million special saif assessment in  noninterest expense in increased million  or  compared with adjusted expense levels 
the increase in noninterest expenses during were concentrated in data processing and marketing expenses and represent a continuation of the company s implementation of its growth strategy  specifically  geographical and product expansion  development of relationship banking and loan portfolio diversification 
the company has i developed business checking accounts and commercial lending products and services for businesses and their owners  ii introduced credit and debit cards  iii installed an automated response system for customer account inquiries and iv developed products to assist realtors and potential borrowers to obtain information about loan programs 
total noninterest expense was of total revenue the sum of net interest income and noninterest income for the year ended june  as compared to adjusted for the nonrecurring saif assessment for salaries and employee benefits increased  or  for as a result of increases in mortgage commissions  salaries and benefits related to north pacific bank employees for june and increases in payroll taxes  health insurance and other employee benefits 
mortgage commissions increased  or  due to the increased volume of residential mortgage loans originated and the increased proportion of that volume produced by commissioned loan officers 
the increases in data processing  marketing and other expenses were due to the company s implementation of its growth strategy as described in the paragraph above 
results of operations for the years ended june  and net income 
net income was million  or per share  for the year ended june  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended june   an decline  primarily as a result of noninterest expense increasing more rapidly than net interest income  coupled with a decrease in noninterest income 
the increase in noninterest expenses was attributable to two factors the expansion in pierce county of the company s branch office network and development of the company s relationship banking capacity  and the legislatively mandated  one time assessment levied by the fdic on all saif insured institutions to recapitalize the saif deposit insurance fund 
the decrease in noninterest income was principally the result of lower gains on sales of loans due to a decline in the volume of originations of residential mortgage loans 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to a million increase in the average balance of loans 
the growth in average loan balances was most pronounced in commercial loans million of the total million increase 
net interest income increased as a result of an improved net interest spread coupled with average interest earning assets increasing more rapidly than average interest bearing liabilities  with the difference funded by noninterest bearing deposits 
net interest margin  which is net income divided by average interest earning assets  for increased to from in the increase was primarily the result of a growth in earning assets at increased rates coupled with a decline in the average cost of interest bearing deposits particularly for certificates of deposit 
certificates of deposit with scheduled maturities of one year or less increased to of certificate accounts as of june  compared to as of june   while average rates on certificates decreased to from 
the increase in the average yield on interest earning assets was the result of shifting funds from lower yielding investments and mortgage backed securities into higher yielding loans and the overall growth in loans  particularly commercial loans 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income decreased  or  in compared with the major component of this category  gains on sales of loans  decreased million  or from to due to a lower volume of mortgage loans sold million in compared to million in 
the decrease in volume of originations of one to four family residential mortgage loans in compared with was due to weakness in the residential mortgage market and the loss of two key producers by the end of fiscal commissions on sales of annuities and securities declined  or  as a result of lower sales volume due to staff turnover 
service charges on deposits increased  or  due to growth in personal and business checking accounts 
in june  the bank sold its former branch premises in shelton  recognizing an  gain on the sale 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million  or  in compared with the increase was attributable to i the company s expansion of its branch network in pierce county and development of the company s relationship banking capacity  and ii a one time special assessment of million required by legislation enacted in august  to recapitalize the saif fund of the fdic 
total noninterest expense less the nonrecurring saif assessment of million was of adjusted revenue the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income  for the year ended june  as compared to for the same period in salaries and employee benefits increased  or 
the increase reflects the hiring of a senior loan administrator in june and six commercial lending officers for the pierce county market four of which were hired in june  the staffing additions for the th and pacific branch which opened in october and the full year effect of staffing additions for the lakewood branch which opened in february 
occupancy expense increased  or  as a result of the operating costs of the new branch facilities opened during and and the full year depreciation impact of the installation of a bank wide personal computer network in march fdic premiums and special assessment increased  or  due to the million special assessment mentioned above 
the bank s federal deposit insurance premiums were reduced by the fdic from on an annualized basis of insured deposits for the quarter ended september  to of insured deposits for the semi annual period ended june  income taxes 
the company recorded a federal income tax benefit of  for the year ended june  as a result of the reversal of  deferred tax liability related to the potential recapture of the pre additions to the tax bad debt reserve which could have been triggered by the mhc reorganization in january based on subsequent legislation  the company reversed the  deferred tax liability as a reduction of federal income tax expense during the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are customer deposits  loan repayments  loan sales  maturing investment securities and advances from the fhlb of seattle 
these funds  together with retained earnings  equity and other borrowed funds  are used to make loans  acquire investment securities and other assets and to fund continuing operations 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy other financial commitments and to fund operations 
the company generally maintains sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at december  cash and cash equivalents totaled million  or of total assets  and investment securities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity with maturities of one year or less amounted to million  or of total assets 
at december   the bank maintained a credit facility with the fhlb of seattle for up to of assets or million of which only  was outstanding at that date 
to fund the growth of the company  management s strategy has been to build core deposits which the company defines to include all deposits except public funds through the development of its branch office network and commercial banking relationships 
total deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at june  due to the one time withdrawal of approximately million in temporary funds deposited in june  excluding the impact of this million withdrawal  total deposits increased during the six months ended december  this net deposit outflow was concentrated in certificates of deposit which was somewhat attributable to management lowering offering rates on certificates to control its overall cost of funds 
historically  the company has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature 
management anticipates that the company will continue to rely on the same sources of funds in the future and will use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase investment securities 
the company and its subsidiary bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   the company and its subsidiary bank were classified as a well capitalized institution under the criteria established by the fdic act 
as of june  and  heritage bank was also classified as a well capitalized institution 
asset liability management the company s primary financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while controlling its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
to accomplish this objective  management has formulated an interest rate risk management policy that attempts to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities while maintaining an acceptable interest rate sensitivity position 
the principal strategies which the company employs to control its interest rate sensitivity are i sale of most long term  fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loan originations in the secondary mortgage market  ii the origination of commercial loans and residential construction loans at variable interest rates for terms generally one year or less  and iii offers noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts to businesses and individuals 
the longer term objective is to reduce its dependency on certificates of deposit  which tend to be a higher cost source of funds and most susceptible to movement from the company if market interest rates increase  by increasing its proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and money market accounts and savings deposits 
the company s asset and liability management strategies have resulted in a positive gap of for the month period and a relatively neutral one year gap of as of december  these gaps measure the difference between the dollar amount of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within the designated period months and one year as a percentage of total interest earning amounts  based on certain estimates and assumptions as discussed below 
the acquisition of north pacific bank has accelerated the company s progress toward its objective by adding more variable rate commercial loans to the company s loan portfolio and reducing the percentage of certificates of deposit to total deposits from as of june  to as of december  although management believes that the implementation of its operating strategies has reduced the potential effects of changes in market interest rates on the company s results of operations  the positive gap for the month period indicates that decreases in market interest rates may adversely affect the company s results in the near term 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing and the resulting interest rate sensitivity gap of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  based upon estimates of expected mortgage prepayment rates and deposit decay rates consistent with national trends 
the company has adjusted mortgage loan maturities for loans held for sale by reflecting these loans in the zero to three month category which is consistent with their sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the amounts in the table are derived from the company s internal data  and because certain assumptions have been utilized in presenting this data  the amounts may not be consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere in this document that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the amounts in the tables also could be significantly affected by external factors  such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawal of deposits and competition 
estimated maturity or repricing within more than months months years years years total dollars in thousands interest earnings assets loans       investment securities      fhlb stock   fed funds sold   interest earning deposits   total interest earning assets       noninterest earning assets  total assets  interest bearing liabilities deposits certificates of deposit     savings accounts       interest bearing demand and money market deposits      total interest bearing deposits       fhlb advances and other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities       noninterest bearing liabilities and equity  total liabilities and equity  rate sensitivity gap      cumulative rate sensitivity gap amount      as a percentage of interest earning assets certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of a substantial increase in market interest rates 
year issues the company utilizes various computer software programs to provide banking products and services to its customers 
many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field and were not designed to consider the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
the company has completed the identification phase in which management has determined the extent to which all programs used in its business are year compliant 
heritage bank utilizes a service bureau to perform its most mission critical data processing services related to its loans  deposits  general ledger and other financial applications 
the service bureau has completed the software programming for all of its applications used by the bank 
testing of these service bureau programs commenced in november and are expected to be completed by mid the company has evaluated its major third party business relationships  including vendors and its borrowers 
the significant dependence on the service bureau creates potential exposure for the company  however  management fully expects the service bureau to meet the scheduled timetable for testing which would ensure that the company s mission critical applications would be year compliant by july the company has analyzed the extent that year issues could adversely impact their borrowers business operations  particularly its commercial borrowers 
the company has performed an initial assessment of each major borrower and has established an ongoing assessment as part of the company s credit granting and loan review process 
management expects the company s costs related to year issues for to amount to approximately  primarily for the testing of service bureau applications 
of the past expenditures  approximately  was incurred in the year ended june  and approximately  was incurred to replace the existing north pacific bank telephone and voice mail system and modify the existing heritage bank telecommunications systems as part of the merger of operations which was completed in october the company has prepared a contingency plan with timetables to pursue various alternatives based on failure of the service bureau to adequately modify and or provide sufficient testing and validation resources for the company and the service bureau to ensure the mission critical applications are year compliant 
the most likely worst case scenario would be that the testing and validation of the software modifications were not completed by the scheduled deadline of july this worst case scenario could increase the company s overall expected year costs  however  management believes that this scenario is not probable to occur and if the scenario should occur  that the impact of these additional costs would not be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on the company s operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates
