year compliance the company has analyzed substantially all of its operations to determine year status and is currently implementing the procedures necessary to ensure timely year compliance 
the company has also identified and contacted its key customers  vendors and suppliers to request confirmation of timely external year compliance 
although such survey is not yet complete  to date there are no indications that key customers  vendors or suppliers will be materially affected by year related problems 
each of the company s facilities utilizes and is dependent upon data processing systems and software to conduct business 
the company has received confirmation from vendors of most of the business software used by the company that such software is designed to be year compliant 
further  for reasons generally unrelated to the year issue  the company has purchased and installed new systems for certain operations at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars 
the company currently anticipates that all internally used software will be year compliant in a timely manner 
additionally  various machines and other types of personal property at each facility have computer controls and or contain integrated circuits that may be affected  and the company has identified such property to determine year compliance 
where necessary  such items are either being repaired or replaced 
to date  costs of such repairs and replacements have not been material 
although  the company currently believes that it will be internally year compliant in all material respects prior to january  and that the effort to achieve year compliance has not and will not have a significant impact on the financial condition or results of future operations of the company  the company remains concerned that the failure to comply by a relatively small number of large customers and or vendors  including banking institutions  utilities  telecommunications and transportation companies  could significantly disrupt operations at one or more of the company s facilities 
summa does not have a formalized company wide contingency plan covering worst case scenarios in the event of year non compliance 
any such plan  if and when formalized  would likely include technical contacts  access to backup systems and alternative vendor sources  among other things
