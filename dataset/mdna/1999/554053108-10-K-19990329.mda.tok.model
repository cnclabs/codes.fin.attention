construction services the company conducts its business through its direct and indirect operating subsidiaries 
the construction services performed by the company are principally involved in two areas  infrastructure services and commercial industrial services 
the commercial industrial services include electrical construction and mechanical construction 
infrastructure services the infrastructure construction and maintenance services involve primarily electric utility line construction and maintenance services to electric utilities  other similar entities and other users of these higher voltage electrical construction services  gas utility construction services to utilities  telecommunication construction services to a broad spectrum of clients and traffic signal and street lighting construction services predominantly to various departments of transportation and municipalities 
myers  hawkeye  harlan  sturgeon and dw close each provide some or all of these services to their respective markets 
the company generally serves the electric utility and gas utility industries as a prime construction contractor while its telecommunications services and its traffic and street lighting services are provided both as a prime contractor and as a subcontractor 
designs and specifications for a project are usually prepared by the clients or their agents 
the services provided to electric utilities and other similar entities include the construction and maintenance of high voltage transmission lines  substations and distribution systems 
the gas construction services involves the underground installation and repair of gas mains and lines 
the telecommunications services include the installation of foundations and towers for pcs and cellular wireless communication installations  fiber optic and copper communication installation for the transmission of voice  data and video

construction materials are generally supplied by the clients although the company occasionally may be required to procure and supply the construction materials 
most contracts undertaken by the company are completed within twelve months  although certain contracts may extend for longer periods 
commercial industrial construction services the company  through sturgeon and dw close  provides electric construction and maintenance services to the commercial and industrial marketplace 
these services are typically referred to as inside electrical construction 
the company s work in the commercial and industrial electric construction market place is most often performed as a subcontractor to a general contractor  however  the company does perform certain commercial and industrial construction services as a prime contractor 
commercial and industrial electrical maintenance services are frequently performed by the company as a prime contractor 
the company generally provides the materials to be installed as a part of the scope of these contracts which vary greatly in size and duration 
the company provides such construction services on many varied types of projects including airports  hospitals  hotels and casinos  arenas and convention centers  and manufacturing and process facilities 
on occasion  a subsidiary of the company will enter into a joint venture with another contractor to perform a specific project 
in these cases the subsidiary and the other contractor will typically share in the profits or losses on the project in the percentage determined by the joint venture agreement 
the joint venture agreement will define the obligations of the subsidiary and the other contractor with respect to the project and the management of the venture 
the company  through power piping  provides mechanical construction and maintenance services for the steel industry  electric utility industry  chemical industry  food processors and other industrial customers located in the eastern half of the united states 
these services are provided by the company both as a prime contractor and as a subcontractor 
general the company s construction and maintenance crews are active year round in all geographic areas in which the company operates 
winter weather in some northern areas and summer weather in some southern areas can adversely impact work schedules 
the company is subject to the authority of state and municipal regulatory bodies concerned with the licensing of contractors 
the company has experienced no material difficulty in complying with the requirements imposed on it by such regulatory bodies 
the company s operations are currently conducted primarily in the united states 
customers electric utilities  in the aggregate  represent the largest customer base of the company 
during the last five years  the company s ten largest customers accounted for of its consolidated contract revenues and its single largest customer accounted for of such revenue 
general contractors  as a group  constitute a significant group of customers for the company s commercial and industrial work 
municipal or other government funded large projects provide the company with significant revenues when it is awarded all or a substantial part of the electrical construction work on such projects 
in the company s ten largest customers accounted for of annual revenues 
the company s single largest customer during accounting for of such revenue 
contracts the company enters into contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts undertaken by the company  contracts will usually be either lump sum or unit price contracts pursuant to which the company agrees to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project or for the particular units of work performed 
on occasion  the company does obtain cost plus contracts which provide for reimbursement of costs incurred by the company  often within stated limits  plus the payment of a fee in a fixed amount or equal to a percentage of reimbursable cost 
on occasion these cost plus contracts require the company to include a guaranteed not to exceed maximum price 
lump sum or unit price contracts have accounted for the larger portion of the company s contract revenues in recent years 
such contracts typically place greater risks on the company than do cost plus contracts 
a portion of the work performed by the company requires performance and payment bonds at the time of execution of the contract 
contracts generally include payment provisions pursuant to which a to retainage is withheld from each progress payment until the contract work has been completed and approved 
the company s backlog was million at december   compared to million at december  the varying magnitude and duration of projects undertaken by the company may result in substantial fluctuations in its backlog from time to time 
substantially all of the december  backlog will be completed in certain of the projects which the company undertakes are not completed in one accounting period 
revenue on construction contracts is recorded on the percentage of completion accounting method determined by the ratio of cost incurred to date on the contracts excluding uninstalled direct materials to management s estimates of total contract costs 
projected losses are provided for in their entirety when identified 
some projects give rise to claims by the company against its customers for additional compensation based upon such matters as scheduling changes  delays and interruptions or improper or revised specifications 
the resolution of such claims often extends over several years 
management s judgment as to the possible outcome of such claims pending at the end of a financial reporting period is reflected in the company s results of operations for such period and is revised in subsequent periods  if and as  required by developments with respect to such claims see note to the financial statements 
competition the company s business is highly competitive in both its infrastructure construction services and commercial industrial construction services 
competition in both areas is primarily based on the price of the construction services rendered and upon the reputation for quality  safety and reliability of the contractor rendering them 
the competition encountered by the company can vary depending upon the type of construction services which it renders 
infrastructure construction competition the infrastructure construction and maintenance service provided by the company often requires larger amounts of capital and more specialized equipment than the requirements for commercial industrial construction 
larger infrastructure projects require more heavy duty equipment as well as stronger financial resources to meet the cash flow requirements of these projects 
these factors sometimes reduce the number of potential competitors on these projects to the larger competitors 
the number of firms which generally compete for any significant infrastructure project varies greatly depending on a number of factors  including the size of the project  its location and the bidder qualification requirements imposed upon contractors by the customer 
many of the competitors the company encounters restrict their operations to one geographic area while others operate nationally  as does the company 
commercial industrial construction competition competition for the commercial industrial construction services provided by the company varies greatly 
size and location of the project will impact which competitors and the number of competitors that the company will encounter on any particular project 
the individual relationships with general contractors developed over several years by particular contractors based upon prior projects worked together will impact the company s and its competitors opportunities to bid on certain projects 
the equipment requirements for this type of work are generally not as significant as for the infrastructure construction 
since commercial and industrial construction typically involves the purchase of materials by the contractor the financial resources to meet these requirements on particular projects may impact the competition the company encounters 
the company has performed such construction services principally in the western half of the united states with the exception of the mechanical portion of the company s commercial and industrial construction services  provided through power piping which have been performed principally in the eastern half of the united states 
certain of the company s competitors for this type of work operate nationally  however  the preponderance of the company s competition operates regionally 
the company s competition includes entities which operate solely as union contractors  solely as non union contractors  or in certain cases  through related companies having both union and non union contractors 
in essentially all cases involving maintenance services provided by the company  the company s customers will also perform some or all of these types of services as well 
employees at december   the company had approximately salaried employees including executive officers  district managers  project managers  superintendents  estimators  office managers  and staff and clerical personnel 
the company also employed approximately  hourly rated employees 
this number fluctuates depending upon the number and size of the projects under construction by the company at any particular time 
during peak construction periods  the company had about  hourly rated employees working on various construction projects in approximately of the company s hourly rated employees were members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew  afl cio 
such ibew employees are represented by numerous local unions under various agreements with varying terms and expiration dates 
such local agreements are entered into by and between the ibew local and the national electrical contractors association  of which the company is a member 
on occasion the company will employ employees who are members of other trade unions pursuant to multi employer  multi union project agreements 
item properties construction equipment the company owns a substantial amount of construction equipment 
this equipment  which at december  had an aggregate cost of million and a book value of million includes  among other items  trucks  trailers  tractors  tension stringing machines  bulldozers  bucket trucks  digger derricks  cranes and construction tools 
circumstances often require the company to lease or rent various items of equipment in connection with its work on particular projects 
the terms of these equipment leases and rental agreements are generally related to the length of time to complete the construction contract and sometimes include an option to purchase 
the company generally exercises the lease purchase options with respect to such equipment  and in such cases  usually receives a credit toward the purchase price in the amount of all or a portion of the rentals paid on the lease 
real estate the general offices of the company occupy approximately  square feet of leased space in an office building at west golf road  rolling meadows  illinois 
the lease on these quarters expires in february  rent expense for this property in totaled approximately  the company owns land which at december  aggregated approximately acres

all share and per share data have been adjusted for the four for three stock split in the form of a stock dividend in december and the five for three stock split in the form of a stock dividend in december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations continuing operations revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenue was due to higher storm work  alliance related work and the dw close acquisition in the second quarter of as described in note to the financial statements 
this increase is offset by a decrease in revenues from a major commercial electrical job for a hotel and casino in nevada that was completed in revenues increased by  excluding this project 
revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenues was due to a higher volume of commercial and industrial services  an increase in line work in california and the dw close acquisition described in note to the financial statements 
the commercial and industrial services include a major electrical job for a hotel and casino in nevada that did not have significant revenue until the fourth quarter of the increase is also a result of the company s success at capitalizing on the rapidly growing trend by its customers to outsource their electrical  telecommunication  facility management and mechanical construction and service requirements 
the use of alliances  primarily with our electrical utility customers  continued in in alliances accounted for million of revenues versus million of revenues in clients use alliances to award some or all of their construction requirements to one or more preferred contractors at negotiated prices 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the gross profit percentage increased to in compared to in  in part  due to a lesser percent of our commercial and industrial revenues coming from a significant cost plus fixed fee job 
this type of work generally involves lower financial risk  therefore frequently generates lower margins 
the gross profit percentage also increased due to lower insurance costs as a result of the impact of our safety program on construction costs 
offsetting these increases in gross margin percentages were losses at a recently acquired business doing commercial and industrial electrical work 
the unit  which was acquired as a turnaround opportunity  has made a number of significant changes in its operations 
based on its reorganized management team and excellent client relationships  it is expected to be profitable in gross profit increased to million in from million in due primarily to the growth in revenues 
the gross profit percentage decreased to in  compared to in due  in large part  to a greater percent of our commercial and industrial revenues coming from a significant cost plus fixed fee job 
revenue and gross profit comparisons from quarter to quarter and comparable quarters of different years may be impacted by variables beyond the control of the company due to the nature of the company s work as an outside electrical contractor 
such variables include unusual or unseasonable weather and delays in receipt of construction materials on projects where the materials are provided to the company by its clients 
the client mix of the company s work from period to period can impact gross margin percentage 
as the percent of revenue derived for projects in which the company supplies materials increases  the gross profit percentage will generally decrease 
as the percentage of revenue derived from cost plus work increases  margins may also decrease since this work involves lower financial risk 
finally  since the company s revenues are derived principally from providing construction labor services  insurance costs  particularly for workers compensation  are a significant factor in the company s contract cost structure 
fluctuations in insurance reserves for claims under the high deductible insurance programs can have a significant impact on gross margins  either upward or downward  in the period in which such insurance reserve adjustments are made 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase reflects the inclusion of dw close for a full year  additional compensation and related relocation costs to support the higher volume of work and increased training related costs associated with new management development programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase reflects the inclusion of dw close  additional compensation costs to support the higher volume of work  additional incentive compensation and profit sharing accruals as a result of higher profit levels and additional legal accruals on miscellaneous claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in due to higher consolidated revenue volume spread over a relatively fixed expense base 
net interest expense was million in compared to million in interest expense increased in primarily due to higher average bank debt throughout the year to support working capital needs as a result of the higher volume of work and higher average retention receivable balances relating to the major hotel and casino project in nevada 
net interest expense was million in compared to million in interest expense decreased in primarily due to the decrease in term debt used to acquire harlan 
gains recognized from sales of property and equipment were  and  in and  respectively  compared to losses recognized from sales of property and equipment of  in the gain in the current year is primarily due to the sale of equipment as a result of a program to modernize the equipment fleet and the sale of a facility as a result of consolidating operations 
the loss in was primarily due to the sale and disposal of obsolete and damaged equipment as a result of the program initiated to modernize the equipment fleet 
net other income was  in compared to net other income of  in and to net other expenses of  in the other income represents cash discounts and the reversal of the prior year s accruals for the clean up and move out of an operating unit s facility that were not needed when the property was sold 
this income is offset by bank fee expenses 
the other income includes million relating to the settlement of a lawsuit see note to the financial statements 
offsetting this amount are bank fees  amortization of goodwill  costs accrued for the clean up and move out of an operating unit s facility as a result of consolidating operations and the write off of an investment in land that has never been developed 
income tax expense was million in  million in and million in as a percentage of income the effective rate was for  for and for the company s backlog was million at december   million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the current backlog will be completed within twelve months 
discontinued operations as part of the sale in of its former engineering subsidiary  the company retained certain rights and obligations in connection with a lawsuit with national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh  pa

liquidity and capital resources the company s financial condition continues to be strong at december  with working capital of million as compared to million in and million in the company s debt to equity ratio decreased to at december  from and at december  and  respectively 
working capital increased in mainly as a result of strong operating results that were used to reduce line of credit borrowings 
working capital increased in primarily due to the cash received from the national union settlement see note to the financial statements  acquisition of dw close and the increase in accounts receivable as a result of the higher volume of work 
the acquisition of dw close was completed on may  the purchase price was million 
of this amount  was paid to the dw close shareholder in cash with the remaining million in the form of promissory notes to the seller

the million increase from continuing operations is mainly the result of higher net income and the net proceeds from collecting a significant retention receivable balance  offset by payments of retention to subcontractors on a major hotel and casino project in nevada 
cash flows from operations were million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily the result of the increase in accounts receivable  offset by the proceeds received in the settlement of the national union lawsuit see note to the financial statements

capital expenditures were million in  compared to million in and million in capital expenditures during these periods were used for normal property and equipment additions  replacements and upgrades 
the company plans to spend approximately million on capital improvements in capital expenditures are supplemented with operating leases for construction equipment and real estate see note to the financial statements 
cash flows used for investments in also included  for the acquisition of dw close see note to the financial statements 
cash flows were generated from the disposal of equipment and the sale of a duplicate facility amounting to million in and from the disposal of property and equipment amounting to  in during  the company had million of net repayments of long term debt compared to million of net proceeds from issuance of long term debt in the repayments include million of payments under the terms of debt agreements and million of unscheduled reductions of the line of credit for working capital 
these additional payments are the result of higher cash flow from continuing operations and lower investment cash outflows during the year  as noted above 
during  the company had million of net proceeds from issuance of long term debt compared to repayments on its long term debt of million in the additional proceeds result from increases in the revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs for the higher volume of work  offset by scheduled paydowns in the term loan and proceeds received in the settlement of the national union lawsuit 
the repayments include approximately million in unscheduled reductions of line of credit borrowings 
as noted above  improvements in the net underbillings and proceeds from sales of property and equipment were significant factors that contributed to the company s ability to make these additional debt repayments in cash flows for dividends were   and  in  and  respectively 
year compliance general the year problem arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the extent of the potential impact of the year problem is not yet known  and if not timely corrected  it could affect the global economy 
state of readiness in  the company established an organization wide project to identify non compliant items  formulate corrective actions and to implement these changes to mitigate the year issue 
the company has identified three categories of components that require attention information technology it systems  such as mainframes  midranges  personal computers  software and networks non it systems such as equipment  machinery  climate control  security and telephone systems  which may contain micro controllers with embedded technology third party it and non it systems the table below summarizes the estimated completion percentages of the three categories and stages that are being undertaken to mitigate the year issue 
identification formulation implementation of of of corrective planned material corrective actions completion items actions it systems september  non it systems september  third party systems september  although the company has contacted its major suppliers to determine their readiness regarding the year issue and has been assured that they are working to mitigate its effects  the company has no way of determining what level of compliance they will attain by the year the company is currently in the process of contacting its major customers to evaluate their planned level of compliance 
upon receiving the responses  the company will formulate corrective actions 
there is no guarantee that systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
if all material components are not identified or all appropriate corrective actions are not taken or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
year costs costs related to the year issue are funded through operating cash flows and are being expensed as incurred 
as of december  the company has expended funds in remediation efforts  which consisted of costs associated with modifying the source code of existing software 
this amount has been immaterial to the company 
based upon the company s investigations to date  it estimates the total costs related to the year issue would be immaterial 
a number of other upgrades have been made to systems in the normal course of business that mitigate year issues 
this amount may vary substantially as the company continues to evaluate items associated with the year issue 
year risks the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for the company is the failure of a supplier to be year compliant such that its supply of needed products or services is interrupted temporarily 
this could result in the company not being able to fulfill its obligation on a construction contract  which could cause lost sales and profits and possibly additional exposure for non performance and damage claims 
year contingency plans the company is currently evaluating business disruption scenarios  coordinating the establishment of year contingency plans and identifying and implementing preemptive strategies 
detailed contingency plans for critical business processes will be developed by september the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year project are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions and future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant codes  the level of compliance by key suppliers and customers  and similar uncertainties
