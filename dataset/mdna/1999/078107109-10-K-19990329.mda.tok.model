if any of bell s material third parties are not year ready and their non compliance causes a material disruption to any of their respective businesses  bell s business could be materially adversely affected 
bell will continue to evaluate the nature of these risks  but at this time bell is unable to determine the probability that any such risk will occur  or if it does occur  what the nature  length or other effects  if any  it may have on bell 
if a significant number of material third parties experience failures in their computer systems or operations due to not being year complaint  it could affect bell s ability to process transactions or otherwise engage in similar normal business activities

the company cannot be assured that failure to achieve year compliance will not have a material impact on the company s business
