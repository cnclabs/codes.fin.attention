item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operation except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
castelle s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in the section entitled business risk factors 
results of operations net sales net sales decreased to million in from million in the decline of million in net sales resulted primarily from lower sales of the company s print server products in japan  increases in the sales return allowance during the fourth quarter of of approximately million which allowed the company to better manage the level of inventory in the distribution channel and increases in local competition in europe 
print server product sales declined to million in from million during in  net sales decreased to million from million in the million decline in net sales resulted primarily from lower sales of the company s print server products in japan and europe due to increased local competition  price erosion and a component shortage in the fourth quarter of which impacted the ability of the company to fill orders for print servers 
print server product sales declined to million in from million during approximately  of the shortfall is attributed to the component shortage 
international sales were million  million  and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of net sales in  and lower international sales in and were the result of a reduction in general demand for the company s products in asia and increased local competition in europe 
most of the company s international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
such sales could be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
cost of sales cost of sales includes cost of materials  including components  manuals  diskettes  packaging materials  assembly and shipping  as well as certain royalties 
cost of sales also includes compensation costs and overhead related to the company s manufacturing operations and warranty expenses 
cost of sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and represented  and of net sales for those years 
most significantly  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales remained constant in when compared to this was the result of a higher proportion of net sales being derived from higher margin fax products  including object fax  offset by a lower gross margin percentage on sales of print servers and unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption rates due to lower volumes 
from to  the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to changes in product mix resulting in a higher proportion of net sales being derived from higher margin fax products 
further  in  sales of products acquired from ibex  principally software  helped to favorably impact gross margins 
this improvement was somewhat offset by unfavorable overhead absorption rates  due to lower volumes 
research development research and product development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and represented  and of net sales for those periods 
most of the company s product development efforts during these periods were focused on fax related products  although much of the resultant technology has application to the further development of the company s print server products 
a significant percentage of the company s research and product development expenses are related to software development 
the absolute dollar amount of research and product development expense decreased slightly in due to improved expense controls 
however  the company continues to be committed to the development of highly competitive new products and services through the efficient utilization of its engineering resources 
the increase in research and development expenses in compared to was mainly due to the integration of ibex development efforts 
sales marketing sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively  and represented  and of net sales for those periods 
the expense decline in compared to was due to a reorganization of the sales and marketing activities implemented in the fourth quarter of  resulting in more efficient operations and a smaller staff  which was partially offset by the integration of object fax sales efforts

general administrative general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively  or  and of net sales for those periods 
the increase in expenses in was due to an increase in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts and severance costs associated with executives who left the company  which was only partially offset by expense reductions resulting from the company s restructuring implemented in the fourth quarter of the increase in expenses over expenses was due to increased utilization of professional services and ibex related expenses 
restructuring and other charges amortization of intangible assets in april  the company completed its acquisition of the object fax nt products from tolvusamskipti hf  an icelandic corporation 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development  and  accordingly  the company recorded a one time charge against earnings in the second quarter of of million  as the technology acquired had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the company also recorded intangible assets of  which are being amortized over months  resulting in a  charge in in determining the amount of in process research and development  we engaged an independent valuation firm to conduct an appraisal of the acquired assets 
the intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  were valued based on estimates of future cash flows discounted to their present value at risk adjusted rates of return 
in september  the chief accountant of the sec expressed concerns about the methodologies many companies were using in determining the amount of in process research and development 
an sec working group has been formed to study this issue  however at this time it is unknown what guidelines this group will generate and whether these guidelines will differ from the valuation methods traditionally employed 
the sec s concerns appear to focus on excluding from the valuation the costs of any effort to complete development currently underway and an apportionment of cash flow estimates based on the stage of completion of in process technology 
the company reviewed the original valuation in light of the guidelines suggested by the sec  and does not believe  at this time  that there would be a material change if such guidelines were applied 
see the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded a total restructuring charge of million to restructure its operations to streamline activities and focus on key products to reduce ongoing costs 
of the total restructuring charge  million was to account for implementing and completing the restructuring plan which included relocation of the company s european office  exit from certain lines of business  a workforce reduction  the write off of certain assets relating to ibex and other estimated restructuring costs 
this was in addition to a charge of million associated with the write off of the ibex goodwill and related intangibles 
further  the company recorded amortization expense of  in related to intangible assets associated with the write down to fair market value of assets acquired in the merger with ibex in november in the fourth quarter of  a total of million in other charges was booked due to a million write off of ibex s in process research and development  and  of amortization for the intangible assets and goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of ibex in november interest income  net net interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in and versus the prior years is due to declining cash balances as a result of the losses realized in and provision for benefit from income taxes in the fourth quarter of  due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of favorable tax attributes in future tax returns  the company provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset  resulting in a non recurring  non cash charge of million 
the company recorded a net benefit from income taxes in and of  and million  respectively 
at the time  these amounts reflected the recognition of various deductible deferred assets  including prior years net operating loss carry forwards  business tax credits and various temporary accounting differences 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s provision for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  castelle has funded its operations primarily through the issuance of capital stock and the assumption of bank debt 
as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  down from million for the same period in working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and working capital is primarily due to the operating loss incurred in  cash required to acquire the object fax products and cash utilized to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock during the fourth quarter of the company has a million secured revolving line of credit with a bank  which expired in december  pursuant to which the company may borrow against pledges of cash at the bank s prime rate at december  
borrowings under this line of credit agreement were collateralized by all of the assets of the company 
under the terms of the loan agreement  the company was restricted from loaning money or assets or entering into any mergers or acquisitions where the total consideration exceeds  without the bank s consent 
the company was in compliance with the terms of the agreement  and at december  had no borrowings under the line of credit 
the company is currently negotiating an extension of this line of credit 
in december  as a source of capital asset financing  the company entered into a loan and security agreement with a finance company for an amount up to  as of december   the company had drawn  against this amount of which  is outstanding at december  the loan is subject to an interest rate of  is repayable by december and is collateralized by a certificate of deposit of  which is classified as restricted cash on the company s balance sheet 
as of december    net accounts receivable were million  up from million for the same period in in the average dso was versus at the end of this is the result of a lower proportion of net sales from japan  which historically paid promptly  and an increase by other customers in the amount of time it takes them to pay their bills 
net inventories as of december  were million  down slightly from million in inventory turnover for the year ended was  down from in castelle acquired additional capital equipment of   and  in  and  respectively 
the decline in capital equipment spending in was primarily the result of large one time purchases in for the company s customer support system and an upgrade to the internal network infrastructure 
although the company believes that its existing capital resources and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital requirements at least through the next months  the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for the company s existing and new products and changes in technology in the networking industry 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when needed  if at all 
year issue the company has completed a comprehensive review of its business applications  computer systems and infrastructure and products 
in addition  castelle is in the process of conducting a comprehensive review of its key business partners to identify those that could be adversely affected by the year issue and is developing and implementing a plan to resolve issues identified 
the year issue refers to the inability of many computer systems to process accurately dates later than december  date codes in many programs are abbreviated to allow only two digits for the year  eg for the year unless these programs are modified to handle the century date change  they will likely interpret the year  that is  the year  as the year the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems as well as in computer systems of third parties with whom the company does business worldwide  including banks and credit processing entities  factories  customers and others 
business applications  computer systems and infrastructure castelle has completed a comprehensive review and inventory of its business applications and computer systems  including servers and network infrastructure  to insure that they are year compliant 
to date  the company has installed and or upgraded all computer network file servers and infrastructure hubs  switches  modems and access devices to hardware and software that is certified to be year compliant by its vendors 
in addition  castelle s main business application from computer associates international  inc computer associates has been upgraded to a year compliant version as certified by computer associates 
during the next three months the company expects to complete an upgrade of all desktop including laptop computers to microsoft nt software certified by microsoft corporation as year compliant 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company due to planned modifications to existing software and conversions to new software which have been implemented or are being implemented by the company over the next year 
key business partners the company is in the process of conducting a comprehensive review of its key business partners  including customers  suppliers and vendors  to identify those critical to the success of the company s operations that may have year issues which could adversely affect the operations of the company 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company due to planned modifications by our key business partners to their existing systems and conversions to new software which have been implemented or are being implemented by the company s key business partners over the next year 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue may have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the company cannot give assurance the third parties with whom it does business will address any year issues in their own systems on a timely basis 
costs the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
at the present time  all costs associated with the installation and upgrading of equipment and software have been related to routine upgrades of the company s business systems  which to date have been approximately  however  the company cannot give any assurance that significant costs associated with unforeseen circumstances will not significantly affect the future results of the company 
products the company has completed a comprehensive review of its products  both firmware and software  to insure that they are year compliant 
this was done to insure that the company s products are free of any year issues discussed above 
the company believes that the more recent versions of its products are year compliant  meaning the products will perform functions correctly when processing dates later than december  in order to avoid difficulties  users will need to install the versions of the company s software that are year compliant 
for example  faxpress systems require the use of a software and firmware release of at least version and infopress requires that at least version be installed for compliance with year requirements 
full details on year compliance of the company s products are available on the company s web site 
the company provides upgrade kits to allow customers to install these versions 
the company s products work in conjunction with network operating systems such as novell netware and microsoft windows nt  and while these products appear to be year compliant  the company cannot accept responsibility for year compliance of any network operating system 
if modifications or upgrades to these network operating systems are not completed in a timely fashion  the year issue may have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
contingency plans the company is in the process of developing contingency plans in the event that the company s systems or products prove to not be year compliant 
the company is currently reviewing its key business activities to develop plans to support ongoing business operations in the event of a disruption and expects these plans to be completed shortly 
however  the company cannot give any assurance that these contingency plans will be effective in preventing year related disruptions in the business which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company considered the provision of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  however  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
while much of the company s revenue is transacted in u 
s dollars  some revenues and capital spending are transacted in pounds sterling 
these amounts are not currently material to the financial statements of castelle  therefore we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially affect the company s overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value of the company s money market account or related income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to the highly liquid nature of this investment 
however  sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings on this account
