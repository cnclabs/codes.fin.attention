the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its loan portfolio  securities and other earning assets  and its cost of funds  consisting of interest paid on its deposits and borrowings 
the company s operating results are also impacted by provisions for loan losses  and to a lesser extent service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income 
in addition  the company s operating expenses principally consist of salaries  wages and employee benefits  occupancy expenses  professional services and other general noninterest expenses 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates and actions of regulatory authorities

net interest income a significant component of the company s operations is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees received on earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of average total interest earning assets  is referred to as the net interest margin 
the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and other borrowed funds 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with the prime rate

average balances are primarily computed on daily balances during the period 
when such balances are not available  averages are computed on a monthly basis 
the net interest margin for a period is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
net interest income before provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from december  the increase in net interest income is primarily the result of a or  increase in average interest earnings assets  offset by a decrease in the yield on average interest earnings assets which declined to for the period ended december  from for the same period in further  net interest income was positively impacted by a  or decrease in average interest bearing liabilities outstanding during the period ended december  as compared to the same period in net interest income before provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was  and  at december  in net interest margin was impacted by a decline in average interest earning assets  which declined  or  from  at december  to  at december  in addition  the yield on average interest earning assets increased basis points to from at december  and  respectively 
the primary decline in average interest earning assets in was in average securities  which declined  from december  to december  analysis of changes in net interest income the company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume change 
it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and interest rates paid on interest bearing deposits and other borrowed funds  referred to as a rate change 
the following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the years indicated 
the changes due to rate and volume have been allocated to rate and volume in proportion to the relationship between their absolute dollar amounts

securities were sold during to reflect the decreased deposit base as well as the restructuring of the investment securities portfolio 
a changing interest rate environment may have a significant impact on the company s net interest margin as measured against average interest earning assets 
management monitors the company s net interest margin by utilizing an interest rate simulation model under various interest rate scenarios 
this process quantifies the impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest margin 
interest rate scenarios are increased and decreased up to basis points in determining the impact on net interest income 
these results provide a basis for repricing loan and deposit products after giving consideration to such factors as competition  the economic environment and expected maturities in the loan  investment securities and deposit portfolios 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is determined by management based upon the company s loan loss experience  the performance of loans in the company s portfolio  the quality of loans in the company s portfolio  evaluation of collateral for such loans  the economic conditions affecting collectibility of loans  the prospects and financial condition of the respective borrowers or guarantors and such other factors which in management s judgment deserve recognition in the estimation of probable loan losses 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance or to take charge offs reductions in the allowance in anticipation of losses 
the provision for loan losses for was   for and  for the increase in the provision for loan losses in as compared to is in response to growth in the loan portfolio and increases in nonperforming loans in the fourth quarter of the decrease in the provision for loan losses in as compared to  was a result of an overall improvement in the loan portfolio as a result of improved credit administration practices

lines of credit include equity lines  overdraft protection lines and other secured  collateralized and unsecured lines of credit 
installment loans include automobile and boat loans and other loans for personal and corporate use 
the interest rates charged for the loans made by the company vary with the degree of risk  the size and maturity of the loan  the borrowers depository relationships with the company  and prevailing market rates 
although the risk of non payment exists with respect to all types of loans  certain other specific risks are associated with each type of loan 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans  including real estate secured commercial loans  are the quality of the borrower s management and a number of economic and other factors  including competition  insufficient capital  changes in laws and regulations and general changes in the marketplace  which induce business failures and cause the value of business assets pledged to secure the loan to depreciate 
although the company s portfolio concentration in the health care services industry may expose the company to risks or adverse developments in this sector  including any such developments resulting from health care reform  these risks are mitigated in part by the diversity of clientele within the market niche 
equity lines of credit  installment loans and other lines of credit are affected primarily by domestic instability and a variety of factors that may lead to the borrower s unemployment  including deteriorating economic conditions in one or more segments of a local or broader economy 
the following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by type of credit extension as of the dates indicated

commercial loans represent extensions to a wide array of individuals  companies  both within and outside of the company s market area 
in addition  there were no construction loans outstanding at december  or the company generally underwrites loans on the basis of adequate cash flow  historical  current and as appropriate pro forma  and looks to supporting collateral as a secondary source of repayment in most extensions 
in the opinion of management  the company s loan policies conform with applicable regulatory lending standards 
commercial loans and real estate secured commercial loans at december  the company s commercial and real estate secured commercial loans totaled  or of total loans compared to  or of total loans at december  total real estate secured commercial loans were  at december  and  at december  commercial and real estate secured commercial loans consist primarily of short to medium term financing for small to medium sized health care related companies and professionals located in southern california 
the commercial and real estate secured commercial loans are primarily concentrated in the same sectors of the medical community as the company s deposit base is drawn from and consists of sole medical practitioners  small groups practices  large single specialty groups  multi specialty medical groups and other outpatient health care service companies 
real estate transactions are underwritten with cash flow adequacy and diversity as the primary underwriting criteria 
although collateral offered provides adequate secondary support  the underwriting additionally considers other assets net worth available to support repayment 
approximately of total loans at december  were commercial loans which were unsecured or collateralized by various business and personal property assets  including equipment  accounts receivable contracts  and proceeds thereof  including capitation payments 
as a matter of policy  the company s commercial loan borrowers are required to submit financial statements and other financial data for example  accounts receivable agings and enrollment summaries on a periodic basis  in conformity with loan policies and procedures and regulatory guidelines  to loan officers for their review in monitoring the financial position and cash flows trends of borrowers 
under this policy  management generally places a higher level of scrutiny on borrowers failing to submit the required financial information 
senior lending officers review delinquency reports  overdrafts  borrowers payment histories and periodic financial data to monitor creditworthiness and identify potential problem loans 
loan to value ratios on commercial loans secured by real estate generally range from approximately to at origination 
the company s real estate secured commercial loans are repaid typically through cash flows from the borrowers business with shorter term maturities three to five years and amortizations usually no longer than years and are not classified by the company as real estate mortgage loans 
equity lines of credit at december  and  equity lines of credit aggregated approximately  or of total loans  and  or of total loans  respectively

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit for working capital  tenant improvements  other term purposes and include standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional principal amount of those instruments 
however  other than letters of credit  all such documents contain legal language that would allow the company an ability for non advance 
accordingly  loss potential is minimized for commitments extended under such document 
at december  and  the company had commitments to extend credit of approximately  and  respectively  and obligations under standby letters of credit of approximately  and  respectively 
standby letters of credit are commitments issued by the company to support the performance of a client to a third party 
those standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  lease arrangements and similar transactions 
all such standby letters of credit are extended for a period of two years or less 
in making commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses credit policies similar to those used in connection with extension of credit to all customers with creditworthiness evaluated on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on a credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  contract  contract rights and income producing commercial real estate 
credit risk management and asset quality management believes that the objective of sound credit policy is to extend loans to qualified customers while managing risks which could affect shareholders returns 
the loan committee  made up of outside members of the board of directors of the bank and executive management  approve credit policy  review asset quality  and determine compliance to credit policy and procedure 
management periodically reviews loan quality and monitors the progress of watch list loans  some of which may require an action plan for rehabilitation or refinancing 
in addition  credit underwriting guidelines are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current economic conditions  industry practices and regulatory guidelines 
in accordance with management s credit administration and regulatory policy  loans are placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal or interest is questionable 
generally  this means that loans are put on nonaccrual status when interest is days or more past due  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
the table below sets forth information about nonperforming assets  which included nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned oreo  and accruing loans days or more past due and certain ratios december  in thousands nonperforming assets nonperforming loans     other real estate owned oreo other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets      accruing loans days or more past due nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total loans to total loans  oreo and repossessed assets to total assets nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets do not include accruing loans days or more past due where the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
allowance for loan losses management s determination of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the both actual and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
actual results may  however  differ significantly from such estimates 
in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses where real estate secures the loan  management generally obtains independent appraisals for all properties 
management believes its current appraisal policy conforms to regulatory guidelines 
an evaluation of the overall quality of the portfolio is performed at least quarterly to determine the level of the allowance for loan losses 
this evaluation takes into consideration the classification of loans and the application of loss estimates attributable to these classifications 
the company classifies loans as pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss based on classification criteria believed by management to be consistent with the criteria applied by regulatory agencies and consistent with sound banking practices 
these classifications and loss estimates take into consideration all sources of repayment  underlying collateral  the value of such collateral  current and anticipated economic conditions  trends  and uncertainties and the historical accuracy of specific reserves attached to loans with serious perceived weakness 
additionally  the company utilizes migration analysis as another means to assist management in estimating the level of the allowance for loan losses 
migration analysis is a statistical method which examines historic charge off and classification trends prior to charge off to estimate potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the above processes provide management with a reasonable basis to estimate the risk both actual and inherent in the portfolio 
in addition  the company utilizes a comprehensive program that considers numerous variables  of which migrations is one  to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for reserves nonspecific to certain credits 
this program is consistent with methodologies in banking circular amongst others  consideration is given to historical and current trends in past due loans  charged off loans  nonaccruals  and the nature and mix of the loan portfolio  and local  regional  industry  and national economic trends in determining loan loss adequacy 
finally  credit administration  corresponding loan policies and procedures  and timely problem loan identification are integral to a sound determination of the allowance for loan losses 
based on information available at december   management was of the opinion that a  allowance for loan losses  which constitutes of total loans  was adequate as an allowance against probable and estimable losses 
while the company s policy is to charge off in the current period those loans for which a loss is considered probable  there also exists the risk of future losses which cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans 
as this risk is continually changing in response to factors beyond the control of the company  such as the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in future periods  while approximate  is in part based on a reasonable methodology 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to record additions or deletions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following tables provide a summary of the company s allowance for loan losses and charge off and recovery activity

risk based capital standards were implemented on december  since december   banking organizations have been expected to meet a minimum ratio for qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  of which must be tier capital 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and risk weighted off balance sheet items 
although the company and the bank at december  were considered well capitalized and exceeded all applicable minimum capital requirements  the capital requirements of the federal banking regulators could limit the company s future growth if the company were to rely solely on the retention of earnings to generate additional capital or rapid growth

warrants in connection with a private placement of common stock the private placement  the company issued i a warrant to robert h 
leshner  principal of the placement agent  to purchase  shares of common stock the leshner warrant and ii warrants to each of andrew e 
haas and curtis swindal to purchase  shares of common stock  each at a purchase price of per share exercisable in full on or after december  and before december  the company agreed to grant the holders of the shares issued upon exercise of the warrant warrant shares the right  on two occasions during the five year period beginning december   to require the company to register the demand registration the warrant shares under the act 
the company will pay the expenses of one demand registration 
assuming the demand registration could be filed under a form  such expense would be minimal 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the leshner warrant  if dr 
joel w 
kovner  former chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company  dies before december   then the company will purchase  at the option of mr 
leshner  some or all of the warrants and or warrant shares then owned by mr 
leshner  provided that i the maximum aggregate purchase price paid by the company shall be not more than  and ii the funds to purchase such warrants and or warrant shares shall come solely from the proceeds of the key person insurance policy on dr 
kovner 
since such life insurance is in excess of the cash value recognized on the company s balance sheet  there would be no net reduction in capital nor any impact on liquidity 
furthermore  if at any time prior to december   mr 
leshner wishes to sell some or all of the warrants and or warrant shares to a third party  mr 
leshner must offer to sell such warrants and or warrant shares to the company on the same terms and conditions being offered to such third party 
another term of the leshner warrant restricts the company s ability to issue certain types of preferred stock which would entitle the holders thereof to receive dividends or distributions of assets which vary in amount with the company s performance 
interest rate sensitivity an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or can experience an interest rate change 
as interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities have various repricings and maturities  changes in interest rates may increase or decrease the bank s net interest income 
this exposure to changes in interest rates is measured among other methodologies by an institutions gap  or the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified periods of time 
an excess of maturing or repricing assets over maturing or repricing liabilities during a given period will serve to increase net interest income in a rising rate environment and decrease net interest income when interest rates decline 
in a rising interest rate environment  the assets will reprice at current interest rates earlier than the liabilities thus increasing the bank s net interest margin 
conversely  when maturing or repricing liabilities exceed maturing or repricing assets during a given period  a rising interest rate environment generally will reduce the bank s net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of december  the table also sets forth the time period in which assets and liabilities will mature or reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
mortgage backed securities provide cash flows on a monthly basis  however  this analysis does not include prepayment assumptions 
prepayments assumptions are utilized in an interest rate simulation model which is routinely used by the company in evaluating the impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income

the company desired to maintain the existing spread between a portion of its repricing liabilities and its repriceable assets and subsequently  entered into an interest rate exchange agreement in may with a notional amount of  this swap is intended to protect against the rise of deposit costs relative to the prime rate 
under the terms of the basic swap  for a period of five years  the company pays an interest rate of prime rate less basis points while receiving the three month london interbank offered rate libor 
because the company s repricing liabilities typically move to a lesser degree than does the three month libor  the terms of the original swap included limits on the interest rate to be received by the company 
this feature of the swap required mark to market accounting and the company terminated this feature of the swap and recorded a pre tax expense of  in although this swap reduces current earnings  the management of the company believes this reduction in earnings is justified by the protection against a narrowing spread 
as additional protection against lower interest rates  in december and january  the company entered into three interest rate floor contracts with a notional amount of  the agreements entitled the company to receive from counterparties on a monthly basis the amounts  if any  by which the one month libor rate falls below 
the floor agreements were for a period of three years 
the average premium paid for the floor agreements was approximately basis points or  and was being amortized over three years 
in may  the company sold the floor contracts for total consideration of  this amount is being amortized over the original three year term 
in order to protect the fair value of a portion of the company s gnma variable rate securities  in december  the company purchased two interest rate caps with a notional amount  each 
the agreements entitled the company to receive from counterparties on a quarterly basis the amounts  if any  by which the one year cmt rate rises above for one of the agreements and on the other 
the cap agreements are for a period of three years 
the average premium paid for the cap agreements was basis points or  which is being amortized over the three year period 
liquidity adequate liquidity and maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest rate sensitive earning assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities are the principal imperatives associated with the asset liability management function of a financial institution 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of clients who may be depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
aside from asset liability management  the company maintains short term sources of funds to meet periodic planned and unplanned increases in loan demand and deposit withdrawals and maturities 
the initial source of liquidity is the excess funds sold daily to other banks in the form of federal funds 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  the company maintains a large percentage of its assets in investment securities 
these securities include both securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 
securities available for sale can be sold in response to liquidity needs or used as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements 
securities held to maturity are available for liquidity needs solely as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements 
the company had no reverse repurchase agreements on december  and as evidence of the company s high level of liquidity at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  while securities available for reverse repurchase agreements totaled approximately  the combined amount of  represents approximately of the company s total assets 
management is of the opinion that the existing level of liquidity and borrowing capacity is sufficient to insulate the bank against unforeseen liquidity demands 
on a stand alone basis  the company s primary source of liquidity is dividends from the bank 
dividends by the bank to the company are subject to regulatory restrictions 
for further information on the bank s dividend restrictions  see business supervision and regulation restrictions on dividends and other distributions and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year the year issue presents a very real and significant challenge to the company  along with the entire financial services industry 
this problem has the potential to affect a wide range of systems and equipment  including software and hardware  utilities  communications platforms and devices  and facilities 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to represent the calendar year 
software so developed and not corrected could produce inaccurate or unpredictable results when dates change in the year such occurrences may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or business as the company  like most financial organizations  is significantly subject to the potential year issues due to the nature of financial information 
while no one can accurately predict what will happen with the date change to the year  the company s management and board of directors take the potential risks seriously  and have been working since early in  and will continue to work hard  to be prepared for the year transition 
there are a number of broad concerns that may affect the company  our customers  and business partners 
in the event of a year failure  the company could be adversely impacted in a number of ways 
internal operations problems and problems resulting from primary vendors and suppliers inability to perform could cause increased costs in determining correct results and lost customers resulting in lost revenue 
large customers negatively effected by year problems could lead to deposit outflows or increased risk of collecting loans 
as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with government regulatory standards and establish prudent business practices for year issues  the board of directors and senior management have previously developed and approved a year preparedness plan  which is currently being implemented 
the company s year risk mitigation program is a dynamic process of reassessment  evaluation and testing 
as a result  responses may change especially as vendors and manufacturers find and report year product and services issues 
the following outlines major areas within the plan and provides the status of our efforts awareness our plan provides for a year task force which reports at least quarterly reporting to the audit committee and board of directors of the company 
the task force  which meets monthly  consists of members of senior management representatives from key areas within the company 
the task force  among other roles  monitors and report progress  and provides direction toward preparation for the year date change 
assessment the task force has developed an overall strategy which identifies and categorizes internal information and operating systems  and external vendors  customers  auditors and business partners  according to risk of business disruption 
each operating system  process  vendor  or other business partner is risk assessed based upon the impact on the company s business 
high risk processes and systems have been categorized as mission critical and have been prioritized in our year risk mitigation process 
testing plans have been developed  and we have completed testing all mission critical and many other identified systems 
the testing of all systems is scheduled to be completed by june  we have identified contingency plans and alternatives  including replacement or elimination  for mission critical systems and other systems in the event that such actions become necessary 
also  we have integrated the year business risks into our overall bankwide business resumption plans 
we will test mission critical and other systems on an ongoing basis to reasonably determine that they will continue to operate after the year in addition  as a lending institution  the company is exposed to potential risk if it s customers suffer year related difficulties 
therefore  we have developed  and implemented  a process to assess the potential risks to the company of both our lending and deposit customer s preparedness for the year date change 
also  potential borrower s readiness for year is assessed and included within the credit underwriting and approval process 
remediation the remediation phase includes upgrading or replacing information or operating systems  vendor certifications  and other associated changes 
we have begun renovation of systems  including non information technology systems  that have been identified as non compliant to year  including replacing some personal computers  or upgrading software and other operating systems 
the renovation of mission critical systems where indicated is complete 
the extent of our identified renovation needs have been budgeted within our corporate budgeting process 
the remaining system renovation is anticipated to be complete by june  additionally  we have received vendor responses or certification for all of our mission critical systems  along with most of our other information and operating systems 
these responses are monitored continually to determine the vendors progress toward preparedness 
validation implementation as operating systems are validated  upgraded  and successfully tested the systems are integrated into ongoing operations 
as with any new system  or system change  internal external users are provided training  connectivity with other systems is determined and integration into current processes occurs 
validation and implementation of mission critical systems was completed by december  in addition  we have instituted an independent third party review of our year efforts for all mission critical systems 
significant progress has been accomplished in our efforts to prepare for the year century date change 
all of our mission critical systems have been tested and none have failed 
additionally  we are complete assessing  renovating  testing and implementing year preparedness for all other identified systems 
management currently estimates the overall cost of year risk mitigation not to exceed  in operating expenses and  in fixed asset purchases of which approximately has been incurred 
these costs are included within our ongoing budget and planning process 
we continue with the execution of our year preparedness plan and remain on schedule to meet our internal timeline and regulatory expectations and continue to project that we will complete renovation and implementation prior to june  also  we have developed and presented internal and external awareness programs  which reinforce the awareness and the need for preparedness to the year problem for the company s board of directors  employees  and our customers 
based upon the information we have developed through our year preparedness plan  we have not identified risks associated with the date change to year that will have a material financial impact on the company
