item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto 
the discussion of results  causes and trends should not be construed to infer any conclusion that such results  causes or trends will necessarily continue in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the past three years  the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses other income  net of interest expense earnings before income taxes income tax provision net earnings the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage increase or decrease of certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
increase from prior period compared compared with with net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales net sales increased from to from approximately million to million 
the company attributes this increase primarily to sales growth of network magnetic products and telecom magnetic products recently acquired from lucent  offset  in part  by reduced sales of value added modules 
net sales increased from to from approximately million to million 
the company attributes this increase primarily to sales growth of network magnetic products and fuse products  offset  in part  by reduced sales of value added modules 
such reduced sales reflect the termination of certain contracts 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in the decrease in the cost of sales percentage is primarily attributable to lower material content and lower overhead and labor costs principally due to higher sales volume 
the company regularly reviews its inventory for slow moving  obsolete and over stocked inventory 
as at december  the inventory reserve for those items was approximately  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in the decrease in the cost of sales percentage is primarily attributable to lower material content offset  in part  by increases in direct labor costs due to the then current sales mix which was more labor intensive and to a lesser extent increases in overheads required to support the increase in unit production 
the company regularly reviews its inventory for slow moving  obsolete and over stocked inventory 
as at december  the inventory reserve for those items was approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses the percentage relationship of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales remained relatively constant  decreasing from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in dollar amount by 
the company attributes the increase in dollar amount of such expenses primarily to increases in sales and marketing salaries and sales related expenses  recruitment expenses to staff the signal transformer product line and  to a lesser extent  amortization of goodwill acquired from lucent 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the percentage relationship of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales increased from in to in the company attributes the increase primarily to increases in sales salaries and sales related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in dollar amount by 
the company attributes the increase in dollar amount of such expenses primarily to increased sales and increases in sales salaries and sales related expenses and to a lesser extent increased professional fees and severance expenses 
other income and expenses  gain on sale other income  consisting principally of interest and dividends earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities  increased by approximately  from the year to the increase is primarily due to higher earnings on invested funds due to greater average balances in compared to  offset  in part  by the use of cash and cash equivalents used in the acquisition of the signal transformer business from lucent 
other income decreased by  from the year to the decrease is primarily due to the gain on the sale of  shares of technitrol  inc common stock recognized during the year  offset  in part  by higher earnings on invested funds due to greater average balances in compared to provision for income taxes the company has historically followed a practice of reinvesting a portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the expansion of its foreign operations 
if the unrepatriated earnings were distributed to the parent corporation rather than reinvested in the far east  such funds would be subject to united states federal income taxes 
no earnings were repatriated during   or the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations 
the provision for incomes taxes in was  as compared to  in the increase in the provision is due primarily to higher earnings before income taxes in versus  offset  in part  by certain recruitment expenses and the amortization of goodwill incurred in the us in connection with the signal transformer product line acquired from lucent and lower foreign income tax rates 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the provision for income taxes in was  as compared to  in this decrease is due primarily to lower united states earnings before income taxes for the year versus the company s effective tax rate has been lower than the statutory united states corporate rate primarily as a result of the lower tax rates in hong kong and macau 
inflation during the past two years  the effect of inflation on the company s profitability was not material 
historically  fluctuations of the us dollar against other major currencies have not significantly affected the company s foreign operations as most transactions have been denominated in us dollars or currencies linked to the us dollar 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its capital expenditures through cash flows from operating activities 
management believes that the cash flow from operations  combined with its existing capital base and the company s available lines of credit  will be sufficient to funds its operations for the near term 
the company has lines of credit  all of which were unused at december   in the aggregate amount of million  of which million is from domestic banks and million is from foreign banks 
on february   the company signed a letter of commitment to increase the domestic lines of credit to million 
during the company s cash decreased by million  reflecting a million cash payment for the acquisition of the signal transformer business from lucent and million in purchase of plant and equipment  offset by million provided by operating activities and million provided by the exercise of incentive stock options and contractor repayments 
cash and accounts receivable comprised approximately and of the company s total assets at december  and  respectively 
the company s working capital ratio ie  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to and to at december  and  respectively 
other matters year background the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable years 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company relies heavily on computer technologies to operate its business 
in the company conducted an initial assessment of its information technology to determine which year related problems might cause processing errors or computer system failures 
the company also did a complete analysis of its computer system 
based on the results of that analysis  the company s executive management identified the year problem as a top corporate priority and established a team to provide a solution 
based on the team s evaluation  it was also decided to upgrade the entire computer system at the same time as solving the year problem 
though the cost of the year problem is not material  the estimate for evaluation and remediation of the system software and the upgrading of the computer system  including the solution for the year problem  is approximately  the following discussion of the implications of the year problem for the company contains numerous forward looking statements based on inherently uncertain information 
the cost of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete its internal year modifications are based on the company s best estimates  which were derived utilizing a number of assumptions of future events including the continued availability of internal and external resources  third party modifications and other factors 
however  there can be no assurances that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ 
moreover  although the company believes it will be able to make the necessary modifications in advance  there can be no assurances that failure to modify the systems would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company places a high degree of reliance on computer systems of third parties  such as customers  trade suppliers and computer hardware and commercial software suppliers 
although the company is assessing the readiness of these third parties and preparing contingency plans  there can be no guarantee that the failure of these third parties to modify their systems in advance of december   would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
readiness the company s year project is intended to ensure that all critical systems  devices and applications  as well as data exchanged with customers  trade suppliers and other third parties have been evaluated and will be suitable for continued use into and beyond the year responsibility for implementation of the project was assigned to an internal team of the company 
general priorities were defined  dependencies identified  preliminary delivery dates assigned  detailed project plans developed  and internal and external technical resources assigned or hired 
in addition  internal management reporting requirements were established 
plans and progress against these plans were reviewed by the company s chief financial officer 
the company has completed the majority of the project and is on schedule to be in full compliance during during  the company will continue to conduct a rigorous final level of review called integrated testing under post year conditions 
since early  the company has required year compliance statements from all suppliers of the company s computer hardware and commercial software 
regardless of the compliance statements  all third party hardware and software will also be subjected to testing to reconfirm the year readiness 
cost the company estimates that the total cost of achieving year readiness for its internal systems  devices and applications will be approximately  this statement is a forward looking statement subject to the risks set forth below 
year project costs are difficult to estimate accurately  and the projected cost could change due to unanticipated technological difficulties and year readiness of third parties 
contingency plans in the event that the efforts of the company s year project do not address all potential systems problems  the company is currently developing business interruption contingency plans  including maintaining the company s old computer system which was not subject to the year problem  using alternative machinery and equipment  and having a back up system at an offsite location 
the company believes  however  that due to the widespread nature of potential year issues  the contingency planning process is an ongoing one which will require further modifications as the company obtains additional information regarding the company s internal systems during the remediation and final testing phases of its year project and the status of third party year readiness 
contingency planning for possible year disruptions will continue to be defined  improved and implemented 
risks the company believes that completed and planned modifications and conversions of its critical systems  devices and applications will allow it to be year compliant in a timely manner 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company s internal systems  devices and applications or those of third parties on which the company relies will be year compliant by year or that the company s or third parties contingency plans will mitigate the effects of any noncompliance 
an interruption of the company s ability to conduct its business due to a year readiness problem could have a material adverse effect on the company 
territories of hong kong  macau and the people s republic of china the territory of hong kong reverted to the people s republic of china pursuant to a long term land lease which expired in the middle of the territory of macau will revert to the people s republic of china at the end of management cannot presently predict what impact  if any  the expiration of these leases will have on the company or how the political climate in china will affect its contractual arrangements in china 
substantially all of the company s manufacturing operations and approximately of its identifiable assets are located in hong kong  macau  and the people s republic of china 
accordingly  events resulting from the expiration of such leases as well as any change in the most favored nation status granted to china by the us could have a material adverse effect on the company
