item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview promedco is a medical services company that manages and coordinates the delivery of healthcare in secondary markets 
by affiliating with leading primary care driven  multi specialty physician groups  the company establishes dominant  local healthcare delivery platforms thus providing physicians the opportunity for increasing control of medical expenditures in their communities 
promedco commenced operations in december and affiliated with its initial physician group in june the company s rapid growth during  and has resulted from its strong same net revenue market growth consistently exceeding  with the balance of the growth coming from affiliations with additional physician groups 
the groups expand through affiliations with additional primary care physicians and specialists and selective additions of ancillary services 
in addition to providing operating and expansion capital  the company provides its affiliated groups with a broad range of strategic and management expertise and services 
the company currently is affiliated with multi specialty physician groups in states  comprised of approximately physicians and mid level providers primarily physician assistants and nurse practitioners  and is associated with physicians in associated independent practice association ipa networks 
the company also offers a full range of medical management services to capitated physician networks 
utilizing sophisticated information systems  promedco provides a full range of managed care services to capitated providers  including clinical quality assessment  credentialing  claims processing and payment  referral and utilization management  and case management to its associated ipas and to those of its affiliated groups that have entered into capitation arrangements  together covering over  managed care capitated lives 
when affiliating with a physician group  the company generally acquires at fair market value the group s non real estate operating assets and enters into a year service agreement with the group in exchange for a combination of common stock  cash  other securities of the company  and or the assumption of certain liabilities 
the company is continually seeking additional physician groups with which to affiliate and at any time is typically engaged in negotiations with several such groups 
the company s net revenue represents the revenue of the physician groups reported at the estimated realizable amounts from patients  third party payors  and others for services rendered  net of contractual and other adjustments and is further reduced by the amounts paid to physician groups 
the amounts paid to physician groups typically of the physician groups operating income pursuant to the service agreements primarily consist of the cost of the affiliated physician services 
under the service agreements  the company provides each physician group with the facilities and equipment used in its medical practice  assumes responsibility for the management of the operations of the practice  and employs substantially all of the non physician personnel utilized by the group 
the company does not consolidate the operating results and accounts of the physician groups under eitf  applications of fasb no 
and apb no 
to physician practice management entities and certain other entities under contracted management agreement 
operating expenses consist of the expenses incurred by the company in fulfilling its obligations under the service agreements 
these expenses are the same as the operating costs and expenses that would have been incurred by the affiliated groups  including non physician salaries  employee benefits  medical supplies  purchased medical services  building rent  equipment leases  malpractice insurance premiums  management information systems  and other expenses related to clinic operations 
because of the significance of individual group affiliations and the level of capitation and other revenues  expense ratios and operating margins will vary with each new affiliation 
the mix of physician specialties and ancillary services affects the level of clinic salaries and benefits and clinic supplies  and the margins on capitated revenues generally are lower than those on fee for service revenues although capitated revenues can provide incremental profit with little or no additional capital investment 
generally  primary care and office based physician practices require a higher number of support staff than specialty care or hospital based practices 
clinic rent and lease expense as a percentage of physician groups revenue will vary based on the size of each affiliated group s offices  the current market rental rate for medical office space in the particular geographic markets and the amount of medical and other equipment under lease 
capitation arrangements may require the purchase of medical services that are not provided by the group accepting capitation 
these purchased medical services may include hospitalization  emergency room care and other technical or specialty services 
the ratio of purchased medical services to associated capitation revenues will vary depending upon the terms of the individual contracts and the amount of services that can be provided by the particular group 
other clinic costs will vary as a percentage of physician groups revenue based on regional cost differences and the company s ability to implement operational efficiencies and negotiate more favorable purchasing arrangements 
in addition to the clinic expenses discussed above  the company incurs personnel and administrative expenses in connection with maintaining a corporate office function that provides management  administrative and acquisition services to its affiliated groups 
the company s profitability depends on  among other things  increasing market share  expanding healthcare services  enhancing operating efficiencies  and maintaining favorable contractual relationships with payors 
for the year ended december   two of the company s affiliated physician groups each contributed or more of the company s net revenue 
clinics in champaign  il  and pittsfield  ma  represented approximately and of net revenue  respectively 
in addition to managing its affiliated physician groups  the company manages an ipa in maine and new hampshire 
revenues from this ipa consist of capitation and risk pool payments under managed care contracts with hmos 
such revenues represent less than of total net revenue 
related operating expenses consist of the cost of providing the medical services required by the hmo members covered by the contracts  and are reflected primarily as purchased medical services 
results of operations the company commenced operations in december and affiliated with its first physician group in june and its second group in december the company entered into affiliations with five additional groups during  seven additional groups during  and with eight additional groups in changes in results of operations were caused primarily by affiliations with these additional physician groups

the year problem is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in the same way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its information systems and operations using both internal and external resources 
the company divides its internal procession software into three broad categories financial including general ledger  accounts payable  fixed assets  purchasing and inventory control  practice management including billing and accounts receivable and managed care 
the company has installed a new  common financial software package at all locations that is certified year compliant 
the company s philosophy with respect to practice management systems is to utilize the legacy system in place as long as it can capably serve the physicians needs 
of the company s existing affiliated groups  only three locations are utilizing practice management systems that are not currently year compliant 
two of these locations have been scheduled for system conversions and upgrades in the second quarter of to handle increased patient volume 
these planned conversions will be year compliant 
the third location utilizes on a system maintained by a local hospital  promedco is working with the hospital to complete year testing during the second quarter of the year assessment process continues with each new affiliation 
inadequate or noncompliant practice management systems could be acquired in a new affiliation  which would require system remediation or replacement 
given these issues  the company is currently unable to estimate the costs of the remediation or replacements that may be required during with its current strategy of replacing inadequate practice management systems  however  the company does not believe that year issues will cause a conversion of one or more of its practice management systems to be more or less difficult than a typical system conversion 
the company s primary managed care technology resides at its risk management subsidiary  pmc medical management pmc 
pmc is currently upgrading its systems to be year compliant 
this process is expected to be completed in the second quarter of and the costs are not currently estimated to be material 
the company is also in the process of gathering information about the year compliance status of its significant suppliers and vendors 
the inability of suppliers and vendors to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the potential effect on the company of non compliance by suppliers and vendors has not yet been determined management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases  the company s ability to record revenue or process collections in a timely fashion would be adversely impacted after january  in addition  disruptions in the general economy due to the year problem could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of its year program 
the company plans to evaluate the status of its efforts in june to determine whether such a plan is necessary 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of million  compared to million at december  this increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of current assets primarily accounts receivable in excess of current liabilities assumed in new affiliations 
about of this increase resulted from an increase in accounts receivable in affiliations where promedco did not buy the existing accounts receivable of the group see discussion below 
although each new affiliation will have its own specific structure  the company typically acquires current assets well in excess of the current liabilities it assumes 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  amounted to million 
this is primarily attributable to a ramp up in accounts receivable of approximately million in physician group affiliations completed in the fourth quarter of and during  where the company did not acquire the medical group s existing accounts receivable 
overall  net accounts receivable of million at december  amounted to days of net physician groups revenue excluding other revenues for the fourth quarter of while this measure of net accounts receivable has risen since the first quarter of  when days outstanding was days  the increase in days outstanding can be attributed  in part  to the ramp up in accounts receivable for the affiliations discussed above  as well as increases resulting from changes in payor mix  most notably in medicare medicaid from in to in net income  combined with depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes  and an increase in payable to affiliated physician groups  accrued expenses and other current liabilities provided million in cash flows
