this restriction or potential loss of the availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the general partner and the partnership  however  criimi mae has not historically represented a significant source of capital for the general partner or the partnership

year the year issue is a computer programming issue that may affect many electronic processing systems 
until relatively recently  in order to minimize the length of data fields  most date sensitive programs eliminated the first two digits of the year 
this issue could affect information technology it systems and date sensitive embedded technology that controls certain systems such as telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
leaving them unable to properly recognize or distinguish dates in the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
this treatment could result in significant miscalculations when processing critical date sensitive information relating to dates after december  the general partner is currently in the process of assessing and testing year compliance of its it systems  which include software systems to administer and manage mortgage assets and software systems used for internal accounting purposes 
a majority of the it systems used by the partnership is licensed from third parties 
these third parties have either provided upgrades to existing systems or have indicated that their systems are year compliant 
the general partner has applied upgrades and has completed a substantial amount of compliance testing as of march  there can be no assurance  however  that the partnership s it systems will be year compliant by december  the year issue may also affect the general partner s date sensitive embedded technology  which controls systems such as the telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
the general partner does not part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations believe that the cost to modify or replace such technology to make it year compliant will be material 
the failure of any such systems to be year compliant could be material to the partnership 
the potential impact of the year issue depends not only on the corrective measures the general partner has undertaken and will undertake  but also on the ways in which the year issue is addressed by third parties with whom the partnership directly interfaces or whose financial condition or operations are important to the partnership 
the partnership has initiated communications with third parties with which it directly interfaces to evaluate the risk of their failure to be year compliant and the extent to which the partnership may be vulnerable to such failure 
there can be no assurance that the systems of these third parties will be year compliant by december  the failure of these third parties to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the partnership 
the partnership believes that its greatest risk with respect to the year issue relates to failures by third parties to be year compliant 
in addition to risks posed by third parties with which the partnership interfaces directly  risks are created by third parties providing services to large segments of society 
the failure of third parties to be year compliant could  among other things  cause disruptions in the capital and real estate markets and borrower defaults on real estate loans and mortgage backed securities as well as the pools of mortgage loans underlying such securities 
the partnership believes that its greatest exposure to the year issue involves the loan servicing operations of an affiliate of the partnership 
an affiliate of the partnership  cmslp  currently services approximately of the total mortgage investments in the aim funds 
cmslp has applied a vendor upgrade and has substantially completed compliance testing on the upgrade 
currently the partnership estimates the cost of system upgrades related to year issues to be immaterial 
although the general partner has substantially completed its compliance testing and remediation  it is also in the process of developing contingency plans for the risks of the failure of the partnership or third parties to be year compliant 
the general partner intends to complete contingency plans for the year issue by may  due to the inability to predict all of the potential problems that may arise from the year issue  there can be no assurance that all contingencies will be adequately addressed by such plans
