item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors 
overview cvt is an early stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the application of molecular cardiology to the discovery  development and commercialization of novel small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
since its inception in december  substantially all of the company s resources have been dedicated to research and development 
to date  cvt has not generated any product revenue and does not expect to generate any such revenues for at least several years 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company expects its sources of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under corporate partnerships and interest income 
the process of developing the company s products will require significant additional research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approval 
these activities  together with the company s general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future 
the company will not receive product revenue unless it or its collaborative partners complete clinical trials and successfully commercialize one or more of its products 
cvt is subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in its research and development efforts and clinical trials  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approval 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for cvt and  in some cases  its collaborators  to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the company s product candidates  obtain regulatory clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
the company recognized collaborative research revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million during year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of million of deferred revenue being recognized during  in conjunction with the company s completion of the research component of its collaboration with biogen  inc research and development expenses 
the company s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase during was primarily due to increased outside service expenses associated with ranolazine clinical trials 
the company expects research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as the company expands research and product development efforts 
the company has taken  and is continuing to take  extra measures to stimulate faster enrollment in its ongoing phase iii monotherapy clinical trial of ranolazine due to slower than originally projected enrollment 
these measures resulted in an increase in enrollment in the second half of  and are expected to result in further enrollment increases  and hence an increase in clinical trial expenses 
two other phase iii clinical trials with ranolazine are expected to begin in  which will likely result in a further increase in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses will also increase due to activities associated with cvt  which entered a phase i clinical trial in september general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   which were the same as for the year ended december  the company expects general and administrative expenses to increase in the future in support of the company s research and development activities 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net increased to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in was due to higher average investment balances as a result of net proceeds of million from the company s follow on public offering of  shares of common stock that was completed in january the increase was partially offset by a  charge for the early retirement of a capital lease obligation 
the company expects that interest and other income  net will fluctuate with average investment balances 
taxes 
the company has not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately million 
because the company has experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce the company s federal income tax liabilities

research and development expenses 
the company s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the higher expenses in were primarily due to increased activity associated with the development of ranolazine as well as a million milestone payment to syntex payable under the original license agreement for ranolazine and the issuance of shares of the company s common stock to syntex valued at  under an amendment to the license agreement 
these expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the use of outside contract services by the company 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the amortization of deferred compensation expense  personnel recruiting expenses and new administrative expenses associated with becoming a public company 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in was a result of higher average investment balances resulting from the proceeds of the company s initial public offering completed in november  payments received in connection with the company s collaboration and license agreements with biogen entered into in march and proceeds from the private placement of shares of common stock with biotech target sa  an affiliate of bb biotech ag of switzerland bb biotech  in october in contrast  during the year ended december   the company had lower average investment balances and incurred prepayment penalties associated with a restructuring of the company s debt 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations since inception primarily through private placements of preferred and common stock  public offerings of common stock  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments under corporate collaborations 
in november  the company completed an initial public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million 
on march   the company entered into two research collaboration and license agreements with biogen that together resulted in cash receipts of million 
in addition  biogen agreed to make development milestones and equity investments and provide funding under a general purpose loan facility  all of which are subject to achievement of certain clinical development and commercialization milestones 
biogen will also pay royalties from any future product sales 
on october   the company raised net proceeds of million in a private placement of equity securities with bb biotech 
in january  the company completed a follow on public offering of  shares of the company s common stock and raised net proceeds of approximately million

net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the difference in cash used in operating activities in as compared to was primarily the result of the million up front payment received in under the collaboration with biogen  inc and which was treated as deferred revenue as of december  the remaining increase of million was primarily due to increased research and development efforts 
as of december   the company had invested million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through equipment and leasehold financings at various times 
the company will require substantial additional funding in order to complete its research and development activities and commercialize any potential products 
the company currently estimates that its existing resources and projected interest income will enable the company to maintain its current and planned operations through the first half of however  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding prior to such time or that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the company s forecast of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including those described in risk factors cvt must secure additional financing to meet its future needs and elsewhere in this report 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in its research and development programs  the size and complexity of such programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the ability of the company to establish and maintain corporate partnerships  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical material and other factors not within the company s control 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing to meet the company s capital requirements will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
insufficient funds may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than the company would otherwise choose or may adversely affect the company s ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
year many computer systems  applications  information technologies and equipment containing computer related components generally computer systems and equipment are unable to differentiate between the year and the year because they were programmed with two digit  rather than four digit  date fields 
accordingly  older computer systems that have time sensitive applications may not properly recognize the year and beyond year issue 
this could cause system or equipment shut downs  failures or miscalculations resulting in inaccuracies in computer output or disruptions of operations  including  among other things  inaccurate processing of financial information and or temporary inabilities to process transactions  manufacture products  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has formed a committee to assess the impact of the problem on the company s operations  however  the committee s assessment of the year issue is not yet complete 
the company has tested its key computer systems and equipment including financial  informational and operational systems and determined that these systems are largely year compliant 
the company expects to complete upgrades to its systems which are not year compliant by the end of the company believes that with these upgrades  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems and equipment 
however  if such upgrades are not made or are not completed in a timely fashion  the year issue might have an adverse impact on the operations of the company  the precise degree of which cannot be known at this time 
the company currently has no contingency plans to deal with major year failures 
in addition to risks associated with the company s own computer systems and equipment  the company has relationships with  and is to varying degrees dependent upon  a large number of third parties that provide information  goods and services to the company 
these include financial institutions  suppliers  vendors  research partners and governmental entities 
if significant numbers of these third parties experience failures in their computer systems  or equipment due to the year issue  these failures could affect the company s ability to process transactions  manufacture products  or engage in similar normal business activities 
while some of these risks are outside of the company s control  the company has instituted programs  including internal records review and use of external questionnaires  to identify key third parties  assess their level of year compliance  update contracts and address any non compliance issues 
the total cost of the year systems assessment and upgrades is funded through operating cash flows and the company is expensing these costs 
the company has created a mechanism to trace certain of the costs related to the year issue and budgeted funds to address the issues of assessment conversion 
the financial impact of making the required systems changes cannot be known precisely at this time  but it is currently expected to be less than  the actual financial impact could  however  exceed this estimate 
these costs are not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
