the company regularly evaluates properties for possible acquisition or disposition 
individual properties may be acquired through direct purchase of the property or through the purchase of the entity owning such property and may be made for cash or securities of the company or the operating partnership 
in connection with any acquisition  the company may incur additional indebtedness 
if the company acquires or disposes of any property  such acquisition or disposition could have a significant effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
year in the course of the company s planned upgrade of its information systems to accommodate growth of its business  the company will assure that its computer software and hardware will be year compliant 
to date  the company anticipates that the upgrade of its information systems will be completed during and believes that the cost thereof is not material and will not have a material impact on net income  assets or liabilities 
the company has incurred specifically related to year compliance and anticipates  of future related costs 
the company the company has begun to identify the other non information systems that depend on microprocessors in the conduct of its business 
because of the nature of the company s business  it does not depend to any material extent on electronic interchange of data or information with its residents  suppliers or vendors 
the following table outlines the company s status to date of risks associated with the year problem assessment remediation testing implementation information complete complete complete complete technology expected expected expected completion date  completion date  completion date  october october october operating equipment with complete complete complete complete embedded chips or software expected expected expected completion date  completion date  completion date  september september september rd party expected complete complete complete completion date for surveying all third parties  june although the company believes that there will be no direct material effects on its net income  assets or liabilities from the year problem as it relates to the above stated systems  it is not possible to quantify any potential indirect effects that may result from the lack of year readiness on the part of other third parties with whom the company conducts its business 
widespread disruptions in the national or international economy  including disruptions affecting the financial markets  resulting from year issues  could also have an adverse impact on the company 
the likelihood and effect of such disruptions to residential  subsidized residential  and retail properties is not determinable at this time 
the company s fallback position  if a disruption does occur  is to rebuild its information systems from contemporaneous manual monthly records maintained at the company s main office 
property sites consist mainly of single story and low rise buildings with very little reliance on microprocessors imbedded in systems that are part of property operating systems 
any possible disruption can be avoided by manually operating these property systems 
funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined as income before gains losses on investments and extraordinary items computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles plus real estate depreciation  less preferred dividends and after adjustment for significant non recurring items  if any 
this definition conforms to the recommendations set forth in a white paper adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in early ffo for years prior to have been adjusted to conform to the nareit definition 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with the net income as presented in the financial statements and information included elsewhere in this report 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ffo increased  from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
dividends declared for the year ended december  were  representing of ffo  while dividends declared for the year ended december  were  representing of ffo 
ffo increased  from  in to  in dividends declared for the year ended december  were  representing of ffo 
dividends declared for the year ended december  were  representing of ffo 
ffo was calculated as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands income before extraordinary expenses and minority interests   real estate depreciation and amortization   non recurring expenses  funds from operations before extraordinary   expenses and minority interests minority interests in consolidated partnerships ffo   seasonality historically  net income from the properties has been lower in the first and second quarters than in the remainder of the year due to higher utility charges  snow removal and other weather related expenses 
in addition  rental rates increase ratably during the year which results in higher rental revenues in the second half of the year 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the apartment communities are for a term of one year or less  which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or rerenting 
such short term leases generally lessen the risk to the company of the potential adverse effects of inflation 
safe harbor statement under private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in this report  and in particular in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  statements in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and statements in other public documents of the company may be forward looking and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements generally contain words like believes  expects  anticipates or words of similar import 
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  i population shifts which may increase or decrease the demand for rental housing  ii the ability of the company effectively to integrate recently acquired properties into its operations and to adapt its operations to the ownership of subsidized housing  iii the value of commercial and residential rental properties in the northeast where all of the company s properties are located  in recent years  have fluctuated considerably  iv the effect on the company s properties of competition from new apartment complexes which may be completed in proximity to such properties thereby increasing competition  v the effect of weather and other conditions which can significantly affect property operating expenses  vi the availability of acquisition financing or refinancing  vii compliance with applicable laws and regulations  including the regulations of hud and mhfa  and viii other factors which might be described from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  the company is subject to the effects of changes in the general business economic conditions 
although the company believes that its properties will continue to be attractive to tenants and that it will be able to control expenses  future revenue and operating trends cannot be reliably predicted 
these trends may cause the company to adjust its operation in the future 
factors external to the company can also affect the price of the company s common shares 
because of the foregoing and other factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future financial results or stock prices 
item a 
market risk and risk management policies the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its credit facility 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move decrease in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the net fair value of all interest sensitive financial instruments by  at december
