item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations we maintain our records on a fiscal year ending on september of each year and all references to a year refer to the fiscal year ending on that date 
overview we were incorporated in january to design  develop  manufacture and market a broad range of electronic components based on saw technology for use in telecommunications  data communications  video transmission  military and space systems and other applications 
our focus has been on the high end performance spectrum of the market  and our primary products are saw bandpass filters  resonators  delay lines  oscillators  saw based subsystems and chemical sensors 
our products were initially concentrated in the military and space systems market  with over half of net sales in attributable to this market segment 
since then  we made a strategic decision to target commercial markets  which accounted for approximately of net sales in and of net sales in we have witnessed significant growth in our international markets over the last five years 
international sales accounted for of net sales in we derive revenue from high volume commercial production components  military industrial production components and engineering services and products 
non recurring engineering revenue is included in engineering services and products and relates to the design and development of custom devices and delivery of one or more prototype units 
in all cases  revenue is recognized when the parts or services have been completed and units  including prototypes  have been shipped 
net sales increased from to  and from to the growth in net sales is attributable to growth in the wireless communications market to which we supply saw bandpass filters for cellular and pcs telephone base stations and handheld subscriber telephones 
we have a broad product line of saw filters  components  and subsystems with average selling prices ranging from under for rf filters to over  for complex sub systems 
for  net sales to our top customers accounted for approximately of net sales  compared to in  with the top five customers accounting for approximately of net sales in  compared to in we expect that sales of products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of certain items from our statements of income to net sales percentage of net sales year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses selling expenses gen 
adm 
expenses r d expenses total operating expenses operating income other income net income before income taxes income taxes net income comparison of years ended september  and net sales 
net sales increased from million in to million in the increase was due to an increase in shipments of bandpass filters for cdma handsets  which increased from of net sales in to of net sales in sales of filters for base station applications decreased from due to lower average selling prices 
sales for military and space applications also declined from of sales in to of sales in international sales increased from of net sales in to of net sales in due to the recovery of the south korean market  which accounted for of net sales in compared to of net sales in sales to all other international markets also increased slightly in compared to gross margin 
the gross margin increased from of net sales in to of net sales in the increase is attributed to higher yields  reduced prices for certain raw materials  a lower labor base for much of compared to and a shift of more production to our low cost  high volume costa rican operation 
our costa rican operation accounted for of net sales in compared to of net sales in we believe that we will produce a significantly higher volume of parts in fy compared to  however  these newer parts will likely have substantially lower average selling prices compared to products sold in as a result  we believe that while revenue may increase in  our gross margin will decline as a percent of net sales because the newer parts are subject to more competitive pricing and the cost to manufacture will be higher as a percent of revenue compared to products sold in selling expenses 
selling expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales from to the decrease is due to reduced corporate sales expense and reduced commissions paid to independent sales representatives due in part to our opening of a korean sales office which reduced the cost of selling into the korean market 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales from to the decrease is due to reduced corporate administrative staff in compared to in addition  the general and administrative costs for included various costs associated with the acquisition of microsensor systems  inc and costs to transfer certain of its operations to orlando 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase is due to more r d programs undertaken  including costs associated with developing vaporlab  which is a handheld saw based chemical detector  costs associated with developing saw based rf filters and other programs 
other income 
other income increased million from to due to increased interest income on our cash and investment portfolio  which increased from million in to million in income tax expense 
the provision for income tax as a percentage of income before tax was in compared to in the slightly lower effective rate for compared to relates to increased tax exempt interest earned  the benefit from our foreign sales corporation  increased r d tax credit due to increased r d expenditures and a lower effective rate for state income taxes 
we believe that our effective tax rate will be between and for comparison of years ended september  and net sales 
net sales increased from million in to million in the increase was due to an increase in shipments of cdma subscriber handset filters which grew from of net sales in to of net sales in sales of gsm base station filters declined from million in to million in due to the conversion to smaller  lower cost  surface mount package filters in compared to larger  higher average price  dual in line package filters sold in sales of cdma base station filters were essentially unchanged from the previous year 
international sales decreased from of total sales in to of total sales in due to the economic recession in asia and reduced revenue from gsm base station filters to european customers 
sales to south korean customers decreased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in sales to south korean customers dropped in the fourth quarter of to approximately of total sales due to the economic turmoil experienced in that country and the decline in consumer and industrial spending 
sales for military and space systems decreased from million in to million in gross margin 
gross margin decreased slightly from in to in due to lower gross profit margin on filters for subscriber handsets  which increased as a percentage of overall revenue  lower gross profit margin on surface mount gsm base station filters and competitive pricing pressure 
offsetting these factors were improvements in manufacturing automation  improved yields and higher productivity per worker in compared to selling expenses 
selling expenses increased from million in to million in due to commissions paid to independent sales representatives and increased costs for the internal sales personnel and related expenses 
selling expenses decreased as a percentage of overall sales from in to in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in due to reduced corporate administrative staff in compared to  lower bonus payments and no grants of compensatory stock options in compared to research and development expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in due to additional personnel and expanded research and development efforts  particularly for the development of saw based chemical sensors 
a significant portion of our development activities are conducted in connection with the design and development of devices for specific customer applications  which are paid for by these customers and are classified as nre items 
the revenue generated from these items is included in net sales and the cost is reflected in cost of sales rather than in research and development expenses 
other income 
other income increased in due to interest earned on the higher cash and investment balances in compared to and lower interest expense 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before tax was in compared to in the slightly lower effective tax rate for relates to increased interest earned on tax exempt securities  benefit from our foreign sales corporation and a lower effective rate for state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our business through cash generated from operations  bank borrowings  lease financing  the private sale of securities  our may  initial public offering and the july  follow on public offering 
we require capital principally for equipment  financing of accounts receivable and inventory  investment in product development activities and new technologies  expansion of our operation in costa rica and orlando and potential acquisitions of new technologies or compatible companies 
for the year ended september   we generated net cash from operating activities of million  consisting primarily of net income of million  million of depreciation and amortization and an increase of million in deferred taxes  offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
we have a revolving credit agreement totaling million from suntrust bank  central florida  na available through march  there were no balances outstanding on this credit line at september  we made capital expenditures of approximately million during the year ended september  we intend to spend approximately million over the next months on capital equipment and facilities to increase capacity 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of common stock 
to date   shares have been repurchased under this program  of which  shares costing approximately million were purchased in the year ended september  we expect to continue to repurchase shares of common stock from time to time in the future 
the repurchased shares will be used to satisfy stock option exercises and issuance of shares under other stock related benefit programs 
we believe that our present cash position  together with our credit facility and funds expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and other cash requirements throughout the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital needs or to provide funding for capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that it will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
foreign operations  export sales and foreign currency we established a subsidiary in costa rica in  began operations in the second quarter and commenced shipments in the third quarter of as of september   we had a net investment in fixed assets of approximately million in this operation and recorded net sales of approximately million with an operating profit of approximately million for the functional currency for the costa rican subsidiary is the us dollar as sales  most material cost and equipment are us dollar denominated 
the effects of currency fluctuations of the local costa rican currency are not considered significant and are not hedged 
in  we established a foreign sales corporation pursuant to the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code to take advantage of income tax reductions on export sales 
for  the cost to operate this subsidiary was less than  and it has less than  in identifiable assets 
in  we opened a sales and service office in seoul  south korea to assist in our asian sales efforts 
the cost to operate this subsidiary in was less than  international sales are denominated in us dollars and represented  and of net sales for the years ended september   and  respectively 
sales to the european market accounted for  and for these same periods  respectively  and sales to the asian and pacific rim markets  principally to south korea were  and  respectively for these same periods 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
over the past year  the valuations of many foreign currencies have fluctuated relative to the us dollar 
the korean won and japanese yen  in particular  have fluctuated in value due in part to the economic events experienced by these countries over the past year 
a stronger us dollar makes it more difficult for companies in these countries to purchase us products and makes it more difficult for us to compete against saw producers based in these countries 
a weaker us dollar may make it more expensive for us to buy certain raw materials and equipment from japanese suppliers 
the new common european currency  the euro  made its debut in january approximately of our sales are to european customers 
to date  none of our customers or suppliers has requested us to transact business in the euro 
at this time  the impact of this new currency is not determinable 
recently issued accounting standards please see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new pronouncements 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on operating costs and earnings 
year compliance the year issue relates to the method used by computer systems and software for recognizing the two digit year code as the year  instead of computer hardware and software describes traditional information technology systems such as enterprise resource planning systems  accounting systems  fax servers  print servers  desktop computers and applications  telephone pbx systems  as well as other systems such as manufacturing equipment  facilities equipment and security systems and imbedded hardware 
some of our computer hardware and software may recognize a year represented by as  instead of this could result in unexpected behavior in the affected hardware or software 
these systems will need to be able to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from prior years 
as a result  systems that do not accept four digit year entries will need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such year requirements 
our state of readiness year our year inventory  assessment  remediation and testing began in january we believe that we have substantially completed the tasks for a successful year transition 
to certify year compliance  we employed two methods 
vendor certification was the primary method utilized 
in order for a system to be considered compliant from vendor certification  we required a written statement from the vendor  as well as a description of the testing methods used 
if this information was not available or was not otherwise considered adequate  we performed internal tests 
these tests include the use of a certified hardware test program  the examination of the software source code by our software engineering department or information systems department and advancing the date past january  we also surveyed key suppliers 
as of october   of those surveyed have responded 
of those surveyed  all except one are already compliant 
the sole remaining key supplier expects to be compliant by december  no suppliers responded that they would fail to be year compliant 
we have determined  through surveys of our key customers  that all of them either have achieved full year compliance or will be compliant by december  costs to address the year issues the bulk of our costs to address year issues are internal staff time estimated at less than  and the cost to upgrade our main mrp software which is certified as year compliant 
the cost of this upgrade  which was purchased in fiscal  was  the cost to complete the year compliance was funded out of fiscal and operating cash flow 
the risks of the year issues our products generally are not date sensitive and  therefore  are not subject to year defects or problems 
we believe that our primary manufacturing  engineering  financial and administrative systems are year compliant 
we believe that the greatest potential risk from year issues relates to the possibility that a major supplier or customer whose systems are not year compliant may be unable to meet delivery requirements for an important raw material or piece of equipment or may not be able to accept shipment of our products until they correct their year problem 
we believe that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected in a timely fashion  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially adversely impact our results of operations or adversely affect relationships with customers  vendors or other relevant parties 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse impact on our systems or results of operations 
our contingency plans year we have begun  but not yet completed  a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that could reasonably occur from any failure by us or third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
a contingency plan has been developed for dealing with the most likely  worst case scenario 
this worst case scenario includes difficulties in customer billing  order processing  disruptions in our receipt of raw material  loss of power and equipment malfunction 
if this worst case scenario occurred it would harm our business 
depending on the systems affected  these plans could include increased work hours for our personnel or the use of contract personnel to correct on an accelerated schedule any year problems which may arise and use of manual workarounds for information systems 
we are continuing to modify this plan and expect to have a completed plan by november  however  because of our large power requirements  it is not practical to establish emergency power systems should our electrical suppliers encounter disruption in service 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to minimal market and interest rate risk 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative investment portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative securities  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are exposed to currency exchange fluctuations since we sell our products internationally and we purchase raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers 
we are also exposed to currency fluctuations associated with our costa rican operation 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales  purchases of raw materials and equipment and our costa rican operation by denominating most transactions in us dollars 
we do engage in limited foreign currency hedging transactions  principally to lock in the cost of purchase commitments that are not denominated in us dollars 
at september   we are committed to purchase  dutch guilders approximately million under forward foreign currency contracts for the purchase of equipment 
we are exposed to minimal interest rate risk on debt instruments as our outstanding debt is less than million  and we do not plan to use additional debt based financing to fund capital expenditures over the next months
