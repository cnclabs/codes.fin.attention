results of operations 
the major elements of the consolidated statement of income are discussed below 
operating revenues and megawatt hour mwh sales a summary of mwh sales and operating revenues for  and is set forth below mwh sales revenues s residential       commercial       industrial       other retail       total retail sales       resale sales firm    entitlement       other       total resale sales       other revenues    total       year to year fluctuations in total retail mwh sales are primarily affected by customer growth  conservation and load management c lm programs  as well as relative prices of alternate energy sources  weather patterns and conservation induced by price changes and income elasticity responses of customers 
compared to  retail mwh sales for decreased  mwh and related revenues decreased million  or 
compared to the revenue decrease is primarily attributable to a modified rate design reflected in bills rendered since april  the modified rate design  which is revenue neutral on an annual basis  decreases prices charged during the winter months of december through march and increases prices during the remaining months of the year 
retail mwh sales for increased compared to reflecting an improved vermont economy 
however  retail revenues increased million or over due to a million increase in revenues resulting from the full year impact of a retail rate increase effective june   retail rate increase effective january   the positive impact of the modified rate design described above  and a increase in retail mwh sales 
for  entitlement mwh sales decreased compared to the decrease results primarily from the scheduled refueling and maintenance outage of the vermont yankee plant 
the outage  which reduced the plant s output  also reduced mwh sales 
however  a portion of the higher costs of the company s share of vermont yankee s costs associated with the refueling and maintenance outage was passed on to entitlement customers resulting in an increase in entitlement revenues of 
million  or 
entitlement mwh sales and revenues decreased for compared to primarily due to the scheduled termination of several sales agreements in late other resale sales increased  mwh and related revenues increased million for the increase resulted primarily from short term system capacity sales between the company and virginia power which jointly supply wholesale power in new england 
this increase is partially offset by lower sales to nepool 
other resale sales and revenues for increased and  respectively  due to increased sales to new england power pool nepool partially offset by a decrease in wholly owned and jointly owned units sales 
other revenues decreased for due to a provision for rate refunds of million related to a fuel adjustment clause fac and purchased power cost adjustment ppca associated with the december  court of appeals decision discussed below  and to lower revenues associated with transmission interconnection agreements partially offset by increased pole attachment rentals 
the increases in other revenues for resulted primarily from an increase in transmission revenues related to various transmission interconnection agreements

over of its purchases are from affiliated companies whereby the company receives its entitlement share of the output 
the company s purchased power portfolio assures that a diversified mix of sources and fuel types are available to meet the company s long term load growth while providing short and intermediate term opportunities to purchase or sell capacity and energy to reduce overall power costs

the vermont yankee nuclear power plant  which provides approximately one third of the company s power supply  began a refueling outage on march  and returned to service on june  the refueling outage extended twenty six days beyond the scheduled forty nine days 
vermont yankee had no scheduled refueling outage in and had a scheduled refueling outage from september through november  the design basis documentation project project initiated by vermont yankee during is expected to be complete by the end of year the company s share of the total cost for this project is expected to be about million 
such costs will be deferred by vermont yankee and amortized over the remaining license life of the plant 
during scheduled nuclear refueling outages  the company purchases more costly replacement energy from other sources to satisfy energy needs 
in accordance with current rate making treatment  the company defers and amortizes to expense over their respective fuel cycles the incremental replacement energy and maintenance costs associated with refueling outages for the vermont yankee nuclear power plant and unit jointly owned nuclear generating unit

until its termination on april   the company purchased power and energy from merrimack unit pursuant to a contract dated july  entered into by and between vermont electric power company  inc velco and public service company of new hampshire psnh 
pursuant to the contract  as amended  velco agreed to reimburse psnh  in the proportion which the velco quota bears to the demonstrated net capability of the plant  for all fixed costs of the unit and operating costs of the unit incurred by psnh  which are reasonable and cost effective for the remaining term of the velco contract 
in early  psnh took the merrimack unit facility off line  shut it down and commenced a maintenance outage 
in february  march and april of  psnh billed velco for costs to complete the maintenance outage 
velco disputes the validity of a portion of the charges on grounds that the maintenance performed at the unit was to extend the life of the merrimack plant beyond the term of the velco contract and that the charges in connection with said investments were not reasonable and cost effective for the remaining term of the velco contract 
the company estimates that the portion of the disputed charges allocable to the company could be as much as million on a pre tax basis 
the company  under long term contracts  purchases power from a number of small power producers who own qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of these qualifying facilities produce energy using hydroelectric  wood  biomass and refuse burning generation 
during  the company purchased  mwh of which  mwh is associated with the vermont electric power producers and  mwh with a new hampshire vermont solid waste plant 
the company expects to purchase approximately  mwh of small power output in each year through based on the forecast level of production  the total commitment in the next five years to purchase power from these qualifying facilities is estimated to be million 
the company engages in purchases and sales with other electric utilities and with nepool to take advantage of immediate pricing and other market conditions 
the company also engages in marketing activities with virginia power which jointly supply wholesale power in new england 
these purchases are included in other sources in the table above

offsetting this increase is the impact at connecticut valley totaling million associated with the reversal of a million charge off during and charge off during of million 
see electric utility restructuring new hampshire discussed below and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the increase in purchased capacity cost of million for over resulted from million in higher prices  
million increase in the amount of mw purchased and million representing connecticut valley s estimated loss on power contracts for the twelve months following december  discussed below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to a psb accounting order  during the first half of  the company reduced capacity costs by million related to the hydro quebec agreement for which a payment of million was received from hydro quebec on june  energy costs are directly related to the variable prices of oil  nuclear fuel and coal but  more importantly  to the proportion of the company s purchased energy that comes from each of these fuel sources 
the increase in energy costs for resulted from a or  million increase in cost per mwh purchased and a 
million increase in the amount of mwh purchased 
the price increase results primarily from the higher costs under the hydro quebec power contract  increased purchases from small power producers and the vermont yankee extended outage 
the increase in energy costs for resulted from a or million increase in cost per mwh purchased and a  or 
million increase in the amount of mwh purchased 
the price increase results primarily from incremental replacement power costs associated with unit discussed above 
for information related to recovery of costs associated with the premature retirement of the maine yankee and connecticut yankee nuclear power plants see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is responsible for paying its entitlement percentage of decommissioning costs for vermont yankee  connecticut yankee  maine yankee and yankee atomic as well as its joint ownership percentage of decommissioning costs for unit see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the staff of the securities and exchange commission has questioned certain current accounting practices of the electric utility industry  including the company  regarding the recognition  measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in financial statements of electric utilities 
in response to these questions  the financial accounting standards board has agreed to review the industry wide accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs 
if current electric utility industry accounting practices for such decommissioning costs are changed  it is possible that annual expense provisions for decommissioning costs could increase  the total estimated costs for decommissioning could be recorded as a liability  and income from external decommissioning trusts could be reported as investment income instead of a reduction to decommissioning expense 
the company does not believe that such changes  if required  would have an adverse effect on results of operations due to its ability to recover decommissioning costs through the regulatory process

millstone unit resumed operation in june  accordingly  production fuel costs increased for compared to also  due to increased generation at the wyman and the joseph c 
mcneil generating stations  production fuel costs increased for compared to in order to optimize its power mix for baseload  intermediate and peaking power  the company engages in purchases and sales with other electric utilities  primarily in new england and with nepool 
the profits from these transactions are used to reduce purchased power costs 
the company also engages in marketing activities with virginia power which jointly supply wholesale power in new england 
based on present commitments and contracts  the company expects that net purchased power and production fuel costs will be approximately million  million and million for the period through production and transmission due to increased production costs  primarily related to unit and higher transmission costs  production and transmission expenses increased million in compared to other operation expenses primarily due to increased legal and regulatory expenses  other operation expenses increased million for compared to other operation expenses  in  increased million compared to resulting primarily from increased amortization of conservation and load management costs combined with a decrease in deferral of conservation and load management costs 
maintenance expenses maintenance expenses associated with the company s joint ownership interest in unit decreased for compared to however  this decrease was offset by an increase in maintenance expenses associated with the company s tree trimming program and expenses attributable to the severe ice storm in january the increase in maintenance expenses for compared to is due to increased unit maintenance costs

also  other income  net for and include million and 
million of expenses incurred in connection with the gauley river power project  currently under construction  in summersville  west virginia 
other interest expense other interest expense increased for due to an increase in outstanding short term debt offset somewhat by lower interest rates 
other interest expense declined for due to a decrease in short term debt levels

the level of short term borrowings fluctuates based on seasonal corporate needs  the timing of long term financings and market conditions 
the company has a million revolving credit facility with a group of banks maturing june  of which million was outstanding at december  the company expects that borrowings will be million by june  the company must rollover an aggregate of million of letters of credit between december and may in addition  the company has a million accounts receivable facility which matures in november the company s ability to extend or replace the maturing million revolving credit facility  roll over million of maturing letters of credit and extend the accounts receivable facility will be dependent in large part on a positive outcome of the pending hydro quebec contract issues at the vsc or progress made in power contract renegotiations 
negotiations are ongoing with the banks to extend the maturities of these financial arrangements 
connecticut valley has outstanding long term bank debt of million maturing december  in regard to connecticut valley s long term debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
also see electric industry restructuring new hampshire for additional discussion of certain events which may lead to an acceleration of the repayment date of this loan 
if the company is unable to extend the maturities of or replace the bulk of the debt and letters of credit facilities referenced above  it would jeopardize the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in extending or replacing these credit facilities 
on june   the company s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate from

in addition  the ratings were also placed on credit watch with negative implications 
standard poor s stated the creditwatch listing reflects the potentially adverse impact of pending legal and regulatory decisions that could seriously weaken the company s credit profile 
the downgrades reflect increased business risk and weakened financial measures as a result of recent regulatory decisions in vermont and new hampshire and an adverse ruling by the united states first circuit court of appeals 
standard poor s also said resolution of the creditwatch listing will depend on the outcome of the pending federal energy regulatory commission case and other legal proceedings at state and federal levels  which could be resolved in adequate rate relief and successful mitigation of high power costs through contract renegotiations or other methods are essential to stabilizing the ratings 
on february   duff phelps credit rating co 
duff phelps placed the credit ratings of the company on rating watch down due to the high level of regulatory and public policy uncertainty in vermont and the recent unfavorable ruling by the united states court of appeals relating to connecticut valley  the company s wholly owned new hampshire subsidiary 
duff phelps stated recent negative rulings by the psb regarding purchased power costs and the high level of uncertainty with public policy toward electric utilities in vermont adds risk to the company s financial profile going forward 
current credit ratings by duff phelps remain at bbb triple b for first mortgage bonds and bbb triple b minus for preferred stock 
the company s declining credit ratings as well as continuing uncertainty raise significant doubt regarding the company s ability to extend or replace maturing debt and letters of credit arrangements 
current credit ratings of the company s securities by duff phelps and standard poor s are as follows duff standard phelps poor s corporate credit rating bbb first mortgage bonds bbb bbb preferred stock bbb bb on november   catamount  a wholly owned non utility subsidiary of the company  replaced its million credit facility with a million revolving credit facility expiring november  which provides for up to million in revolving credit loans and letters of credit

hydro quebec contract the company is a party to a power contract with hydro quebec through the vermont joint owners vjo  a consortium of vermont utilities which includes the company  green mountain power corporation gmp  citizen s utilities  rochester electric light power and vermont public power supply authority representing municipalities and a cooperative in vermont 
under these agreements  there are step up provisions that provide that in the event any vjo member fails to meet its obligation under the contract with hydro quebec  the balance of the vjo participants  including the company  will step up to the defaulting party s share on a pro rata basis 
as of december  the company s vjo obligation is approximately or billion on a nominal basis over the term of the contract ending in the total vjo contract obligation on a nominal basis over the term of the contact is approximately billion 
during january  a significant ice storm affected parts of new york  new england and the province of quebec  canada 
this storm damaged major components of the hydro quebec transmission system over which power is supplied to vermont under the vjo contract with hydro quebec 
this resulted in an interruption of a significant portion of scheduled contractual power deliveries into vermont 
the ice storm s effect on hydro quebec s transmission system caused the vjo to examine hydro quebec s overall reliability and ability to deliver energy in the future 
that review has prompted the vjo to initiate an arbitration proceeding  the end result of which may be the termination of the contract 
by way of the arbitration  the vjo is also seeking to recover capacity payments made during the period of non delivery 
diversification catamount was formed for the purpose of investing in non regulated power plant projects 
currently  catamount  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  has interests in five operating independent power projects located in glenns ferry and rupert  idaho  rumford  maine  east ryegate  vermont  and hopewell  virginia 
in addition  catamount has interests in projects under construction in thetford  england  and in summersville  west virginia  and under development in fort dunlop  england 
catamount s after tax earnings were million  million and 
million for  and  respectively 
earnings for include a net of tax gain of million from the sale of nw energy williams lake lp also  results of operation for and include 
million and million of pre tax expenses related to the gauley river project currently under construction in summersville  west virginia 
smartenergy was formed to engage in the sale of or rental of electric water heaters  energy efficient products and other related goods and services 
smartenergy incurred losses of million and 
million for and  respectively  and earnings of 
million for rates and regulation the company recognizes that adequate and timely rate relief is necessary if the company is to maintain its financial strength  particularly since vermont regulatory rules do not allow for changes in purchased power and fuel costs to be passed on to consumers through automatic rate adjustment clauses 
the company s practice of reviewing costs periodically will continue and rate increases will be requested when warranted 
retail rate case on june   the company filed with the psb for a retail rate increase to be effective march  this rate case proceeding overlapped the rate increase request referenced below that is now stayed pending a review on the so called preclusion issue by the vsc 
on october   the company reached an agreement with the dps regarding the rate increase request 
the agreement  which was approved by the psb on december   provides for a temporary rate increase in the company s vermont retail rates of or million on an annualized basis beginning with service rendered january  and sets the company s authorized return on equity in its vermont retail business at before disallowances in connection with the hydro quebec contract 
the rate increase is temporary insofar as it is subject to adjustment upon future resolution of the hydro quebec contract issues presently before the vsc 
the company anticipates a resolution of the hydro quebec issues before the vsc by the end of the agreement incorporates a disallowance of approximately million for the company s purchased power costs under the hydro quebec contract while the vsc reviews the psb denial of the company s claim that the psb is precluded from again trying the company on certain hydro quebec contract issues 
upon approval of the agreement by the psb  the company  during the fourth quarter of  recorded a loss of million on a pre tax basis for disallowed purchased power costs  representing the company s estimated under recovery of power costs under the hydro quebec contract 
this million disallowance was calculated using the same formula as contained in the rate order issued by the psb in the green mountain power corporation gmp rate case on february  see additional information below 
if the company receives an unfavorable ruling from the vsc  and the psb issues a rate order adopting the methodology used to determine the temporary hydro quebec disallowance for the duration of the hydro quebec contract  approximately million of power costs to be incurred under that contract would not be recoverable in rates 
this would result in an immediate charge to earnings of million once such outcome became probable 
such an outcome would jeopardize the ability of the company to continue as a going concern 
retail rate case on september   the company filed for a or million general rate increase to become effective june  to offset the increasing cost of providing service 
million or of the rate increase request was to recover contractual increases in the cost of power the company purchases from hydro quebec 
at the same time  the company also filed a request to eliminate the winter summer rate differential and price electricity the same year round 
the change would be revenue neutral within classes of customers and overall 
over time  customers would see a leveling off of rates so they would pay the same per kilowatt hour during the winter and summer months 
the psb decided to appoint an independent investigator to examine the company s decision to buy power from hydro quebec 
the company filed a motion with the psb stating that the psb already examined the company s decision to buy power from hydro quebec and  therefore  the psb as well as other parties should be barred from reviewing its past decision on hydro quebec 
however  the company does not object to the independent investigator or others looking at issues of management of the power supply since the company s last rate case 
during february  the dps filed testimony in opposition to the company s or million retail rate increase request 
as a result of its testimony  the dps recommended that the psb instead reduce the company s current retail rates by or million 
on february  the psb issued an order in a gmp rate case 
that order found gmp s decision to lock in the hydro quebec vjo contract in imprudent and further found that the contract was not used and useful 
as such  the psb concluded that a large portion of the contract s current costs should not be imposed on consumers and were disallowed 
gmp appealed this rate order to the vsc 
the company is one of the participants in the vjo contract 
if the company were to receive an order similar to that obtained by gmp  such an order could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation and financial condition 
if the company were to eventually receive a rate order that would result in disallowance of hydro quebec power costs on a permanent basis similar to that contained in the gmp february  rate order  the company s ability to continue as a going concern would be jeopardized 
because of these risks and because the psb rejected the company s claim that the psb was precluded from again trying the company on certain hydro quebec and related demand side management issues 
retail rate case the company filed for a or million general rate increase on october  to become effective july  on february   the company reached an agreement with the dps regarding this rate increase request 
on april   the company received a rate order from the psb generally approving the agreement 
connecticut valley on november   connecticut valley filed with the nhpuc its annual fac ppca rates to be effective january  on january   the nhpuc issued an order allowing connecticut valley to increase the proposed fac rate of 
per kwh and the proposed ppca rate of 
per kwh rate on a temporary basis  effective on all bills rendered on or after january  in addition  the nhpuc ordered connecticut valley to pay refunds plus interest to its retail customers for any overcharges collected as a result of the april  federal district court order  should it be overturned or modified 
see electric industry restructuring new hampshire for additional information related to the court order 
on november   connecticut valley filed a request with the nhpuc to increase the fac ppca and short term energy purchase rates effective on or after january  the requested increase in rates resulted from higher forecast energy and capacity charges on power connecticut valley purchases from the company plus removal of credit effective during to refund overcollections from in an order dated december  in connecticut valley s fac and ppca docket  the nhpuc found connecticut valley acted imprudently by not terminating the wholesale contract between connecticut valley and the company  notwithstanding the stays of its february  orders 
the nhpuc order further directed connecticut valley to freeze its current fac and ppca rates other than short term rates to be paid to certain qualifying facilities effective january   on a temporary basis  pending a hearing to determine the appropriate proxy for a market price that connecticut valley could have obtained if it had terminated its wholesale contract with the company  the implications of allowing connecticut valley to pass on to its customers only that market price  and whether the nhpuc s final determination on the fac and ppca rates should be reconciled back to january  or some other date 
see electric industry restructuring discussed below and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on july   connecticut valley filed with the nhpuc for an or million base rate increase to become effective september  the increase was to recover increased operating costs and costs of improvements to the electric system 
as part of the permanent rate increase  connecticut valley also requested a temporary rate increase of or 
million 
the nhpuc granted connecticut valley a temporary rate increase of effective with bills rendered october  on january   connecticut valley and the nhpuc staff reached a settlement in principle regarding the permanent rate increase 
the settlement  approved by the nhpuc  provided for a permanent rate increase and sets connecticut valley s allowed return on common equity at 
recoupment revenues for the period october  and march   and rate case expenses were recovered through a temporary billing surcharge of approximately of total bill effective during the period april through november   when off peak rates were in effect 
as approved by the nhpuc  this billing surcharge resumed on march  to recover expenses incurred in connection with the pilot program 
management audit on april   the psb ordered an independent forward looking analysis of three of the company s management policies and practices focusing on three areas transmission of information to the company s board of directors by management  cost benefit analyses for major corporate decisions  and implementation of the company s ethics and conflict of interest policy 
the psb s consultant began work on the project during the first quarter of and issued a final report during october although the final report suggested areas where the company could improve  it was generally very positive of the company and as a result the psb has terminated the proceeding 
proposed formation of holding company in order to further prepare central vermont public service corporation for deregulation  on july   the company filed a petition with the psb for permission to create a holding company that would have as subsidiaries the company and non utility subsidiaries  catamount and smartenergy 
the company believes that a holding company structure will facilitate the company s transition to a deregulated electricity market 
the proposed holding company formation must also be approved by federal regulators  including the securities and exchange commission and the ferc  and by the company s shareholders 
year information systems modifications the company s information systems could be affected by the date change in year because most software application and operational programs will not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
in order to meet current and future business needs the company retained outside consultants to make its customer service applications year compliant 
in addition  the company utilized both internal and external resources to make other applications  including its desk top applications  year ready 
inventory and assessment activities are complete 
overall remediation efforts are estimated to be at approximately complete by the end of the first quarter of the company expects to achieve compliance with year requirements for all of its financial and operating systems by the end of the second quarter of the company s operations would be adversely affected if a date related system failure occurred with one of its major power suppliers  such as hydro quebec or vermont yankee  or velco  the company responsible for transmission in vermont 
velco indicates it will be compliant by september other delivery systems outside the state could  in the event of a date related system failure  cause additional power supply interruptions 
the company has requested written reports from its power supply vendors regarding each company s status relative to year compliance and based on responses to date  these power supply vendors have indicated that they are either currently compliant or expect to be compliant by june the company has also requested compliance information from other major vendors and suppliers 
while this process is not yet complete  based upon responses to date  many of those major vendors and suppliers have indicated that they will be year compliant in a timely manner 
however  there can be no guarantee that third parties noncompliance and their failure to remediate year issues would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
failure on the part of the company to comply by december  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
also  failures of the company s principal power and transmission suppliers to remedy year compliance issues  could have a material adverse effect on the company should non compliance result interruptions of power supply and transmission 
the company is part of the northeast grid contingency plan that would go into effect immediately which would provide electricity to its customers on a priority basis in the event of power outages 
the company also has contingency plans developed in the event of the failure of its transmission  generation  distribution  metering  telecommunications  information and public communications systems 
the company believes it will incur approximately million of costs associated with making the necessary modifications to its centralized and non centralized computer systems 
as of december   approximately million of those costs have been incurred 
during the first quarter of  the company requested an accounting order from the psb to defer these operating and maintenance costs 
on august   the psb issued an accounting order authorizing the company to defer these costs and amortize them over a five year period beginning january  per psb order dated december   the company is authorized to recover these costs through the regulatory process 
electric industry restructuring the electric utility industry is in a period of transition that may result in a shift away from ratemaking based on cost of service and return on equity to more market based rates 
many states  including vermont and new hampshire  where the company does business  are exploring new mechanisms to bring greater competition  customer choice and market influence to the industry while retaining the public benefits associated with the current regulatory system 
vermont on december   the psb issued a report and order the report outlining a restructuring plan the plan  subject to legislative approval  for the vermont electric utility industry 
due to uncertainty surrounding legislative schedules  the psb  on april   issued an order which suspended  pending further legislative action or future psb orders  certain filing deadlines for reports and plans to be completed in connection with the plan 
on april   senate bill s  an act relating to electric industry restructuring was passed by the vermont senate 
pursuant to s  electric utility customers would have been entitled to purchase electricity in a competitive market place and could have chosen their electricity supplier 
incumbent investor owned electric utilities  including the company  would have been required to separate their regulated distribution and transmission operations from the competitive generation and retail operations 
s 
provided for the recovery of a portion of investor owned utility s above market costs which became stranded on account of the introduction of competition within their service area 
when considering the recovery of such amounts  s 
would have required the psb to weigh the goal of sharing net prudently incurred  discretionary above market costs evenly between utilities and customers against other goals including preserving the continuing financial integrity of the existing utility and respecting the just interests of investors 
the company believes that the unmodified provisions of s 
would not have met the criteria for continuing application of sfas no 
s 
also created an incentive for the company to take steps to close the vermont yankee nuclear power station by conditioning the recovery of certain plant related stranded costs on the decision of its owners to cease operations in  unless the psb agreed to allow the plant to run for up to two more refuelings to avoid power shortages or for other public interest reasons 
to become law  s 
would have had to be passed by the vermont house of representatives and signed by the governor of the state of vermont 
since the legislative session concluded in april and s 
was not enacted by the vermont house of representatives and subsequently signed into law by the governor of vermont  the bill did not become law and any efforts to pursue it in the future will require that it be re enacted by the vermont senate and passed by the vermont house of representatives 
instead of considering s  the vermont house of representatives convened a special committee to study matters relating to the reform of vermont s electric utility system in the summer of that committee issued recommendations in a report and legislation was proposed that would have provided for reform but not adopt the recommendations concerning customer choice and competition set forth in the psb s report and order 
other legislation intended to advance a portion of the psb report and order was also introduced 
however  neither the house of representatives nor vermont senate acted on these reforms which must be reintroduced in the next vermont legislative biennium that began in january  if they are to be considered 
therefore  at this time  it cannot be determined whether future restructuring legislation will be enacted in that would conform to the concepts developed by the report  s 
or the house special committee report 
on july   governor dean issued an executive order establishing a working group on vermont s electricity future the working group to lead a new effort to review the issues of potential restructuring of vermont s electric industry 
the working group was created to determine how restructuring the electric industry in vermont can reduce both current and long term electric costs for all classes of vermont electric consumers 
the working group was asked to provide a fact based analysis of the options for electric industry restructuring and the impact of such industry changes on consumers and upon vermont utilities 
further  the working group was directed by governor dean to gather information on and evaluate the possible consequences of the current financial status of vermont electric utilities 
the working group was asked to complete its review and report back to governor dean and to legislative leaders by december  a report was issued by the working group on december  key conclusions of its report are vermont should restructure its electric industry by moving rapidly to retail choice whereby consumers would purchase power directly from competing power suppliers 
bankruptcy of vermont electric utilities should not be viewed as an appropriate means to reduce vermont utilities above market power supply costs 
vermont electric utilities should pursue power contract renegotiations through payments to buy down power contracts or buy out power contracts 
financing for such payments should be obtained in the capital markets after a comprehensive regulatory process dealing with all of the elements of the restructuring of the vermont electric utility industry 
the vermont electric utilities should pursue auctions of their power generation assets and remaining power contracts 
consolidation of existing electric utilities in vermont there are currently utilities should be considered in order to effect additional savings for utility customers 
the working group noted that by march   most new englanders outside vermont will have a choice of their power supplier 
while new england has the highest rates in the nation  electricity costs in vermont have been among the lowest in the region 
however  that advantage is eroding as other states in new england restructure their electric utility industries 
therefore  the working group recommends that it is in the interest of vermont ratepayers to have the benefit of a restructured electric utility industry as soon as possible 
the company has signed a confidentiality and cooperation agreement with gmp and citizens utilities to permit an exchange of information to evaluate the possibility of consolidating the vermont operations of the three utilities 
in addition  the washington electric cooperative wec has recommended that consideration be given to its acquiring vermont s investor owned utilities and converting them to a cooperative ownership structure 
the company supports the working group recommendations and will work with the psb and other parties to implement the plan 
however  there can be no assurance that the plan or its key elements  including consolidation  will ultimately be implemented 
on august   the psb hosted a workshop entitled  electricity futures reforming vermont s power supply  which was organized to facilitate power supply reform 
participants heard reports on successful power supply reforms in other states  followed by a discussion intended to identify opportunities and next steps  and to elicit proposals for reformulating vermont s electric power supply 
this workshop generated a great deal of interest with over attendees  representing vermont retail electric utilities  both large and small electricity consumers  public officials and interest groups  and several current and aspiring energy suppliers 
as a follow up to the workshop  on september   the psb opened a formal proceeding in docket no 
with the goal of creating a regulatory environment and a procedural framework to call forth  for disciplined review  proposals for reducing current and future power costs in vermont 
the psb explained that it intends that this proceeding will define one or more acceptable courses for reform  and will create the framework to enable vermont utilities and other interested parties to pursue them and to present them for regulatory approval in an open  public process 
all vermont utilities were made a party to that proceeding 
subsequent to the psb s announcement  preliminary position papers were filed and a series of technical conferences were convened with the psb to recommend the scope of the investigation  potential courses for reform of vermont s power supply and other matters associated therewith including the consideration of the working group s recommendations as well as the wec acquisition proposal 
as of this time  the psb has yet to act on any of the proposal or recommendations made concerning the disposition of the matters in docket no 
as a companion proceeding to its investigation in docket no 
 on january   the psb issued an order opening a new contested case proceeding  docket no 
a  where it intends to issue final  binding and appealable orders concerning matters related to the reform and restructuring of vermont s electric utility industry 
initially  the psb noticed parties that it intended proceedings in docket no 
a to consider matters associated with the bankruptcy of one or more of the vermont electric utilities 
after an opportunity for comment  the focus of the proceeding was amended to first consider the principles  authority and proposals for reform of vermont s electric power supply 
this will include issues associated with the scope and extent of the board s authority to approve securitization and other financings proposed to be entered into in connection with the buy out or buy down of power contracts and the criteria to be applied by the psb when considering voluntary utility restructuring proposals 
the psb explains that this proceeding will provide utilities the maximum structural guidance on the terms and conditions it will consider in a voluntary restructuring proposal 
as of this time  formal proceedings in docket no 
a are only at a preliminary status however the psb indicates that it will proceed quickly to conclude this proceeding 
new hampshire on february  the nhpuc published its detailed final plan to restructure the electric utility industry in new hampshire 
also on february   the nhpuc  in a supplemental order specific to connecticut valley  found that connecticut valley was imprudent for not terminating the ferc authorized power contract between connecticut valley and the company  required connecticut valley to give notice to cancel its contract with the company and denied stranded cost recovery related to this power contract 
connecticut valley filed for rehearing of the february  nhpuc order 
on april   the nhpuc issued an order addressing certain threshold procedural matters raised in motions for rehearing and or clarification filed by various parties  including connecticut valley  relative to the final plan and interim stranded cost orders 
the april  order stayed those aspects of the final plan that were the subject of rehearing or clarification requests and also stayed the interim stranded cost orders for the various parties  including connecticut valley 
as such  those matters pertaining to the power contract between connecticut valley and the company were stayed 
the suspension of these orders was to remain in effect until two weeks following the issuance of any order concerning outstanding requests for rehearing and clarification 
on march   the nhpuc issued an order which affirmed  clarified and modified various generic policy statements including the reaffirmation to establish rates on the basis of a regional average announced previously in its february  final plan 
the march  order also addressed all outstanding motions for rehearings or clarification relative to the policies or legal positions articulated in the final plan and removed the stay covering the company s interim stranded cost order of april  in addition  the march  order imposed various compliance filing requirements 
on november   the city of claremont  new hampshire claremont  filed with the nhpuc a petition for a reduction in connecticut valley s electric rates 
claremont based its request on the nhpuc s earlier finding that connecticut valley s failure to terminate its wholesale power contract with the company as ordered in the nhpuc stranded cost order of february  was imprudent 
claremont alleged that if connecticut valley had given written notice of termination to the company in when legislation to restructure the electric industry was enacted in new hampshire  connecticut valley s obligation to purchase power from the company would have terminated as of january  on november   connecticut valley filed a request with the nhpuc to increase the fac  ppca and short term energy purchase rates effective on or after january  the requested increase in rates resulted from higher forecast energy and capacity charges on power connecticut valley purchases from the company plus removal of a credit effective during to refund overcollections from connecticut valley objected to the nhpuc s notice of intent to consolidate claremont s petition into the fac and ppca docket  stating that claremont s complaint should be heard as part of the nhpuc restructuring docket 
over connecticut valley s objection at the hearing on december   the nhpuc consolidated claremont s petition with connecticut valley s fac and ppca proceeding 
in an order dated december  in connecticut valley s fac and ppca docket  the nhpuc found connecticut valley acted imprudently by not terminating the wholesale contract between connecticut valley and the company  notwithstanding the stays of its february  orders 
the nhpuc order further directed connecticut valley to freeze its current fac and ppca rates other than short term rates to be paid to certain qualifying facilities effective january   on a temporary basis  pending a hearing to determine the appropriate proxy for a market price that connecticut valley could have obtained if it had terminated its wholesale contract with the company  the implications of allowing connecticut valley to pass on to its customers only that market price  and whether the nhpuc s final determination on the fac and ppca rates should be reconciled back to january  or some other date 
on january   connecticut valley and the company filed with the district court of rhode island the court for a temporary restraining order to maintain the status quo ante by staying the december  nhpuc order and preventing the nhpuc from taking any action that i compromises cost based rate making for connecticut valley or otherwise seeks to impose market price based rate making on connecticut valley  ii interferes with the ferc s exclusive jurisdiction over the company s pending application to recover wholesale stranded costs upon termination of its wholesale power contract with connecticut valley  or iii prevents connecticut valley from recovering through retail rates the stranded costs and purchased power costs that it incurs pursuant to its ferc authorized wholesale rate schedule with the company 
on february   the nhpuc announced in a public meeting that it reaffirmed its finding of imprudence and designated a proxy market price for power at cents per kwh in lieu of the actual costs incurred pursuant to the wholesale power contract with the company 
in addition  the nhpuc indicated  subject to certain conditions which were unacceptable to the companies  that it would permit connecticut valley to maintain its current rates pending a decision in connecticut valley s appeal of the nhpuc order to the new hampshire supreme court 
based on the december  nhpuc order as well as the nhpuc s february  announcement  which resulted in the establishment of connecticut valley s rates on a non cost of service basis  connecticut valley no longer qualified  as of december   for the application of sfas no 
as a result  connecticut valley wrote off all of its regulatory assets associated with its new hampshire retail business as of december  this write off amounted to million on a pre tax basis 
in addition  connecticut valley recorded a million pre tax loss in for disallowed power costs 
on april   the court held a hearing on the companies motion for a temporary restraining order tro and preliminary injunction against the nhpuc at which time both the companies and the nhpuc presented arguments 
in an oral ruling from the bench  and in a written order issued on april   the court concluded that the companies had established each of the prerequisites for preliminary injunctive relief and directed and required the nhpuc to allow connecticut valley to recover through retail rates all costs for wholesale power requirements service that connecticut valley purchases from the company pursuant to its ferc authorized wholesale rate schedule effective january  until further court order 
in compliance with that order  connecticut valley received an order from the nhpuc authorizing retail rates to recover such costs beginning in may on april   the nhpuc filed a notice of appeal and a motion for a stay of the court s preliminary injunction 
the nhpuc s request for a stay was denied 
at the same time  the nhpuc permitted connecticut valley to recover in rates the full cost of its wholesale power purchases from the company 
also  on april   the court indicated that its earlier tro enjoining the nhpuc s restructuring orders applied to connecticut valley and prohibits the enforcement of the restructuring orders until the court conducts a consolidated hearing and rules on the requests for permanent injunctive relief by plaintiff psnh and the other utilities that have been allowed to intervene in these proceedings  including the company and connecticut valley 
the plaintiffs intervenors filed a motion asking the court to extend its stay of action by the nhpuc to implement restructuring and to make clear that the stay encompasses the nhpuc s order of march  as a result of these court orders  connecticut valley s charges described above were reversed in the first quarter of combined  the reversal of these charges increased first quarter net income and earnings per share of common stock by million and  respectively 
on april   citizens bank of new hampshire bank notified connecticut valley that it was in default of the loan agreement between the bank and connecticut valley dated december  and that the bank would exercise all of its remedies from and after may  in the event that the violations were not cured 
after reversing the write offs described above  connecticut valley was in compliance with the financial covenants associated with its million loan with the bank 
as a result  connecticut valley has satisfied the bank s requirements for curing the violation 
on may  the nhpuc issued an order requiring connecticut valley to show cause why it should not be held in contempt for its failure to meet the compliance filing requirements of its march  order 
a hearing on this matter was scheduled for june   which was subsequently cancelled because of the court s june  order  discussed below 
on june   the court issued an order which denied nhpuc s motion for a stay of the court s preliminary injunction 
the order clearly states that no restructuring effort in new hampshire can move forward without the court s approval unless all new hampshire utilities agree to the plan 
the order suspended all involuntary restructuring efforts for all new hampshire utilities until a hearing is conducted 
the nhpuc appealed this order to the united states first circuit court of appeals court of appeals 
on december   the court of appeals announced its decisions on the appeals taken by the nhpuc from the preliminary injunctions issued by the court 
those preliminary injunctions had stayed implementation of the nhpuc s plan to restructure the new hampshire electric industry and required the nhpuc to allow connecticut valley to recover through its retail rates the full cost of wholesale power obtained from the company 
the court of appeals affirmed the preliminary injunction  issued by the court  staying restructuring until the plaintiff utilities claims including those of the company and connecticut valley are fully tried 
the court of appeals found that psnh had sufficiently established that without the preliminary injunction against restructuring it would suffer substantial irreparable injury and that it had sufficient claims against restructuring to warrant a full trial 
the court of appeals also affirmed the extension of the preliminary injunction to protect the other plaintiff utilities  including connecticut valley and the company  although it questioned whether the other utilities had as strong of arguments against restructuring as psnh because they did not have formal agreements with the state similar to psnh s rate agreement 
the nhpuc filed a petition for rehearing on december  the court of appeals denied the petition on january  the court of appeals reversed the court s preliminary injunction requiring the nhpuc to allow connecticut valley to recover in retail rates the full cost of the power it buys from the company 
although the court of appeals found that connecticut valley and the company had made a strong showing of irreparable injury to justify the preliminary injunction  it concluded that connecticut valley s and the company s claims did not have a sufficient probability of success to warrant such preliminary relief 
the court of appeals explained that the filed rate doctrine preserving the exclusive jurisdiction of the ferc over wholesale power rates did not prevent the nhpuc from deciding whether connecticut valley s power purchases from the company were prudent given alternative available sources of wholesale power 
the court of appeals then stated that connecticut valley s rates could be reduced to the level prevailing on december  however  the court of appeals also stated that if a reduction of existing rates were ordered it will be time enough to consider whether they are precluded from the court s injunction against the final plan or on other grounds 
on december   connecticut valley and the company filed a petition for rehearing on the grounds that the court of appeals had not given sufficient weight to the court s factual findings and that the court of appeals had misapprehended both factual and legal issues 
connecticut valley and the company also asked that the entire court of appeals  rather than only the three judge appellate panel that had issued the december decision  consider their petition for rehearing 
on january   the court denied the petition for rehearing 
connecticut valley and the company then requested the court of appeals to stay the issuance of its mandate until the companies could file a petition for certiorari to the united states supreme court and the supreme court acts on the petition 
on january   the court of appeals denied the request 
however  the court of appeals granted a day stay to enable the company to seek a stay pending certiorari from the circuit justice of the supreme court 
on february   the company and connecticut valley filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court and a motion to stay the effect of the court of appeals decision while the case was pending in the supreme court 
the motion for a stay was addressed to justice souter who is responsible for such motions pertaining to the court of appeals for the first circuit 
on february   justice souter denied the stay pending the petition for certiorari 
no decision has been made by the supreme court regarding the petition for certiorari 
on november   connecticut valley filed with the nhpuc its annual fac ppca rates to be effective january  on january   the nhpuc issued an order allowing connecticut valley to increase the proposed fac rate of 
per kwh and the proposed ppca rate of 
per kwh rate on a temporary basis  effective on all bills rendered on or after january  in that order the nhpuc reiterated its intent that  in the event the district court s april  preliminary injunction was vacated  the nhpuc would lower cvec s rates at least to the december  level and require a refund for all funds collected in over that amount 
as a result of legal and regulatory actions discussed above  connecticut valley no longer qualifies for the application of sfas no 
 and wrote off all its regulatory assets associated with its new hampshire retail business estimated at approximately million on a pre tax basis 
in addition  connecticut valley recorded estimated total losses of million pre tax for disallowed power costs of million and refund obligations of million 
company management  however  continues to believe that the nhpuc s actions are illegal and unconstitutional and will present its arguments in the appropriate forums 
the pre tax losses described above resulted in connecticut valley violating applicable covenants in its outstanding loan  which if not waived or renegotiated  allows connecticut valley s lender the right to accelerate the repayment of a million loan with connecticut valley 
at a status conference on february   the court indicated that it would not establish a trial date on the company and connecticut valley s request for a permanent injunction until all pending motions  including a motion to dissolve the stay of restructuring activities filed by the nhpuc  and motions for summary judgement filed by the nhpuc  the company and other parties were heard and decided 
such an injunction  if granted  could require the nhpuc to allow connecticut valley to recover the full cost of the wholesale power obtained from the company through its retail rates 
however  the company cannot predict the outcome of this or any of the other related litigation 
on june   the company filed with the ferc a notice of termination of its power supply contract with connecticut valley  conditional upon the company s request to impose a surcharge on the company s transmission tariff to recover the stranded costs that would result from the termination of its contract with connecticut valley 
the amount requested was million plus interest at the prime rate to be recovered over a ten year period 
in its order dated december  in docket no 
er  the ferc rejected the company s proposed stranded cost surcharge mechanism but indicated that it would consider an exit fee mechanism for collecting stranded costs 
the ferc also rejected the company s arguments concerning the applicability of stated ferc policies regarding retail stranded costs  multi state regulatory gaps and the implications of state restructuring initiatives 
the company filed a motion seeking rehearing of the ferc s december  order which was denied 
thereafter  the company appealed the ferc s decision to the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
in addition  and in accordance with the december  ferc order  on january  the company filed a request with the ferc for an exit fee mechanism to collect million in a lump sum  or in installments with interest at the prime rate over a ten year period  to cover the stranded costs resulting from the cancellation of connecticut valley s power contract with the company 
on march   the ferc issued an order accepting for filing the company s request for an exit fee effective march   and set hearings to determine whether connecticut valley will become an unbundled transmission customer of the company  the company s expectation as to the period of time it would serve connecticut valley  and the allowable amount of the exit fee 
the ferc also rejected the company s june  notice of termination indicating that the notice can be resubmitted when the power contract is proposed to be terminated 
on april   the company filed its case in chief before the ferc updating the amount of the exit fee to million which was subsequently amended to million in a lump sum  describing all of the ways connecticut valley will become an unbundled transmission customer of the company subsequent to termination  and establishing the expected period of service based upon the date of termination  whenever that occurs  and the weighted average service life of its commitments to power resources to serve connecticut valley 
had termination taken effect on january  this expectation period would have equaled nineteen years 
on august and  phase hearings were held at the ferc on the issue of whether connecticut valley will become an unbundled transmission customer of the company 
subsequent to those hearings  the parties agreed to go on to hearings on the phase issues addressing the allowable amount of the exit fee without a preliminary determination from the administrative law judge or the ferc on the phase issues 
the company submitted supplemental testimony on phase issues on december  if the company is unable to obtain an order authorizing the full recovery amount of the exit fee  or other appropriate mechanism  the company would be required to recognize a loss under this contract totaling approximately million on a pre tax basis 
furthermore  the company would be required to write off approximately million in regulatory assets associated with its wholesale business on a pre tax basis 
conversely  even if the company obtains a ferc order authorizing the updated requested exit fee  connecticut valley would be required to recognize a loss of approximately million on a pre tax basis unless connecticut valley has obtained an order by the nhpuc or other appropriate body directing the recovery of those costs in connecticut valley s retail rates
