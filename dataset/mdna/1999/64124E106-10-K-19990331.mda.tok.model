the company has not derived any revenue from product sales and  excluding the effect of certain license fees of a non recurring nature received in connection with entering into research and development collaborations  expects to incur significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenues 
revenues to date have come from three collaborative research agreements entered into with pfizer  one collaboration with schering plough  one license agreement with american home products and from interest income 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of income earned under existing or future strategic alliances  joint ventures or financings  if any  the progress of the company s research and development projects  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of proposed products

discussion of the year issue general 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to access scientific data  process transactions  or engage in similar normal business activities 
program 
the company has begun a program to resolve the year issue 
this program consists of four phases assessment  remediation  testing and contingency planning 
the company completed the assessment phase in december and is currently in the remediation phase 
during the assessment phase  the company assessed its products  key financial and operating systems and other systems for year compliance 
the assessment included identifying all critical information technology systems and non information technology critical systems on which the company relies  testing year compliance of such systems  and recommending steps for replacing or making corrective fixes to non compliant systems 
additionally  the company obtained compliance verification from key third party vendors supplying critical parts or services to the company in order to determine their plans to address their own year issues 
upon completion of the detailed assessment  the company concluded that substantially all its key financial operating systems and other systems are year compliant 
however  certain software and hardware components were identified as non compliant 
the company has established a plan to replace this non compliant software and hardware by september also  the company believes that its processes will be unaffected by the year issue 
the testing phase of the program has been on going  and will continue to be conducted as non compliant software and hardware are replaced 
the company estimates that the testing phase is approximately completed as of december  the company currently plans to develop a contingency plan during the third quarter of for any systems not expected to be year compliant by december  costs 
the company plans completion of all phases  including contingency planning  of the year program by the end of the third quarter of all costs associated with the company s year program are being expensed as incurred 
the estimated total cost of the year program is approximately  which primarily includes the cost of employee time spent on the issue  and the cost of replacing or upgrading non compliant software identified during the assessment phase 
costs incurred through december  have totalled approximately  risks 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  the company may not timely identify and remediate all significant year problems and remedial efforts may involve greater time and expense than is currently anticipated 
if such modifications and conversions fail to be made  or are not timely completed  the year issue could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows of the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any year compliance problems of the company or its customers or suppliers will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows of the company 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that a temporary disruption of operations would occur due to any or all of the following unavailability of services from utility companies  delay in receipt of supplies from vendors  having to access archived back ups of databases of stored information  or delays in accessing the company s financial resources caused by problems in the banking industry 
the estimates and conclusions herein contain forward looking statements and are based on management s best estimates of future events 
risks to completing the program include the availability of resources  the company s ability to discover and correct year problems which could have an impact on the company s operations and the ability of suppliers to bring their systems into year compliance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  the company does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk 
additionally  funds available from investment activities are dependent upon available investment rates 
these funds may be higher or lower than anticipated due to interest rate volatility 
capital market risk 
the company currently has no product revenues and is dependent on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through further equity offerings 
the ability of the company to raise funds in this manner is dependent upon capital market forces affecting the stock price of the company
