year readiness disclosure made pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act  pub 
l 
no 
the year presents potential concerns and issues for the company as well as other companies in the information technology industry 
in general  year readiness issues typically arise in computer software and hardware systems that use two digit date formats  instead of four digit dates  to represent a particular year 
users must test their unique combination of hardware  system software including databases  transaction processors  and operating systems and application software in order to achieve year readiness 
year committee the company has established a year steering committee under the auspices of the company s senior technical executive to evaluate  plan and implement policies and practices  including contingency planning  and to address the impact of the year on the company and its products 
the company s year readiness preparations fall into three categories product readiness  addressing product functionality  internal readiness  addressing the year operability of internal information technology it systems and mission critical non it systems  and third party readiness  addressing the preparedness of relevant third parties and the year operability of products furnished for internal use and resale 
after reviewing these areas  the committee has reported to the board of directors specific areas of concern and a plan for resolving and further testing of any remaining year issues 
the committee will also formulate a contingency plan in the event that the committee reasonably determines that certain year issues may not be resolved by the end of or if unforeseen problems arise 
status of investigation product readiness the company has established year date operability standards against which the most current versions of its software products are being tested 
the company has completed testing of its current line of unison r software products and believes the most current versions conform to these standards and are year ready 
in connection with the acquisition of answersoft  inc in may  the company acquired the concerto tm line of software tool products 
the company has completed testing of the current releases of concerto tm software products and believes them to be year ready  except iir 
all versions of iir are believed to be not year ready 
all customers have been told to upgrade to smartroute tm  which is year ready 
despite the company s testing  there can be no assurance that the company s products do not contain undetected errors or defects related to year operability that may result in material costs to the company or that the company s products contain all features and functionality considered necessary by customers  end users and distributors to be year ready 
in early  the company discontinued its computerized automated dialing system cas and communications resource server crs product lines and introduced the unison brand line of software products 
support of the cas and crs products will be discontinued as of december  the company has not tested the cas and crs product lines and believes they do not conform to its test standards and are not year ready 
the company has actively been notifying known users of these products that support is being discontinued and that users may experience year related operability issues 
users of these discontinued or legacy products are being encouraged to migrate to the unison product line 
the company s exposure arising from its legacy products is not known 
the company does expect to incur additional costs associated with migrating users of legacy products  but does not believe these costs will be material 
while the company believes that most of its current releases of products are year ready  other factors may result in an application created using the company s products not being year ready 
some of these factors include improper programming techniques used by third parties in creating the application  customization  or non compliance of hardware  software or firmware not provided by the company with which the products operate 
the company does not believe that it would be liable in such an event 
however  due to the unprecedented nature of the potential litigation related to year readiness as discussed in the industry and popular press  the most likely worst case scenario is that the company would be subject to litigation 
it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by such litigation 
the company has tested only the current versions of its products  and does not plan to test earlier versions of products 
the company believes a substantial number of the company s customers are running product versions which have not been tested and may experience year date related operability issues 
the company is in the process of identifying these customers and encouraging them to migrate to current versions of the products 
further  the company cautions users of such products to conduct their own year operability testing to determine if continued use of the products allows them to meet their own year readiness objectives 
while many customers will be upgraded to year ready versions of products under maintenance coverage  if eligible  in the normal course the company expects to incur some increased expenses associated with the furnishing of upgrades and modifications 
in addition  the ability of the company to implement upgrades in time to meet customer s year readiness requirements requires the continued availability of qualified technical personnel and the company may incur additional costs to attract and retain such personnel as the year draws closer 
at this time the company does not believe that the cost of potential upgrades or modifications will have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
status of investigation internal readiness the company is engaged in conducting a year readiness audit of its internal it systems including telecommunication  facilities management  safety and security systems 
although the company is not presently aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal it and non it systems for the year  the company is continuing its investigation and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unanticipated negative consequences or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which include third party hardware  firmware  and software 
the company anticipates finalizing its testing of internal systems on or about june  status of investigation third party readiness the company is continuing to assess the year readiness of material third parties  such as public utilities and key clients or suppliers  who provide external services to the company 
the company expects to substantially complete these assessments and testing by the middle of the company has certain key relationships with suppliers which furnish components and software used by the company in its products 
if these suppliers fail to adequately address the year issue for the products they supply the company  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  reputation  and financial results 
certain of the company s products contain third party components and software that is integral to its operation for which the cost and time to integrate alternative components or software into these products would be material 
contingency plans and worst case scenario at the present time  the company is in the process of outlining contingency plans to operate in the event that its products  systems  or business partners are not year ready 
if the company s investigations suggest that there is a significant risk that certain products  systems  or business partners might not be year ready  the company will modify its contingency plans accordingly 
costs  source of funds and accounting treatment the company s policy is to expense all costs related to its year compliance program unless the useful life of the technological asset is extended or increased 
the expenses incurred to date have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
at this time  the company intends to fund year expenses through cash flows from operations 
the impact of the year is difficult to discern  but is a risk to be considered when evaluating future growth and performance of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
as of december   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of the company s investments are short term  euro dollar bonds  investment grade commercial paper  and money market accounts that are carried on the company s books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures 
the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalent and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its international subsidiaries are almost exclusively conducted in their respective local currencies 
international subsidiary operating results are translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for the year ended december  currently the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
