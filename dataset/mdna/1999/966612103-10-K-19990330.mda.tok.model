item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of whitney holding corporation the company and its subsidiaries and on their results of operations during  and the company s principal subsidiary is whitney national bank the bank  in which virtually all of the company s operations are contained 
this discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement information contained elsewhere in this annual report  particularly the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior year financial information has been restated to include the accounts of acquired companies accounted for as poolings of interests 
acquisitions accounted for as purchases are included from their respective dates of acquisition 
overview during the three year period ended december   the company made nine acquisitions as discussed in note as a result  the company incurred conversion and other merger expenses related to the acquisitions in each of these three years 
the effects of these tax effected merger related expenses on net income  earnings per share  return on average assets and return on average shareholders equity for each of the years are shown in table table effects of merger related expenses years ended december dollars in millions  except per share data earnings  before tax effected merger related expenses tax effected merger related expenses net income basic earnings per share  before tax effected merger related expenses effect of tax effected merger related expenses

return on average assets return on average shareholders equity  before tax effected merger related expenses effect of tax effected merger related expenses 


return on average shareholders equity earnings before tax effected merger related expenses decreased by million in from positive factors contributing to earnings include increases in net interest income of million  or  and non interest income of million  or 
offsetting these positive factors were a change in the provision for loan losses of million and increased non interest expense of million  or  excluding merger related expenses 
the growth in net interest income was primarily due to a increase in average loans 
the change in the provision for loan losses resulted from a minimal provision arising from pooled entities in  compared to a reserve reduction in the rise in non interest income was primarily due to increases in credit card income and trust service fees resulting from increased business in those areas 
non interest expense  exclusive of merger related expenses  increased from due to the hiring of key personnel  increased incentive compensation expense  unexpectedly high health claims expense  expenses related to the addition of newly constructed branches and the acquired branches in lake charles  louisiana  increases related to the refurbishment of existing facilities  expenses related to enhancements to communications and data processing hardware and software  and increased credit card processing charges resulting from the growth in the related income noted above

commercial real estate loans increased million  or 
this growth came from loans collateralized by income producing properties  as well as from loans secured by other real estate used in commercial operations 
as the page of pages company s markets have expanded along the gulf coast and the louisiana economy has diversified  particularly in the tourism and hotel business in the new orleans metropolitan area  construction and commercial real estate lending has grown to approximately of the loan portfolio as of december  the economies of many of the markets in which the company operates  especially in southern louisiana  have traditionally been dependent upon the oil and gas industry and companies that service that industry 
the company maintains a moderate amount of outstanding credits and loan commitments to customers involved in the oil and gas industry 
at december   outstanding loans to these customers totalled million 
retail mortgage loans increased million  or  in this growth is largely the result of the continued successful marketing of retail mortgage loan products that have been introduced in recent years as an alternative to the conventional mortgage loan products that the company originates for sale in the secondary market 
loans to individuals  other than retail mortgage loans  increased million  or 
these loans include various consumer  installment and credit line loan products 
the growth was  in part  the result of enhanced sales efforts resulting from customer focused sales training provided to the company s retail bankers during table reflects contractual loan maturities  unadjusted for scheduled principal reductions  prepayments or repricing opportunities

management s evaluation of this risk is reflected in its financial statements by the size of the reserve for possible loan losses  the amount of loans charged off and the provision for possible loan losses charged to operating expense 
the company maintains the reserve for possible loan losses at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential losses in the portfolio 
the factors that management considers in determining the adequacy of the reserve include  but are not limited to  credit reviews of individual loans  collateral values of properties securing loans  growth in the loan portfolio  composition of the loan portfolio  and past due and non accruing loans

these charge offs and recoveries created net charge page of pages offs of million in  compared to net recoveries of million in the increase in gross charge offs in is primarily the result of fully reserved charge offs of student loans stemming from a final settlement of a claim by the us department of education doe related to the company s participation in guaranteed student loan programs 
because of anticipated declines in loan recoveries and continued loan growth  management expects net charge offs to grow in future periods 
a minimal provision for possible loan losses of  was recorded in by pooled entities prior to acquisition 
a portion of the million net reserve reduction in reflected the reversal of excess reserves that had previously been established to cover a settlement of claims by the doe related to the company s participation in guaranteed student loan programs 
the reserve reduction in resulted from overall improvement in asset quality coupled with large net recoveries from previously charged off loans

at december   loans internally classified as having above normal credit risk increased approximately million  or  to million  or of total loans  from a historically low level of of total loans at december  this increase is in part the result of four large commercial credits totaling approximately million  which were classified in the latter part of the classification totals at december  were as follows loans as to which there are serious doubts as to full repayment  million  substandard loans with well defined weaknesses that  if not collected  would likely result in some loss  million  and loans with risk characteristics that indicate potential weaknesses that warrant special attention  million 
management continually reviews the loan portfolio to identify potentially weak or deteriorating credits 
investment in securities total investment in securities was billion at december   compared to billion at year end  a decrease of million 
the average total investment portfolio was billion in  compared to billion in  a decrease of million 
funds from investment maturities  in particular us treasury securities  were used to fund increased loan demand 
the weighted average maturity of the overall securities portfolio was months at december  the weighted average tax equivalent portfolio yield was at december   a decrease of basis points from page of pages at december   reflecting the maturities of older higher yielding securities

tax exempt yields are expressed on a tax equivalent basis 
these securities have no stated maturities or guaranteed dividends 
these securities are classified as available for sale before maturity 
the actual timing of any such sales  however  is not determinable at year end 
securities classified as held to maturity continued to constitute the bulk of investment in securities and represented of the total investment portfolio at the end of  compared to at the end of securities held to maturity represent those securities that the bank both positively intends and has the ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
securities classified as available for sale constituted approximately of the total investment portfolio at year end and at the end of these securities are reported at their estimated fair values in the consolidated balance sheets 
the net unrealized loss on available for sale securities was 
million at year end  compared to an unrealized gain of 
million at s year end 
these gains and losses are recognized  net of tax  in other comprehensive income and in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
the bank does not normally maintain a securities trading portfolio 
however  immaterial amounts of trading account securities are held occasionally for short periods while buying and selling securities for customers 
such securities  if any  are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the bank held no investment in securities of a single issuer  other than us treasury and us agency securities and mortgage backed securities issued or guaranteed by us agencies  that exceeded of its shareholders equity 
the bank has not had investments or participations in financial instruments or agreements whose values are linked to page of pages or derived from changes in the values of some underlying assets or index 
such instruments or agreements include futures  forward contracts  option contracts  interest rate swap agreements and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics and are commonly referred to as derivatives 
management continues to evaluate the use of and need for such instruments as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes 
deposits and short term borrowings deposits were billion at december  average deposits were billion in  a increase over the most significant growth was in a new premium money market product 
this growth was partially offset by slight declines in now and savings deposits 
as shown in table  time deposits  which are primarily certificates of deposits  rose in and represented of total deposits

average short term borrowings in were million  compared to million in this decrease was in part the result of a decline in the number of smaller correspondent banks in the bank s market area 
in the normal course of business  funds are purchased from downstream correspondent banks  which have declined over the year due to various bank acquisitions  including those made by the company 
page of pages liquidity the object of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the cash flow needs of the company and the bank 
liquidity is provided by a stable base of funding sources  including low cost core deposits  and an adequate level of maturing assets 
the company models liquidity needs on a periodic basis to determine the best strategy of investments and borrowings to meet those needs 
the bank had over billion in unfounded loan commitments outstanding at december   a slight decrease from the level at s year end 
note shows the details of these and other unfunded commitments at december  and because commitments and unused lines of credit may  and many times do  expire without being drawn upon  unfunded balances do not represent actual future liquidity requirements 
in order to ensure adequate liquidity  the company has developed an investment strategy  which plans a level of investment maturities that management considers adequate to meet funding needs 
in addition the company and the bank also have access to external funding sources in the financial markets 
asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company and the bank use a number of methods to measure rate sensitivity  including gap analysis  net interest income simulations and monitoring the economic value of equity 
the simplest measure of interest rate sensitivity is gap analysis  which details the contractual maturities  prepayments or repricing mismatches for assets and liabilities within specified time periods 
gap analysis has several limitations  including the fact that it is a point in time measurement 
table demonstrates the company s static gap position as of december  page of pages table interest rate sensitivity by maturity or repricing dates at december  after non interest dollars in millions days days days days year bearing total assets securities available for sale securities held to maturity  loans   federal funds sold and short term investments other assets total assets   sources of funds savings deposits now and money market deposits   time deposits  short term borrowings non interest bearing demand deposits   other liabilities shareholders equity total sources of funds    interest rate sensitivity gap   cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total earning assets table indicates that the company is liability sensitive 
however  static gap analysis does not take into consideration the actions that management intends to take to maximize net interest income over time 
the assets and liabilities of the company are constantly managed to limit changes in earnings due to changes in interest rates 
a more sophisticated tool used by the company to test its interest rate sensitivity is a net interest simulation model  which tests the bank s reaction to various economic environments 
the model s assumptions incorporate management s expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
in general  the simulations indicate that the company is actually moderately asset sensitive 
balance sheet simulations were run at year end to determine the impact of various rate scenarios on net interest income for the next twelve month period 
a base case scenario used a rate forecast which showed a slight decline in rates throughout totaling basis points 
the results of this simulation reveal an increase in net interest income of approximately million  or  from levels after consideration of projected asset and liability volumes 
when the balance sheet simulations were subjected to parallel up and down shifts of to basis points  these rate shocks showed an annual impact on the company s net interest income from a positive million at basis points up to a negative million at basis points down 
the results of these simulations show that the bank was within acceptable limits  considering established guidelines 
the method used for measuring longer term interest rate risk is the economic value of equity analysis 
at year end  the company s sensitivity was acceptable at all levels of rate shock simulation 
the actual impact of changing interest rates on net interest income is dependent upon many factors including the growth of earning assets  the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the timing of repricing of assets and liabilities  the magnitude of interest rate changes  interest rate spreads and the level of success of asset liability management strategies implemented 
page of pages changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
note contains information regarding these fair values 
the differences between fair values and book values were primarily the result of differences between contractual and market interest rates at each year end 
fluctuations in fair values will occur as interest rates change 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
inflation and changing prices may have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
changing prices also affect other expenses that fluctuate as economic environments change 
management believes the most significant impact of inflationary economic cycles on financial results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed above  management attempts to maintain a balance in its maturity and repricing structure to minimize the effects of economic cycles on the company s net interest income 
capital adequacy at december   shareholders equity to total assets was  compared to in the company s risk based regulatory ratios  shown in table  declined in these declines were consistent with the growth between periods in total risk weighted assets 
loan growth  which was partly funded by maturities of generally lower risk weighted investment securities  was the main factor contributing to the rise in risk weighted assets 
table risk based capital and capital ratios dollars in thousands tier capital      tier capital      total capital      risk weighted assets      ratios leverage ratio tier capital total capital equity ratio tangible equity ratio the regulatory capital ratios of the bank far exceed the minimum required ratios  and the bank has been categorized as well capitalized in the most recent notice received from its primary regulatory agency 
year remediation the year situation arose because many existing computer programs used only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
inherent risks to the company with respect to the year situation include potential losses related to data processing and other systems that may not operate as expected  disruption of company operations resulting from technological malfunctions from within the company s internal communications and other processing systems  business problems associated with key third party vendors and other external service providers that may not be year system compliant  credit quality issues that may arise with respect to significant customers that may not be year system compliant  liquidity issues arising from potential withdrawals of cash by customers during late and early  as well as other business and economic risks that may result from the pervasive impact that the year situation could have on overall social and economic conditions 
page of pages in response to year issues  a company wide task force developed a plan to review and test the company s systems and other business operations in relation to year compliance 
to date  the task force has identified appropriate remediation action steps  and system revisions and or upgrades are being made  where appropriate 
these remediation action steps also include non information technology systems that employ embedded technology  such as facilities control systems 
the company had its internal mission critical systems substantially remediated and tested for year compliance by the end of all mission critical systems arc planned to be placed back into production by march remediation and testing of other systems and business operations are underway and are anticipated to be fully compliant and in production by june approximately of mission critical systems were compliant as of december  processes and procedures are in place to ensure that all projects undertaken in the interim deliver year compliant solutions  all future third party hardware and software acquisitions are year compliant  and all commercial third party service providers are queried regarding their year compliance plans 
non interest expense in includes direct costs incurred in connection with the company s efforts to ensure that its operations will not be significantly affected by the use of the year in its computer systems or other systems or in the systems of its suppliers and customers 
the majority of systems remediation costs have been borne by third party vendors who supply the software under annual maintenance fees 
the company s costs for installation of vendor remediated software fall within the business as usual budget 
expenditures for vendor maintenance and specific software costs related to the year items have been approximately million 
internal costs associated with year compliance were approximately million in the company s remaining cost of system remediation is estimated to be an additional million 
this estimate includes an additional 
million of internal costs 
the bank started working with certain of its borrowing customers in early relative to understanding and assessing the customers progress concerning the year situation 
these customers represent most of the bank s investment in commercial loans and assert that they are compliant with year needs or will be by the middle of the small number of customers who do not have adequate plans to assure compliance with year needs are receiving extra attention 
this attention includes internal training of the bank s account officers on methods to assist customers as well as protect the bank s interests and counseling directly with customers to assist them in avoiding disruption to their businesses 
the company is also dependent upon customers and others for deposits and other funding sources to fund its assets 
in a process similar to that used for borrowing customers  the company sent assessment questionnaires to major depositors and investment counter parties 
these responses have been used to assess the possible impact from year problems on the company s ability to secure sufficient funding to support its operations and have been included in its asset liability and liquidity modeling and planning 
the company has also initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which it is vulnerable to those third parties failures to remediate their own year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other organizations upon which the company s operations rely  including essential utilities and telecommunications providers  will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a materially adverse effect on the company 
because there is no generally accepted definition of year compliant and the ability of any organization s systems to operate reliably after midnight on december  is dependent upon factors that may be outside the control of  or unknown to  that organization  no certification of compliance is possible by any business 
for example  in securities and exchange commission sec staff legal bulletin no 
 the sec opined that it is not  and will not  be possible for any single entity or collective enterprise to represent that it has achieved complete year compliance and thus to guarantee its remediation efforts 
the problem is simply too complex for such a claim to have legitimacy 
efforts to solve year problems are best described as risk mitigation 
consequently  the company cannot so certify either 
although the company believes the likelihood of any or all of the above risks occurring to be low  specific contingency plans have been developed in the event that efforts to remediate the company s systems are not fully successful or are not completed in page of pages accordance with current expectations 
the contingency plans are designed to safeguard the company under various year scenarios and are an addition to the company s existing business resumption plans 
while there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely effected by year problems  it is committed to ensuring that it is fully year compliant and believes its plans adequately address the above mentioned risks
