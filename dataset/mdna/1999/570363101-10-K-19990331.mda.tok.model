item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of maritrans inc the corporation  and  together with its subsidiaries and its predecessor  maritrans partners lp the partnership  herein called maritrans or the company 
overview maritrans serves the petroleum and petroleum product distribution industry by using oil tankers  tank barges  tugboats and marine terminal facilities to provide marine transportation and terminalling services primarily along the east and gulf coasts of the united states 
between and  maritrans has transported at least million barrels annually 
the high was million barrels in  and the low was million barrels in many factors affect the number of barrels transported and will affect future results for maritrans  including its vessel and fleet size and average trip lengths  the continuation of federal law restricting united states point to point maritime shipping to us vessels the jones act  domestic oil consumption particularly in florida and the northeastern us  environmental laws and regulations  oil companies operating and sourcing decisions  competition  labor and training costs and liability insurance costs 
overall us oil consumption during fluctuated between million and million barrels a day 
in the fall of  maritrans added approximately  barrels of capacity to its fleet  primarily through the acquisition of three oil tankers varying between  and  barrels of capacity 
in  the company acquired an additional  barrel oil tanker 
additionally  during maritrans successfully rebuilt one of its existing  single hulled   barrel barges with a double hull design configuration which complies with the provisions of the oil pollution act of opa 
the company intends to apply the same methodology to up to eight more of its existing large  oceangoing  single hull barges 
the timing of the rebuilds will be determined by a number of factors  including market conditions  shipyard pricing and availability  customer requirements and opa retirement dates for the vessels 
the opa retirement dates fall between and there are no current plans to perform any rebuilding in legislation the enactment of opa significantly increased the liability exposure of marine transporters of petroleum in the event of an oil spill 
in addition  several states in which maritrans operates have enacted legislation increasing the liability for oil spills in their waters 
maritrans currently maintains oil pollution liability insurance of up to million per occurrence on each of its vessels 
there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover potential liabilities in the event of a catastrophic spill  that additional premium costs will be recoverable through increased vessel charter rates  or that such insurance will continue to be available in satisfactory amounts 
moreover  this legislation has increased other operating costs as maritrans has taken steps to minimize the risk of spills 
among such costs are those for additional training  safety and contingency programs  these expenses have not yet been and may never be fully recovered through increased vessel charter rates 
additionally  management believes that the legislation has effectively reduced the total volume of waterborne petroleum transportation as shippers of petroleum have tried to limit their exposure to opa liability 
this legislation has had a material adverse effect on maritrans operations  financial performance and expectations 
opa is expected to continue having negative effects on the entire us oil and marine petroleum transportation industry  including maritrans 
these effects could include i increased capital expenditures to cover the cost of mandated double hulled vessels expenditures that the independent marine transporters of petroleum may not be able to finance  ii continued increased maintenance  training  insurance and other operating costs  iii increased liability and exposure to civil penalties  iv decreased operating revenues as a result of further reductions in volumes transported on vessels and v increased difficulty in obtaining sufficient insurance  particularly oil pollution coverage 
these effects could adversely affect maritrans profitability and liquidity 
opa will require the retirement of  or retrofitting with double hulls  all single hulled petroleum tankers and barges operating in us waters  including most of maritrans existing barges 
the first of maritrans affected barges are legislatively required to be retired or retrofitted by however  most of maritrans large oceangoing  single hulled barges will be affected january  maritrans barges under  gross registered tons are not scheduled for retirement until the two single hulled tankers purchased in are affected in and  respectively  at which time they will be required to comply with opa or be operated outside us waters 
approximately percent of maritrans operating capacity has been qualified by the united states coast guard as meeting the double hull requirements and  therefore  is allowed to continue operating without modification and without a legislatively determined retirement date 
if maritrans were to replace its entire single hulled oil carrying vessel capacity with newly built double hulled vessels  the estimated cost would be approximately million  based on an estimated replacement cost of per barrel of capacity 
this estimate could be higher as shipyard costs increase 
factors that could reduce the estimate would include decisions to replace less than of existing oil carrying capacity or rebuilding programs with lower replacement costs per barrel of capacity 
maritrans pilot program to rebuild the maritrans with on opa compliant double hull cost approximately per barrel of capacity  however engineering  coating and structural and other vessel and shipyard specific factors may make it inappropriate to extrapolate this per barrel rebuilding cost to the other single hulled vessels in maritrans fleet 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for totaled million compared with million in  an increase of million or percent 
barrels of cargo transported increased by million  from million to million or percent 
revenue and volumes in were positively impacted by the addition of three tankers and two tug barge units in late and one tanker in utilization  as measured by revenue days divided by calendar days available  totaled percent for compared to percent in utilization for the fleet  excluding new vessels  decreased to percent 
the fleet utilization has been impacted by a heavier than normal out of service time due to scheduled maintenance and the maritrans double hull rebuild project 
additionally  the fleet utilization was impacted by higher than normal weather delays in both the gulf of mexico and northeastern united states  two of the company s largest markets 
management expects market conditions to continue to be very competitive as new tonnage is being introduced into the market by maritrans competitors 
revenues from sources other than marine transportation decreased to percent of total revenues in compared to percent in operating expenses of million increased by million or percent from million in this increase was due largely to the full year s operating costs of three tankers and two tug barges units acquired late in and the stub period operating costs of the tanker purchased in august additionally  the company had to charter in outside tonnage  due to an extensive maintenance schedule during the year and the maritrans double hull rebuild project  to cover contract commitments to customers 
the company s oil tankers have a higher operating cost  measured per barrel of capacity  than its tug barge units  due primarily to their larger crew complements and higher ongoing maintenance expenses 
expenses  excluding the new vessels  decreased reflecting lower utilization due to maintenance  heavier weather delays and fuel price savings 
general and administrative expenses increased reflecting higher staffing levels  shoreside travel and shoreside training 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease is the result of a reduction in the effective interest rate as the mortgage debt of subsidiaries is replaced by debt on the company s revolving credit facility 
the company also capitalized interest in the amount of million on various capital projects 
other income decreased from million in  to million in comparable amounts for included a net gain of million on the disposal of certain assets 
interest income decreased to million as the company had less cash and cash equivalents on hand due to its asset acquisitions and capital projects 
net income for the twelve months ended december   decreased to million from million for the twelve months ended december   due to the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for totaled million compared with million in  an increase of million or percent 
barrels of cargo transported increased by million  from million to million or percent 
volumes in the comparable prior period were negatively impacted by the shutdowns of refinery capacity in the delaware valley area during the first part of the increase in volumes in is attributable to improvements in maritrans shorter haul route business as those refineries were placed back in service 
several of the vessels that were reassigned to other geographic areas last year have been moved back into delaware valley based trades 
utilization  as measured by revenue days divided by calendar days available  totaled percent for compared to percent in during  contracts were renewed with some of maritrans larger customers 
while a number of these contracts will result in lower revenue per barrel transported  maritrans has gained either higher vessel utilization or higher volume commitments with those customers  and decreased its exposure to the spot market 
the markets within which maritrans operates continue to experience severe price competition for oil transportation services  which is expected to continue 
management believes  however  that the level of contractually committed utilization will partially insulate maritrans from these pressures 
revenues from sources other than marine transportation decreased from percent of total revenues in to percent in operating expenses of million increased by million or percent from million in the increase was due to the addition of two tug barge units and three tankers in the fourth quarter  which increased vessel operating costs 
prior to the fourth quarter  operating costs had decreased primarily from earlier reductions in owned vessel capacity that maritrans considered excess to its long term needs due to the equipment s size and operating characteristics  and reduced general and administrative expenses 
interest expense decreased by million from million in to million in due to lower levels of principal outstanding 
other income in increased by million from million in to million in due primarily to greater interest earned on short term investments 
net income for increased by million to million as a result of the aforementioned increased revenues and other income more than offsetting the increase in operating costs 
liquidity and capital resources in  existing cash and cash equivalents  augmented by operating activities and financing transactions  were sufficient to fully meet debt service obligations including million in long term debt repayments  to meet loan agreement restrictions  to make capital acquisitions and improvements  and to allow maritrans to pay a dividend of per common share in each of the first three quarters and per common share in the last quarter 
maritrans believes that in  funds provided by operating activities  augmented by financing transactions and investing activities  will be sufficient to finance operations  anticipated capital expenditures  lease payments and required debt repayments 
dividend payments are expected to continue quarterly in on october   maritrans and chevron usa inc chevron executed agreements for maritrans purchase of two chevron petroleum tankers subject to certain conditions 
the total cost to maritrans was approximately million 
the chevron vessels are  deadweight ton  double hulled oil tankers that comply with all international maritime organization imo and opa design criteria for future trading 
the company purchased the first vessel on november   for million and purchased the second vessel on august   for million 
in november  maritrans borrowed million from its revolving credit facility with mellon bank  na to complete the purchase of the first vessel 
to fund the purchase of the second vessel  maritrans borrowed an additional million in august from its revolving credit facility with mellon bank  na the company made modifications to the second vessel  renamed the diligence  before placing it in service in the fall of total costs of these modifications were approximately million 
during  maritrans also successfully completed rebuilding the barge maritrans with a double hull 
the total cost of this project was approximately million 
in addition to the vessel programs previously mentioned  capital expenditures in for improvements to its existing fleet of vessels and marine terminals were approximately million  the same as in on may   the company announced a year s extension to its previously announced stock buy back plan to reacquire up to million shares of its common stock  depending on market conditions 
this amount represented approximately percent of the million shares outstanding at the beginning of the program 
as of the end of the program  the company had purchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
no open market purchases were made in  or on february   the board of directors authorized a share buyback program for the acquisition of up to million shares of the company s common stock 
this amount represents approximately percent of the million shares outstanding at the beginning of the program 
maritrans intends to hold the majority of the shares as treasury stock  although some shares may be used for acquisition currency  employee compensation plans  and or other corporate purposes 
maritrans expects to finance the purchase of any reacquired shares from internally generated funds 
working capital and other balance sheet changes in  working capital was generated by operating activities  proceeds under a revolving credit facility established in and borrowing against a working capital facility 
current assets decreased primarily due to the company having less cash and cash equivalents on hand 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities declined from at december  to at december  maritrans utilized available working capital to purchase marine vessels and equipment  repay scheduled long term debt obligations  and make dividend payments 
debt obligations and borrowing facility at december   maritrans had million in total outstanding debt  secured by mortgages on most of the fixed assets of the subsidiaries of the corporation 
the current portion of this debt at december   was million 
maritrans has a million working capital facility  secured by receivables and inventories of a subsidiary  which expires june   and which it expects to renew 
at december   this facility had a balance of million outstanding 
on october   maritrans entered into a multi year revolving credit facility for amounts up to million with mellon bank  na this facility is collateralized by mortgages on tankers acquired in and at december   the balance of borrowings outstanding were million 
at december  and  total debt to total capitalization was percent and percent  respectively 
for purposes of this calculation  total capitalization consists of long term debt  including those portions that are current  and stockholders equity 
impact of year some of the company s older computer programs and embedded computer components suffer from year incompatibilities 
if left unchanged  this may cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions in operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal similar business activities 
following is a brief description of the tasks incorporated in the company s year effort software inventory list all custom software components that may have a dependency on year software assessment analyze each software component to determine if a year dependency exists  if so then determine magnitude of impact and effort for remediation 
prioritize remediation efforts 
software remediation implement corrections or develop alternative plans to work around the problem 
imbedded systems inventory develop a list of all devices which contain embedded computer chips  such as radars  global positioning system  rudder controls  engine controls and truck rack monitors imbedded systems assessment work with the individual manufacturing companies to identify any problems with specific devices 
conduct independent tests to identify any possible problems 
imbedded systems remediation work with the manufacturing companies to implement replacement or work around plans 
collaborate with other companies that have the same dependencies to reduce cost and increase effectiveness 
service provider assessment verify that all service providers are investigating their own year problems and that the company s interactions with them are year compliant 
identify key service providers and conduct in depth analysis to verify that service to maritrans will not be impacted 
customer assessment verify that all customers are proceeding with their own year efforts 
collaborate with the customers to ensure that both parties have a smooth transition into the new millennium 
contingency planning identify and document contingency plans for core business processes 
the company completed an assessment of its computing systems  commercial off the shelf systems  and embedded systems and has been developing new software programs and replacing commercial systems to take advantage of newer technologies 
as a result of this initiative  the company s operating systems  critical embedded systems and commercial off the shelf systems will be year compliant upon completion of these upgrades  which are scheduled to be complete no later than the first quarter of this date is prior to any anticipated impact on the operating systems 
for the company s less critical commercial off the shelf systems and embedded components  the company is working closely with the manufacturers to verify compliance and is proceeding with remediation efforts 
the company is collaborating with its key service providers and customers to ensure their year efforts will identify and address common risks as well as developing contingency plans where necessary 
the company s major customers do not expect to incur major disruptions in the need for services due to any year issues 
these activities are scheduled to be completed no later than the second quarter of however  there can be no assurances that the companies with which the company does business will achieve a year conversion in a timely fashion  or that such failure to convert by another company will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s contingency planning effort has identified critical business processes and any year dependencies that these processes may have 
the company is currently prioritizing these processes and developing contingency plans to eliminate or manage any year dependencies 
these contingency plans consider the internal systems  facilities  customer and supplier readiness  and infrastructure concerns 
the company believes that with the conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the computer systems 
however  if such conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would be that some of the customers refineries or terminal pumping systems would fail 
this would cause fewer barrels to be moved  interruption of normal distribution patterns  and or inability to transfer product  possibly leaving the vessels empty and crippling the delivery system 
in this event  the company expects less than half of the fleet would be impacted with a maximum of day delays for product loading 
vessels attempting to discharge would be rerouted to other ports or customers and thus not incur significant delays 
as part of the contingency planning efforts  the company is addressing this specific issue internally and with customers to reduce the likelihood and impact of this scenario 
the total cost of the company s year efforts is expected to be million  with approximately million to be incurred during the remainder of the project 
this amount is being financed from internally generated funds 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year conversions are based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to upgrade all relevant operating systems  and similar uncertainties 
market risk the principal market risk to which the company is exposed is changes in interest rates on debt instruments 
the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
the information below summarizes the company s market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents principal cash flows and the related interest rates by year of maturity 
fixed interest rates disclosed represent the actual rate as of the period end 
variable interest rates disclosed fluctuate with the libor and federal fund rates and represent the weighted average rate at december  expected years of maturity thereafter total dollars in s long term debt  including current portion fixed rate        average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate impact of recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information statement 
statement superseded fasb statement no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise 
statement establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
statement also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the adoption of statement did not affect results of operations or financial position 
the company operates in the marine transportation and terminal business 
marine transportation represents the transportation of petroleum and accounted for substantially all of the consolidated assets of the company at december  and and substantially all of the consolidated revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  terminal operations provide ancillary support to the marine transportation business as a discharge location for certain marine transportation customers  tank vessel cleaning facilities for maritrans vessels and as shore based petroleum storage 
the company primarily operates along the coastal waters of the northeastern united states and the gulf of mexico 
the nature of services provided  the customer base  the regulatory environment and the economic characteristics of the company s operations are similar  and the company moves its revenue producing assets among its operating locations as business and customer factors dictate 
maritrans believes that aggregation of the entire marine transportation business provides the most meaningful disclosure
