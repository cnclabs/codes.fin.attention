results of operations as a result of delays in development work and sales of batteries and its inability to successfully complete sufficient debt or equity financing  in february  the company reduced its staffing by approximately to reduce costs 
on june   the company entered into an agreement with kamkorp for up to  of equity funding 
the agreement was structured with the intent of providing additional equity capital combined with battery orders for use in electric vehicles  neighborhood electric vehicles and other applications 
kamkorp is the record owner of  shares or of the company s  outstanding shares of common stock at december  and  including options to purchase common stock is the beneficial owner of  shares or of the company s common stock 
kamkorp appointed three members to the company s eight member board of directors in in late  as a result of delays in development work for new battery designs  management made the decision to focus on sales of its standard production battery and to limit the development work on new battery designs  with the exception of designs using technology in its standard production battery 
the only development programs which remain active are those with fiat auto fiat auto  the defense advanced project agency darpa  the department of energy doe and horizon aircraft 
all others have been terminated by the customer or the company 
such terminations did not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
sales of existing battery types did not increase as expected in due to delays in orders from lockheed martin and others testing the battery for use in new products in emerging markets 
generally  testing of products by customers has taken longer than expected because of difficulties in integration of battery packs in new products 
battery packs are being tested simultaneously with other newly designed components in customer products 
an order for batteries was received from lockheed martin in the first quarter of in july  the company received a non cancelable purchase order for  batteries for delivery during the second half of from eil  a newly formed distribution company owned by kamkorp 
eil  in turn  received a purchase order for  batteries from poem  an emerging malaysian joint venture company  in which kamkorp affiliates hold a significant minority interest  engaged in the production of electric vehicles developed by companies within the kamkorp group 
electrosource delivered  batteries under the purchase order in  which was less than half of the scheduled deliveries under that order 
the shortfall in deliveries was due to the fact that the number of electric vehicles produced and sold by poem to date has been less than anticipated 
the electric vehicle market is an emerging market and sales to date have taken longer than expected to negotiate and finalize 
additionally  vehicle production has been slower than expected 
there have been no deliveries to eil under the  battery purchase order in january  february or march during february  eil and electrosource management renegotiated the payment terms for the  battery order 
advance payments received from eil were used to settle all outstanding invoices for batteries previously delivered 
approximately  of funds remaining from the advance payments will be applied to future deliveries under the  battery purchase order as and when made or for various services which may be performed 
kamkorp management has stated that they believe deliveries under this order or another purchase order will commence early in the second quarter of  but has not provided a definite delivery schedule 
at this time  kamkorp is not obligated to purchase batteries under this order in a specified timeframe 
the company continues to struggle with insufficient sales to fund operations and is completely dependent on kamkorp for funding day to day operations 
although kamkorp has provided substantial amounts of financing to the company to date  as a private company kamkorp is not legally required to  and has not  provided sufficient information to the company to allow the company to determine the financial ability of kamkorp to make the purchases of company common stock in levels sufficient to sustain operations and pay outstanding obligations  which are significant or to regain and maintain compliance with nasdaq minimum listing requirements 
revenue the company generated project revenue of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  approximately  of revenue generated was from the final resolution and settlement of a program with a customer which remains confidential 
battery orders from this customer are not expected in the near future  if at all 
essentially all the remaining revenue generated in was from cooperative development and research agreements with darpa and doe for hybrid electric vehicle hev and electric vehicle ev applications 
the darpa projects are for lead acid batteries  while the doe program is for a lithium polymer which may eventually be used for a wide variety of applications 
development work continues on the fiat program  however no specific payment milestones were achieved during to permit the recognition of revenue on this program 
the fiat program is expected to be complete in late during  approximately  of revenue was generated from smh automobile s 
a 
smh  darpa and fiat for the development and or evaluation of batteries and battery packs for hev and ev applications and  was generated from chrysler for various engineering  environmental and other tests performed on the battery 
approximately  in project revenue in was generated from chrysler for environmental and other tests performed on the horizon battery 
the remainder of project revenue generated in was from darpa  fiat and various others for the development of prototype batteries for ev  hev and portable power tool applications 
the smh program was terminated by the customer in  and in late  chrysler announced its decision to use nickel metal hydride batteries made by a competitor 
project revenue is expected to continue to decline in as the company focuses its efforts on sales of its standard production battery 
the company had battery sales of approximately   and  for the years ending december   and  respectively 
approximately of battery sales were to eil 
the company is actively seeking new customers and markets for its products  however  it is currently economically dependent on kamkorp and its affiliates see liquidity and capital resources section below 
management expects that sales to companies within the kamkorp group will increase as a percentage of total battery sales and that those companies will remain the largest customer for horizon batteries in approximately  and of  and battery sales  respectively  were to chrysler 
although chrysler announced its decision to use nickel metal hydride batteries in its electric minivan for the model year  it has continued to order small amounts of batteries from the company 
management of the company believes chrysler s purchase of a significant number of batteries from the company in the future is uncertain 
approximately and of and battery sales  respectively  were to lockheed martin for use in hevs and evs it is producing for fleet consumers for testing and evaluation 
sales of batteries to lockheed martin are expected to increase slightly in lockheed martin produces a drive train used in hybrid buses manufactured by the orion bus company and others 
the new york transit authority is currently testing a hybrid diesel bus on the streets of new york city manufactured by orion  which is powered by a lockheed martin drive train and electrosource batteries 
the test is expected to conclude in the second quarter of if the results of such tests are favorable  the new york transit authority may place an order for the hybrid buses powered by horizon batteries in the second or third quarter of  however  the amount and timing of such orders remains uncertain 
the remainder of battery sales in all years were from numerous customers requesting batteries for testing and evaluation 
battery sales have remained very low in the first quarter of management expects the level of battery sales to increase beginning in the second quarter of  and battery shipments to eil are expected to increase 
additionally  management expects to receive federal aviation administration faa certification of its battery design used in helicopter starting applications  in the second quarter of  at which time sales of these batteries are expected to commence 
however  the amount and timing of any of these sales remains uncertain 
the majority of these applications are in emerging markets and the entry of final products into such markets is difficult to predict 
during  the company received a  purchase order from chrysler  which replaced an earlier purchase order for  the  purchase order was paid in full in chrysler designated  for the purchase order as a cancellation fee from the previous order and  for batteries to be delivered in the future 
during  the company recorded  as income as all tasks necessary to earn the income were performed and there were no further obligations related to such revenue 
approximately  of the battery revenue remains deferred at december  a portion of the batteries were delivered in and will be recognized upon shipment of the batteries 
in july  the company received a  payment from chrysler 
chrysler designated  of this payment as compensation for continued capacity maintenance and ramp up costs incurred by the company in relation to its role as a supplier to the automaker for its epic minivan program and  for various engineering  research and development er d efforts 
during  the company recorded  as income as all tasks necessary to earn the income were performed and there were no further obligations related to such revenue 
the company recorded  as deferred revenue which was recognized as income in as the er d tasks were performed 
costs and expenses manufacturing costs increased by approximately  or during which correlates with the increase in battery sales for the same period 
manufacturing costs have remained high as a percentage of battery sales primarily due to the fact that the company has not had the capital required to further automate the production processes  materials are being purchased in low volumes and the fixed facility costs of leasing and maintaining its  square foot facility are significant 
management expects that manufacturing costs can decrease as a percentage of battery sales if  and when  volume production begins  however  additional capital will be required for manufacturing tooling required for higher production volumes in order to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and to lower raw material costs 
the timing and amount of battery orders remains uncertain and the capital which would be required for the related tooling for such orders may not be available to the company 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased by approximately  or during primarily based on the actions taken in february to reduce the workforce and control costs and voluntary salary reductions taken by executive management beginning in early selling  general and administrative costs decreased by approximately  or during primarily due to cost savings associated with the consolidation of the company s corporate and manufacturing facilities into one location in late  combined with cost cutting efforts 
management expects selling  general and administrative costs to remain relatively constant in research and development costs decreased by approximately  or in due to the decrease in work on programs  primarily smh and chrysler 
the amount of development work and related costs have not decreased proportionately with revenue as a larger proportion of development work and related costs were incurred in on programs which did not generate revenue and on cost share programs which generate less revenue than commercial programs 
the company incurred more costs in than in on testing and evaluation of batteries aircraft  helicopter and lawnmower applications and improvements in manufacturing processes and joint research and development efforts with corning 
research and development costs increased by approximately  or in due to the significant increase in development work in associated with the custom design of numerous batteries and battery packs for customers smh  fiat  smud  black decker  chrysler and another which remains confidential  testing and evaluation of batteries aircraft and helicopter starting applications and costs associated with joint research and development efforts with corning to improve the company s products  production processes and automation 
it is anticipated that the current level of research and development expenditures will decrease slightly in due to reductions in work on programs terminated in depreciation and amortization costs decreased by approximately  or during the majority of the decrease is due to the full amortization of purchased technology in october  which resulted in a monthly decrease of approximately  in amortization 
as a result  amortization expense will decrease by approximately  in the remainder of the decrease in is due to the full depreciation of various production pieces of equipment in which remain in use 
interest costs decreased slightly during interest costs relate primarily to the company s previous debt obligations to corning and have greatly decreased due to the company s retirement of its obligations to corning in june during and early  the company issued convertible notes payable to corning with a principal balance of  interest expense consists of interest at the face rate of and amortization of discounts on the convertible notes payable 
in june  the company paid corning  in cash in full settlement of its outstanding obligations to corning 
an extraordinary gain on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately  net of tax  was realized from this transaction 
as a result  interest costs are expected to decrease significantly in as a part of the battery manufacturing process  the company handles and disposes of various hazardous materials such as lead and sulfuric acid 
the company is subject to strict environmental regulations and has incurred significant costs in installing equipment to manage and control hazardous substances and pollution 
as part of its on going operations  the company incurred   and  in non capital expenditures in  and  respectively  to properly dispose of hazardous materials and waste 
as a result of such preventive measures  the company has not incurred significant remediation costs 
management is not currently aware of any material infrequent or non recurring clean up expenditures to be incurred in the future based on present circumstances and conditions 
the company has completed an internal assessment of its information technology systems readiness for the year and currently believes that the internal modifications necessary for the year are not significant 
this is because the company s information systems are not complex and have been purchased installed over the last few years and the company believes that most of the related software is year compliant or year compliant replacements are readily available 
the company also believes embedded software in its manufacturing production equipment is either not year sensitive or was developed considering the impact of the year issues 
the company began testing its systems for the year readiness in and the project is estimated to be complete in late  prior to any estimated impact 
the company does not expect the costs of this project to be material or for it to have a significant effect on operations and believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
the company has not completed its external assessment with key customers and suppliers to determine their ability to achieve timely and successful year compliance with their systems equipment 
the company might be adversely affected by the potential failure of its suppliers and customers to remediate their year issues 
the company expects to complete its external assessment of year compliance with key customers and vendors in the second calendar quarter of the company has been and will continue to contact its key customers and suppliers to inquire about their year readiness 
in the event that a supplier will not be year compliant in a timely manner  the company will contact alternate suppliers for the respective parts 
the company has not determined the likelihood of such events as of december  the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
during the years ended december   and  the company issued approximately  shares   shares and  shares of common stock  respectively 
as a result of the increase in shares for these years  the loss per share in each was less than it would have been based on the shares outstanding at the end of the preceding year 
management of the company believes that the issuance of shares in these years was necessary to fund the increased working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company did not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund its working capital needs 
in january and february  the company borrowed the remaining  of convertible notes from corning in accordance with the terms of its  note signed in december existing battery orders and contract work were not adequate to sustain the company on a ongoing basis 
as a result  in february  the company reduced its staffing by approximately to reduce costs and began to explore strategic alternatives 
on june   the company entered into an agreement with kamkorp for up to  of equity funding for  common shares at per share 
in   shares of the company s common stock were purchased by kamkorp for  the agreement requires that kamkorp purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at per share at a minimum rate of  shares per month through july kamkorp is currently making equity payments as they deem necessary  rather than as defined in the schedule set forth in the agreement 
kamkorp s obligation to make these purchases is dependent upon the absence of any material change in the financial position  business or prospects of the company and upon certain other conditions precedent  such as the absence of litigation  absence of defaults on other contracts and agreements  and compliance with environmental regulations 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  kamkorp has nominated three members to the company s corporate board of directors 
kamkorp has the ability to obtain greater than of the outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis and to ultimately have control of the board of directors 
additionally  the company must obtain express approval from kamkorp for all important management policies and decisions 
funds generated in from the fundraising activities above were used to payoff the convertible notes payable from corning principal balance of  was fully satisfied with a cash payment of  to maintain minimum production capabilities and to sustain operations  to design and develop custom batteries and battery packs for several applications and to pay for the lease and maintenance of its  square foot manufacturing facility 
capital expenditures of approximately  were incurred in  primarily related to further automation 
the company received a non cancelable purchase order for  batteries for delivery during the second half of from eil 
during july  the company received  as a down payment in accordance with the terms of this purchase order 
as of december    batteries have been delivered 
there were no deliveries to eil under the order in january  february or march at this time  kamkorp is not obligated to purchase batteries under this order in a specified timeframe 
vehicles sales to date by poem have been less than anticipated 
sales of electric vehicles continue to be difficult to predict as they are in emerging markets 
it is anticipated that companies within the kamkorp group may place additional orders for delivery in  however  there is no guarantee or assurance that any additional batteries will be ordered by  or delivered to  those companies 
from january through march   kamkorp purchased an additional  shares of common stock at per share 
kamkorp management has stated that the remaining and future purchases of common stock more or less than those defined in the agreement will be made in the amount and timeframe they deem necessary to sustain the company s operations and execute the approved business plan 
payments to date have been made in amounts necessary to meet the company s payroll and rent obligations  however  approximately of projected battery sales in the approved business plan are to kamkorp affiliates and the portion of those sales initially expected to occur in the first quarter of did not occur 
although kamkorp has provided substantial amounts of financing to the company to date  as a private company kamkorp is not legally required to  and has not  provided sufficient information to the company to allow the company to determine the financial ability of kamkorp to make the remaining purchases of company common stock 
cash balances have been depleted and the company is currently dependent on cash payments from kamkorp and its affiliates to continue operations on a day to day basis 
the company has approximately  of outstanding accounts payable greater than thirty days past due  most of which is payable to raw material suppliers  some of which date back to june certain of these vendors have threatened legal action for non payment of invoices 
cash generated from battery sales and contracts with other customers is not sufficient to fund operations 
cash payments from kamkorp and its affiliates to date have been sufficient to fund payroll and rent obligations  but not to pay the outstanding accounts payable or raw material purchases 
if a significant battery order is received  significant funding will be required to pay the outstanding accounts payable to allow ordering of additional raw materials 
there is no assurance that future payments from kamkorp or its affiliates  if any  will be made in a timeframe sufficient to sustain operations 
funding beyond the minimum  per month  specified in the agreement  additional battery orders  or other financing will be required in the second quarter of to continue operations  pay outstanding obligations and regain and maintain compliance with nasdaq minimum listing standards 
the company is discussing the possibility of accelerated or additional financing from kamkorp  which could be provided under the terms of the agreement  including kamkorp s exercise of all or a portion of its option to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
absent additional funding from kamkorp or other sources  the company will not have the funds necessary to complete battery orders from kamkorp affiliates or other customers or to pay all outstanding obligations and will not be able to continue as a going concern 
in december  the company issued  shares of common stock to bdm as partial payment for past obligations owed to bdm for occupancy related costs  which the company had accrued and as prepayment under operating leases for manufacturing equipment which are guaranteed by bdm 
the number of shares issued was determined based on the fair market value of the shares at the date of the agreement per share 
when the shares are sold by bdm  the proceeds will be used to satisfy these obligations 
if the proceeds from the sale of such shares are not sufficient to satisfy the obligations  the company will issue additional shares of common stock or pay cash to bdm to make up the deficiency 
bdm has agreed to accept a minimum of per share or  for the shares issued 
bdm will retain any overage from the sale of such shares in excess of the obligations 
the company recorded the shares issued to bdm at fair market value on the date of the agreement  and recorded a subscription receivable for the difference between the fair market value of the shares and the minimum value for such shares accepted by bdm which will be recorded as permanent equity upon final determination of the number of shares to be issued 
the company s market price has been below per share for most of bdm has not notified the company of an intent to sell such shares in the near term  however  unless the value of the company s common stock improves based on current market prices of the company s common stock  additional shares of common stock or cash will be required to settle these obligations under the terms of this agreement 
significant capital expenditures will be required in the future to further automate and achieve consistency in the production process  however  such expenditures are not expected to be significant in to satisfy current battery orders 
there were no significant capital commitments at december  the company s common stock is traded in the over the counter market and is reported on the nasdaq stock marketsr nasdaq 
in order to maintain listing by nasdaq under rules which went into effect in february  the company must maintain a minimum  of net tangible assets total assets  excluding goodwill  minus total liabilities 
the company was not in compliance with the requirement before the completion of the financing transactions and debt extinguishment completed in june in april  the company received notice from nasdaq that it must present a plan for compliance with listing standards on or before april  the company submitted such a plan on april  on may   the company was notified by nasdaq that its plan was not accepted and it would be delisted from nasdaq effective the close of business on may  the company filed a request for an oral hearing regarding the decision 
the hearing was held on june  on july   the company received written notice from nasdaq that its shares would continue to be listed on the nasdaq small cap market  as the company regained compliance with the financial listing criteria and provided a plan for continued compliance 
the success of this plan is contingent upon equity funding anticipated to be provided by kamkorp in accordance with the terms of the agreement and successful execution of the company s business plan which includes increased revenues and reduced operating losses and or additional equity funding 
if such funding is not provided by kamkorp or other parties  the company will not be able to maintain the required  of net tangible assets 
additionally  on february   the company received written notice from nasdaq that the closing bid price of its shares fell below for consecutive trade dates and therefore did not meet the nasdaq minimum listing requirements 
the written notification stated that within calendar days of the notification  the company s closing bid price must be or higher for ten consecutive trading days to satisfy the requirement 
this requirement was met on or about february  as of march   the company s net tangible assets were less than  as a result  the company was not in compliance with the minimum listing requirements of nasdaq and has advised nasdaq of that fact 
the failure to maintain net tangible assets in excess of nasdaq minimum levels has resulted in part from the failure of the company to complete battery orders with eil and others  resulting in larger than expected net losses  and in part from the fact that kamkorp did not make the anticipated purchases of company common stock as of march  kamkorp had advised the company it would make the required equity investment by that date based on kamkorp s belief that it would by then have received a purchase order and downpayment from eil 
eil  in turn  was awaiting the receipt of a purchase order and downpayment from poem  a malaysian joint venture in which kamkorp affiliates hold a significant minority interest 
the battery order was not finalized in time to make the equity payment  in addition  the company had not  at that date  provided kamkorp with the necessary information for the determination of the minimum required additional equity investment 
since march  kamkorp has provided approximately  in new equity funds 
kamkorp has advised the company that it will provide additional equity funding sufficient to meet the nasdaq minimum requirements on receipt of the anticipated purchase order and downpayment  through eil  from poem and of budget information from the company sufficient to allow kamkorp to determine the extent of funds required 
kamkorp expects that this will occur by the end of april as of march   kamkorp is the owner of  shares or of the company s common stock and has the ability to obtain greater than of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis and to ultimately have control of the board of directors 
at this time  the consequences to the company of the current non compliance are unknown 
ordinarily  before  delisting  nasdaq will allow the company notice and an opportunity to present and carry out a plan for compliance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet the minimum listing requirements of nasdaq and remain listed in the future 
in the event that the common stock were no longer traded on the nasdaq market  brokers and dealers effecting trades in the common stock would become subject to the securities and exchange commission rules covering trading in penny stocks 
these rules generally require that such broker dealers make specific disclosures to customers including information on available bid and asked prices for the stock in question and compensation to the broker dealer and his associates with respect to the proposed trade  and provide periodic reports as to the market value of a customer s position in penny stocks 
the rules also impose heightened know your customer requirements that require broker dealers to obtain information  including personal financial information  from customers sufficient to allow the broker dealer to make a determination that the investment in penny stocks is suitable for the customer and that the customer is capable of assessing the risks of such an investment 
broker dealers may be less willing to effect trades in any security subject to these rules due to the additional disclosure  record keeping and other requirements imposed by the rules 
in addition  some potential investors in penny stock may be reluctant to provided the required personal financial information to broker dealers  which may reduce the number of potential investors 
these factors would likely further reduce trading liquidity in the common stock 
if the company were delisted from nasdaq  it would likely be more difficult to obtain additional funding 
there can be no assurance that additional funding which will generate sufficient cash to sustain operations can be obtained on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the company to continue as a going concern 
other in  the company signed a know how license agreement the agreement with horizon battery technologies  ltd 
hbtl  of bombay  india  calling for the completion of several detailed subordinate agreements with the ultimate purpose to license the manufacture and sale of batteries in india 
the effectiveness of the agreement was conditioned upon the subsequent execution of these six related agreements  none of which were executed 
the company believes  therefore  the agreement never became effective and has no force or effect 
separately in  hbtl agreed to pay the company  for a preliminary design review pdr for a potential manufacturing facility in india which was required to complete one of the subordinate agreements 
the company received  from hbtl and completed the pdr in the remaining  was never paid by hbtl  in spite of repeated demands by the company 
in september  the company received a demand from hbtl to arbitrate damage claims for alleged breach of the agreement 
hbtl claimed damages of approximately million for its expenses and lost profits related to the agreement 
the company disputes the claim for damages and will vigorously defend any action taken by hbtl to pursue the claims 
the company also filed a petition in state court in travis county  texas  seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment that hbtl had no right to arbitration or monetary relief 
hbtl contested jurisdiction and removed the proceedings to the us federal court 
the federal district court to which the action was removed ruled that it did not have personal jurisdiction over hbtl and therefore had no power to hear the case 
the company filed an appeal in the us fifth circuit court of appeals from the final judgment and rulings in the federal district court  which denied jurisdiction 
a decision on the appeal is expected at any time 
if the appeal is successful  the us federal court will have jurisdiction to hear the case
