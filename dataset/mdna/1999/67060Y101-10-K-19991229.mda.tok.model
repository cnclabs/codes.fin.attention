year issue many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify years 
these programs were designed without consideration for the effect of the upcoming change in century  and if not corrected  could fail or create erroneous results by  or at  the year essentially all of the company s information technology based systems  as well as many non information technology based systems  are affected by the year issue 
specific systems include accounting  payroll  financial reporting  product formulation and development  manufacturing  inventory tracking and control  business planning  tax  accounts receivable  accounts payable  purchasing  distribution and numerous word processing and similar applications 
non information technology based systems include equipment and services containing embedded microprocessors  such as manufacturing and bottling equipment  clocks  security systems and building management systems 
the company also has relationships with numerous third parties  including material suppliers  utility companies  transportation companies  banks and brokerage firms that may be affected by the year issue 
remediation plans have been established and completed  to the best of the company s belief  for all critical and non critical systems potentially affected by the year issue 
nevertheless  these remediation plans constitute an ongoing process that the company believes will continue beyond the date of this filing 
identification of areas of potential third party risk has been addressed 
no areas of material risk have been identified by the company 
the company believes that it has determined the risks that it would face in the event certain aspects of its year remediation plan fail 
the company has also established contingency plans for all mission critical processes 
under a worst case scenario  the company s manufacturing operations would be unable to build and deliver products in a timely fashion due to internal system failures and or the inability of vendors to deliver raw materials and components 
alternative suppliers have been  and continue to be  identified where possible 
while virtually all internal systems can be replaced with manual systems on a temporary basis  the failure of mission critical systems would have at least a short term negative effect on operations 
furthermore  the failure of national and worldwide banking systems could result in the inability of many businesses  including the company  to conduct business 
the company believes that remediation  risk assessment and contingency plans have been completed satisfactorily 
based on this belief  the company does not expect to experience any material adverse impact to its ongoing operations 
the total cost to the company of achieving year compliance is not expected to exceed  not including internal resources 
spending to date totals approximately  liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal year ended september   net cash provided by operations was million compared to million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily attributable to lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses

the company s investing activities consist primarily of acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  costs associated with capital expenditures 
the higher levels of cash used in investing activities for fiscal and reflect the company s purchases of net assets related to the fiscal acquisitions and the fiscal acquisitions  respectively 
capital expenditures during fiscal and related primarily to manufacturing equipment and information systems required to expand capacity and improve overall operating efficiency 
in fiscal  similar capital expenditures were incurred as well as additional expenditures related to leasehold improvements at the ddo facility 
the company intends to finance anticipated capital expenditures through internally generated cash flow and  if necessary  through funds provided under the new credit agreement 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the company s current financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and repayments under the senior credit agreement and the new credit agreement related to operating needs

the new credit agreement currently makes million of revolving credit borrowings available to the company 
the available revolving credit borrowings are reduced to million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively

upon the occurrence of an event of default under the new credit agreement  the lender may require the company to repay all amounts borrowed thereunder and may proceed against the collateral 
the new credit agreement also restricts the company s ability to make certain payments  including the payment of dividends on its common stock and payments with respect to certain capital expenditures  without the approval of its lenders 
a key component of the company s business strategy is to seek to make additional acquisitions  which will likely require that the company obtain additional financing  which could include the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness 
the company believes that borrowings under the new credit agreement or a replacement credit facility  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to make required payments under the new credit agreement or any such replacement facility  and to make anticipated capital expenditures and fund working capital needs for fiscal new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no
