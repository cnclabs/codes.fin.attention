item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company believes it is a leading manufacturer of fabricated wire products  industrial wire and carbon steel rod for the agricultural  industrial  construction  original equipment manufacturer and retail consumer markets and believes it is the second largest manufacturer of fabricated wire products and industrial wire in the united states based on tons produced  in 
the company s operations benefit from vertical integration as the company s mini mill supplies carbon steel rod produced from scrap steel to its downstream fabricated wire products and industrial wire operations 
these downstream fabrication operations accounted for of net sales 
the company s fabricated wire products typically yield higher and less volatile gross margins compared to rod 
management believes that keystone s fabricated wire businesses insulate it better than other rod producers from the effects of rod imports and new domestic rod production capacity 
moreover  the company s rod production costs have historically been below the market price for rod providing a significant cost advantage over wire producers who purchase rod as a raw material 
during  the company commenced a million capital improvements plan to upgrade certain of its plant and equipment and eliminate production capacity bottlenecks in order to reduce costs and improve production efficiency 
as of december   the company has completed substantially all of the million planned capital improvements 
the principal components of the company s capital improvements plan include reconfiguring its electric arc furnace  replacing the caster and upgrading its wire and rod mills 
as a result of these capital improvements  beginning in  the company expects to increase its annual billet production capacity to million tons from  tons 
although keystone s new billet production capacity is million tons  the company is limited by its current illinois environmental protection agency construction permit to annual billet production of  tons 
keystone has applied for modifications to its permits to allow production of the million ton capacity 
the company s steel making operations  together with billet purchases of  tons and  tons in and  respectively  provided  tons and  tons of billets in and  respectively 
the current estimated annual production capacity of the company s rod mill is  tons 
the lower billet production and purchase volumes in  resulted in rod production decreasing from  tons of estimated capacity in to  tons of estimated capacity 
despite the recent increases to billet production capacity to million tons  the company s rod production is constrained by the rod mill capacity of  tons 
the company anticipates any excess billet production will be sold externally 
the company s estimated current fabricated wire products and industrial wire production capacity is  tons 
utilization of the company s annual fabricated wire products and industrial wire production capacity aggregated in  in and in in november  the company entered into a joint venture agreement and formed engineered wire products  inc ewp 
the company had a equity interest in ewp 
in december  keystone purchased the of ewp not already owned by the company the ewp acquisition 
as part of the joint venture agreement  the company supplied ewp with the majority of its rod requirements 
ewp then converted the rod to fabricated wire products which were primarily used in the concrete pipe and road construction businesses 
during and  the company shipped  tons and  tons  respectively  of rod to ewp 
as a result of the acquisition of ewp  the company was able to convert its lower margin rod sales to ewp  into higher margin fabricated wire product sales 
this change in product mix between and resulted in a decline in overall fabricated wire product selling prices as ewp s fabricated wire products sell for lower prices than do keystone s other fabricated wire products 
the company s profitability is dependent in large part on its ability to utilize effectively its production capacity  which is affected by the availability of raw material  plant efficiency and other production factors and to control its manufacturing costs  which are comprised primarily of raw materials  energy and labor costs 
the company s primary raw material is scrap steel 
the price of scrap steel is highly volatile and scrap steel prices are affected by periodic shortages  freight costs  weather and other conditions largely beyond the control of the company 
scrap prices can vary widely from period to period 
although the average per ton price paid for scrap by the company was relatively constant during and and  respectively  it was in the company s product selling prices cannot always be adjusted  especially in the short term  to recover the costs of large increases in scrap prices 
the company believes certain competitors may increase their rod production capacity in the next few years  which could adversely affect rod pricing generally and increase competition among rod manufacturers 
the company consumes a significant amount of energy in its manufacturing operations and  accordingly  its profitability can also be adversely affected by the volatility in the price of coal  oil and natural gas resulting in increased energy  transportation  freight  scrap and supply costs 
the company purchases electrical energy for its peoria  illinois facility from a regulated utility under an interruptible service contract which provides for more economical electricity rates but allows the utility to refuse or interrupt power to the company s manufacturing facilities during periods of peak demand 
the utility has in the past  and may in the future  refuse or interrupt service to the company resulting in decreased production and increased costs associated with the related downtime 
during the second quarter  keystone entered into a new service contract with the electric utility at the company s peoria facility 
the new contract requires keystone to pay higher rates during months with high demands 
overall  the new contract is expected to increase keystone s energy costs approximately million per year  as compared to the prior contract 
beginning with the acquisition of desoto  inc in september  and through january  the company was also engaged in the manufacture and packaging of household cleaning products through its joliet division 
in january  the company sold the joliet division 
as the operations of joliet were insignificant when compared to the consolidated operations of the company  joliet s results of operations are not separately addressed in the discussion that follows 
in february  keystone formed garden zone  llc  a new marketing and distribution company to supply wire products  wire fencing and wood and plastic products to the consumer lawn and garden market 
the new company was established as a joint venture between keystone and two unrelated entities with keystone owning of the joint venture 
the statements in this annual report on form k relating to matters that are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements found in item business and item legal proceedings  and in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  cost of raw materials  future supply and demand for the company s products including cyclicality thereof  general economic conditions  competitive products and substitute products  customer and competitor strategies  the impact of pricing and production decisions  environmental matters  government regulations and possible changes therein  the ultimate resolution of pending litigation and possible future litigation  and possible disruptions of normal business activity from year issues as discussed in this annual report  including  without limitation  the sections referenced above

net income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased in from during  fabricated wire products represented of net sales as compared to in  industrial wire declined to of net sales in as compared to in  and carbon steel rod comprised of net sales as compared to in the primary reason for the change in product mix was the ewp acquisition in december keystone supplied ewp with the majority of ewp s rod requirements prior to the acquisition 
as a result of the ewp acquisition those sales are now reflected as sales of fabricated wire products 
fabricated wire products selling prices declined while shipments increased in as compared to the primary reason for the decline in fabricated wire product selling prices during was the ewp acquisition 
ewp s fabricated wire products sell for lower overall prices than do the remainder of the company s fabricated wire products 
industrial wire prices remained relatively level in as compared to prices while shipments declined 
carbon steel rod selling prices declined during as compared to while shipments declined 
the decline in rod shipments to external customers was due primarily to the ewp acquisition and an increase in low cost imported rod during gross profit declined approximately to million in from million in gross margin declined to from in as higher production costs more than offset higher overall selling prices and lower scrap costs  the company s primary raw material 
the higher production costs were due primarily to a new electrical supply contract at the company s facility in peoria  illinois  unplanned equipment outages during the first quarter  power interruptions during the second quarter and increased costs associated with the start up of the company s capital projects that were completed during the third and fourth quarters of the company believes these start up issues will be resolved during the first half of and the new equipment will be achieving the expected production cost savings by the start of the third quarter 
during  the company purchased  tons of scrap at an average price of per ton as compared to purchases of  tons at an average price of per ton 
the company purchased  tons of billets in at an average price of per ton as compared to  tons of billets in at an average price of per ton 
selling expenses increased to million in from million in  but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in as compared to million in  but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
during  keystone recorded a non cash pension credit of million as compared to approximately million in the company currently estimates  for financial reporting purposes  that it will recognize a non cash pension credit of approximately million in and  does not anticipate cash contributions for defined benefit pension plan fundings will be required in however  future variances from assumed actuarial rates  including the rate of return on pension plan assets  may result in increases or decreases in pension expense or credit and future funding requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company s financial statements reflected total accrued liabilities of million to cover estimated remediation costs arising from environmental issues 
although the company has established an accrual for estimated future required environmental remediation costs  there is no assurance regarding the ultimate cost of remedial measures that might eventually be required by environmental authorities or that additional environmental hazards  requiring further remedial expenditures  might not be asserted by such authorities or private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts accrued 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on august  the company issued million of senior secured notes the senior notes 
as such  interest expense in was significantly higher than average borrowings by the company under its revolving credit facilities  term loans and the senior notes amounted to approximately million in as compared to million in during  the average interest rate paid by the company under these debt agreements was per annum as compared to in the company used million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility and to retire amounts outstanding under the company s term loan 
the principal reasons for the difference between the us federal statutory income tax rate and the company s effective income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s deferred tax position at december  is also explained in note to the consolidated financial statements and in liquidity and capital resources 
the effective tax rates in and were and  respectively 
as a result of the items discussed above  net income during declined to million from million in and decreased as a percentage of sales to from 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased in from fabricated wire products represented of net sales in and in  industrial wire represented in and in  and carbon steel rod represented in and in fabricated wire product prices decreased approximately while shipments increased in from during  industrial wire prices remained level with prices while shipments increased from carbon steel rod prices increased as shipments decreased from to gross profit increased approximately to million in from million in gross margin increased to in from in as increased selling prices and lower pension expense and scrap costs more than offset higher rod conversion costs 
during  the company purchased  tons of scrap at an average price of per ton as compared to purchases of  tons at an average price of per ton 
the company purchased  tons of billets in at an average price of per ton as compared to  tons at per ton in the desoto acquisition in september included the simultaneous merger of the company s and desoto s defined benefit pension plans and as a result  pension expense charged to cost of goods sold in was nil as compared to when the company charged pension expense of approximately million to cost of goods sold 
during  the company recorded a non cash pension credit of approximately million 
selling expenses increased to million in from million in but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  in this decrease was primarily a result of lower environmental expenses in partially offset by a million charge to bad debt expense recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting from a severe deterioration in a customer s financial condition 
in august  the company recorded a pre tax gain in other income of approximately million resulting from the sale of a building that was used by one of the company s former operating divisions 
the operating division was sold in  but the company retained the building 
interest expense in was higher than due principally to higher average borrowing levels and higher average interest rates as a primary result of the issuance of the senior notes 
both the company s revolving credit facility and term loan bore interest at over the prime rate 
average borrowings by the company under its revolving credit facility and term loan approximated million in as compared to million in during  the average interest rate paid by the company under its revolving credit facility and term loan was per annum as compared to in during the fourth quarter of  based upon revisions in the company s estimate of liabilities for income taxes  keystone reduced its consolidated accrual for income taxes by million 
this change in estimate considered a settlement with the internal revenue service the irs  in the fourth quarter  of a matter related to an appeal of proposed adjustments by the irs for the through tax years on a more favorable basis than originally anticipated 
the effective tax rates in and were and  respectively 
as a result of the items discussed above  net income during increased to million from million in and increased as a percentage of sales to from 
outlook for the company s million capital improvements plan was substantially completed in  and management believes the company will begin achieving the desired cost savings from this equipment by the start of the third quarter 
in addition  management believes scrap costs will continue to remain low and carbon steel rod demand will improve as import prices level off 
as such  although the company will incur some carryover production issues relative to the start up of the new equipment that will negatively impact the first quarter and may result in a net loss  management expects the company to be profitable for calendar liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of  including million of notes payable and current maturities of long term debt as well as outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities of million 
the amount of available borrowings under these revolving credit facilities is based on formula determined amounts of trade receivables and inventories  less the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
under the terms of the indenture related to the senior secured notes  the company s ability to borrow in excess of million under its million revolving credit facility is dependent upon maintenance of a consolidated cash flow ratio as defined in the indenture of at least to for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters 
unused credit available for additional borrowings under keystone s million revolving credit facility  which expires december   and ewp s million revolving credit facility  which expires june   were million and million  respectively  at december  all of which could be borrowed under the terms of the indenture 
the company s million revolving credit facility requires daily cash receipts be used to reduce outstanding borrowings  which results in the company maintaining zero cash balances when there are balances outstanding under this credit facility 
during  the company s operating activities provided approximately million of cash  compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in despite the lower earnings in as compared to  cash flow from operations increased in compared to due to relative changes in the levels of assets and liabilities 
during the third quarter of  desoto received approximately million from one of its insurers in exchange for releasing the insurer from coverage for certain years of environmental related liabilities 
such amount is included in the company s self insurance accruals at december  and immediately following the desoto acquisition in  keystone was obligated to  and did  cause desoto to pay certain of desoto s trade creditors the trade credit group of the balance of the trade payables then due to the trade credit group 
the remaining of the balance million due to the trade credit group  plus interest at  was paid by desoto in february prior to its acquisition by keystone  desoto received a report of tax examination changes from the irs that proposed adjustments resulting in additional taxes  penalties  and interest for the years through desoto filed a formal appeal of the proposed adjustments  and in prior years  accrued an estimate of its liability related to this matter 
in the fourth quarter of  desoto settled the matter with the irs for a payment of approximately million  including interest of approximately million 
such payment was less than previously accrued amounts and  as such  in the fourth quarter  keystone reduced its consolidated accrual for income taxes by million 
in february  the company purchased certain agricultural fencing product manufacturing equipment and related inventory from insteel industries  inc insteel  for approximately million 
keystone also incurred capital costs of approximately million to relocate and integrate such equipment into its manufacturing facilities 
as part of the agreement with insteel  keystone also acquired insteel s former customer list and certain other records and insteel agreed not to compete with keystone in the north american agricultural fencing products business for a period of five years 
during  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million primarily related to upgrades of production equipment at its facility in peoria  illinois and the insteel equipment purchase 
during  the company commenced a three year  million capital improvement plan to upgrade certain of its plant and equipment and eliminate production capacity bottlenecks in order to reduce costs and improve production efficiency 
the principal components of the company s capital improvements plan include reconfiguring its electric arc furnace  replacing the caster and upgrading its wire and rod mills 
keystone completed the installation of the new caster in the third quarter of capital expenditures for are currently estimated to be approximately million and are related primarily to upgrades of  as well as additional  production equipment 
these capital expenditures will be funded using available cash and borrowing availability under the company s revolving credit facilities 
at december   the company s financial statements reflected accrued liabilities of million for estimated remediation costs arising from environmental issues 
there is no assurance regarding the ultimate cost of remedial measures that might eventually be required by environmental authorities or that additional environmental hazards  requiring further remedial expenditures  might not be asserted by such authorities or private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts accrued 
in february  keystone formed garden zone  llc  a new marketing and distribution company to supply wire products  wire fencing and wood and plastic products to the consumer lawn and garden market 
the new company was established as a joint venture between keystone and two unrelated entities with keystone owning of the joint venture 
the company does not anticipate any significant capital expenditures will be required to fund or operate this joint venture 
in january  the company s pension plan  which owned the real property associated with the operation and the company  sold the joliet division for aggregate consideration of approximately million in cash and million in notes 
the company does not expect to be required to make contributions to the pension plan during future variances from assumed actuarial rates  including the rate of return on pension plan assets  may result in increases or decreases to pension expense or credit and funding requirements in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company incurs significant ongoing costs for plant and equipment and substantial employee medical benefits for both current and retired employees 
as such  the company is vulnerable to business downturns and increases in costs  and accordingly  routinely compares its liquidity requirements and capital needs against its estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past  and may in the future  reduce controllable costs  modify product mix  acquire and dispose of businesses  restructure certain indebtedness  and raise additional equity capital 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for similar actions or other measures in the future in order to meet its obligations 
the company also routinely evaluates acquisitions of interests in  or combinations with  companies related to the company s current businesses 
the company intends to consider such acquisition activities in the future and  in connection with this activity  may consider issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company 
the company s ability to incur new debt in the future is limited by the terms of the indenture 
management believes the cash flows from operations together with available cash and the funds available under its revolving credit facilities will provide sufficient funds to fund the anticipated needs of its operations and capital improvements for the year ending december  this belief is based upon management s assessment of various financial and operational factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions relating to product shipments  product mix and selling prices  production schedules  productivity rates  raw materials  electricity  labor  employee benefits and other fixed and variable costs  working capital requirements  interest rates  repayments of long term debt  capital expenditures  and available borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
however  liabilities under environmental laws and regulations with respect to the clean up and disposal of wastes  the inability to negotiate a satisfactory collective bargaining agreement to replace the expiring agreement at the company s peoria facility  any significant increases in the cost of providing medical coverage to active and retired employees could have a material adverse effect on the future liquidity  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
additionally  significant declines in the company s end user markets or market share  the inability to maintain satisfactory billet and rod production levels  or other unanticipated costs  if significant  could result in a need for funds greater than the company currently has available 
there can be no assurance the company would be able to obtain an adequate amount of additional financing 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
year issue as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
such failures could materially and adversely effect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company is in the process of taking an inventory of its information systems to determine the modifications to existing software and new software required to mitigate any year issues 
the company s evaluation includes information systems infrastructure  financial and administrative systems  process control and manufacturing operating systems as well as significant vendors and customers 
the company expects this inventory will be completed during the first quarter 
because the majority of keystone s significant information systems have recently been installed or updated  many of the company s systems and related software are already year compliant 
keystone is utilizing both internal and external sources to reprogram or replace and test its software and the company expects to have its evaluation completed by the end of the first quarter of and required modifications completed prior to december  although the company expects its critical systems to be compliant by december   there is no assurance these results will be achieved 
however  the impact of a failure of any of the company s information systems would be mitigated to the extent that other alternate processes  including manual processes  were able to meet processing requirements 
presently  keystone expects alternate procedures would be able to meet the company s processing needs 
in addition  excluding recent equipment additions that are year compliant  a significant portion of keystone s plant and equipment is aged and doesn t include imbedded chip technology susceptible to year issues 
keystone relys on third parties for raw materials  utilities  transportation and other key services 
in addition  the company is dependent upon its customers for cash flow 
the company has initiated formal communications with its suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to eliminate their own year issues 
notwithstanding the company s efforts  the ability of the company to affect the year issues preparedness of such customers and suppliers is limited 
keystone presently expects to complete these third party communications during the second quarter and will at that time begin developing contingency plans for potential non compliance by these third parties 
year issues that adversely impact these third parties could also effect the operations of the company 
there can be no assurance the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
because the company has not completed the evaluation of its year issue  it is not able to quantify the costs that may be incurred in order to eliminate any year issues 
the total costs that will be incurred by keystone in connection with resolving its year issues will be impacted by the company s ability to successfully identify its year issues  the level of effort required to remediate the issue and the ability of third parties to successfully address their own year issues 
total costs incurred to date relative to the remediation of the company s year issues have been expensed as incurred and have not been material 
although not anticipated  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of failure by the company or its key suppliers or customers to become year compliant would be short term slowdown or cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more facilities and a short term inability on the part of the company to process orders and billings in a timely manner  and to deliver product to customers 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete its year assessment and remediation are based on management s estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ significantly from those plans 
specific factors that might cause differences from management s estimates include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
management believes the company is devoting the necessary resources to identify and resolve significant year issues in a timely manner
