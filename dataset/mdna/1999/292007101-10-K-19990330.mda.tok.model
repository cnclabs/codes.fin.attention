gross profit margins 
gross profit margins  excluding the sales distribution settlement and the nonrecurring charges  were slightly higher for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to production improvements at the company s tarboro  north carolina manufacturing facility and the increased percentage of sales of higher margin products manufactured overseas

seasonality of sales sales of many products are seasonal in nature 
purchase orders for toys are typically secured in the months of april  may and june so that by the end of june  the company has historically received orders or order indications for a substantial majority of its full year s toy business 
products sold primarily in the spring and summer months include golf shoes and accessories  water works tm pools  crocodile mile r water slides and other items  which are shipped principally in the first and second quarters of the year and counter some of the seasonality associated with the company s toy products 
in addition  certain toys such as big wheel r ride ons  grand champions r horses and buddy l r vehicles ship year round 
sales of holiday products are heavily concentrated in the christmas and halloween shopping seasons with substantially all shipments occurring the third and fourth quarters of the year 
the company s production generally is heaviest in the period from june through september 
typically over of toy product revenues are generated in the second half of the year with september and october being the largest shipping months 
as a result of the seasonality  a disproportionate amount of receivables are collected and trade credits are negotiated in the first calendar quarter of the following year 
the company expects that its quarterly operating results will vary significantly throughout the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company has experienced operating difficulties during the past several years and sales have declined over this period 
the net loss for was million compared with a net loss of million for and a net loss of million for improvements since when the company expanded to absorb two acquisitions include exiting unprofitable product lines  downsizing of operations through the elimination of underutilized assets and excess overhead  streamlining of manufacturing operations and attaining a higher percentage of on time deliveries 
despite the improvements made during and  the company continues to operate under tight cash constraints 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the factors discussed above  among others  may indicate that the company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis  and ultimately to attain profitable operations 
the company had positive operating cash flows during of million  which primarily resulted from converting accounts receivable and inventory into cash 
pursuant to the eighth amendment to the company s secured bank facility  which amendment was effective march   the company  through its domestic operating subsidiaries  has a series of cross guaranteed secured bank lines which currently aggregate up to million million for empire industries and million for the apple companies available for financing 
as part of the empire industries facility  there is a three year term loan of million which requires monthly principal payments of  also  up to million of empire industries availability is not tied by formula to the underlying assets and requires monthly repayment of million commencing september  through february  the balance of the availability of borrowings for each subsidiary under the facilities is based on all domestic accounts receivable and inventory balances as defined  less outstanding commitments under letters of credit 
a substantial portion of the company s shipments in the united states are sold with seasonal dating terms 
payments on sales of the company s spring product lines produced domestically are generally due june th and payments on sales of its fall product lines are generally due december th 
goods sourced in the far east are sold either under bank letters of credit with most payments received within days of shipment or shipped to the u 
s 
and sold with domestic credit terms 
a substantial portion of the company s shipments of holiday products are made on terms that permit payment more than days after shipment of merchandise 
such shipments are generally made after june and require payment by december of the year in which shipment is made 
due to the seasonality of its revenues  the company s working capital requirements fluctuate significantly during the year 
the company s seasonal financing requirements are highest during the fourth quarter and lowest during the first quarter 
empire hong kong  a subsidiary of the company located in hong kong  meets its working capital needs through a bank credit facility which is due on demand 
empire hong kong can borrow up to approximately  at interest rates ranging up to over the bank s best lending rates 
the availability of borrowings is primarily based on empire hong kong accounts receivable and inventory balances  as defined 
all of empire hong kong assets are collateralized under the loan agreements

see legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year readiness the inability of computers  software and other equipment to recognize and properly process data fields containing a two digit year is commonly referred to as the year readiness issue 
as in the case with most companies using computers  the company is in the process of addressing the year readiness issue 
during the second quarter of  the company assigned a manager to the year project and engaged consultants to help evaluate the overall business requirements of its systems 
the company anticipates achieving year readiness for its information technology systems in addition to meeting other customer requirements through the implementation of new software as a result of this evaluation 
the company has selected software which has been installed and is expecting full implementation by the end of the second quarter of also  during the second quarter of  the company began evaluating the year readiness of its non information technology systems 
the company believes that the majority of these systems will not be affected by the year issue  and is evaluating options to address any non information technology systems that will be so effected 
the company expects to have fully addressed any issues for these systems by september  the company has identified third party vendors which could materially impact the business if they were unable to provide goods and services  and is in the process of obtaining representations regarding their year readiness 
the company estimates the total cost for the new management information software  hardware and peripherals will be approximately  during  the company has spent an additional  for consulting fees relating to the evaluation of the business requirements of its management information system and its year readiness 
because of the nature of its business and seasonality  the company feels its exposure to year problems could be contained to specific areas 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario regarding the year issue would be that the new software is not installed in time or that it has functionality issues 
however  in the event that the new management software is not fully functional or if certain non information technology systems have not been updated by the end of  the company would handle any such scenarios by using manual overrides  outsourcing services  or relying upon its current pc based software 
impact of inflation the primary raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s domestic toys and holiday products are petrochemical derivatives  principally polyethylene 
polyethylene prices remained relatively stable during and during prices rose by approximately 
due to the time lag between the purchase of raw materials and the sale of finished goods  results of operations may be only partially affected in the period in which such prices change 
backlog the company had open orders of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
end of year order positions do not yet include orders for fall product lines 
the company believes that because order patterns in the retail industry vary from time to time  open orders on any date in a given year are not a meaningful indication of the future sales 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
the company s primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to its debt and foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
the company finances its working capital needs primarily through a variable rate loan facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the company s results may be adversely or positively affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company sources products from various manufacturers in the far east 
the purchases are generally made in hong kong dollars while goods are sold in us dollars 
due to the small levels of inventory  and the historical consistency of the hong kong dollar u 
s dollar exchange rates  the company does not believe that any adverse or positive affect would be significant
