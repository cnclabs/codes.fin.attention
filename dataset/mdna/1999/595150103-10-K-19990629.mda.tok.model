item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the notes thereto and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of the company 
forward looking information is subject to risk and uncertainty this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty  including management s expectations for fiscal and known trends and uncertainties in the business 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  believes  plans  seeks  estimates and similar expressions or variations of these words are intended to identify forward looking statements  but are not the only means of identifying forward looking statements 
additionally  statements that refer to microware s estimated or anticipated future results  sales or marketing strategies  new product development or performance or other non historical facts are forward looking and reflect microware s current perspective of existing information 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified  and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors including the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  the company s ability to successfully market its products  the company s ability to keep pace with its competition and with rapid technological change  the company s ability to manage turnover in its sales and marketing and other personnel and to attract and maintain personnel generally  as well as other risk factors mentioned throughout this annual report and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
readers are urged not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements and microware disclaims any obligation to update any of the forward looking statements contained in this report to reflect any future events or developments 
the company s operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past  and the future operating results of the company may fluctuate as a result of the above and other risk factors detailed in this annual report and other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in prior years  the company s actual financial performance has not always met market expectations and the company has experienced significant quarterly losses 
it is likely that  in some future quarter  the company s financial performance will again fall below market expectations 
overview microware develops  markets and supports real time operating system software and high level language compilers used in consumer electronics  communications  process control and factory automation  scientific research  and government defense applications 
microware s product line is built around the os family of real time operating systems for advanced microprocessors 
the company s os product family includes options for programming languages  networking  graphical interfaces and productivity tools 
substantially all of the company s revenues in the last and current fiscal years have been derived from licenses and related services from the os product family 
the company has historically derived revenues from development licenses and run time license royalty fees along with sales of related software productivity tools  maintenance support and custom contract engineering work 
custom contract engineering revenues are typically derived from discrete software engineering projects porting the os operating system along with customized software products to a customer s product 
commonly  license royalty fees follow the completion of these contracts and the successful deployment of the customer s product 
for financial reporting purposes  product revenues primarily consist of software licenses and software development tool products  along with license run time royalty fees earned  including non refundable prepaid royalties 
services revenues principally consist of revenues from custom contract engineering and maintenance support agreements  along with consulting and training activity 
a key element of the company s long term strategy is to develop products which can be embedded into successful  high volume customer products  thereby significantly increasing license run time royalty fees 
any increase in the percentage of revenues attributable to license run time royalties will depend on the company s successful negotiation of license run time royalties and on the successful commercialization by the company s customer of the underlying product 
to date  the company has been negatively impacted by target markets  such as cellular phones  two way paging  personal internet devices and digital and interactive television  emerging much slower than anticipated 
in addition  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful when the markets  for which the company products are targeted  emerge 
results of operations amounts and percentage of revenues the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the amount and related percentage of the company s total revenues by each line item

total revenues decreased or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during fiscal  the company experienced significant turnover in its sales personnel  particularly in north america and japan 
during fiscal  the turnover in japan was stabilized  however the company experienced significant attrition in its marketing personnel and continued to experience significant turnover in its north american sales personnel 
the significant turnover experienced by the company has had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on the company s operations  the extent of which cannot presently be determined 
product revenues increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in product revenues from fiscal to fiscal primarily stemmed from non refundable prepaid royalties and license fees from motorola for the company s digital tv and java product offerings 
the company continues to be negatively impacted by the slower than anticipated emergence of various target markets  such as cellular phones  two way paging  personal internet devices and digital and interactive television 
product revenues from certain strategic customers including motorola  northern telecom ltd  ericsson and the company s david licensees  continued to fall below management expectations 
future growth in product revenues will continue to be substantially dependent on the company s ability to develop cost effective sales channels in north america and abroad and the company s customers timely and successful development and distribution of new products using the company s products 
each of these factors makes product revenues difficult to accurately forecast on a quarterly or annual basis 
services revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in services revenues primarily resulted from a decrease in funded development of advanced processor ports along with  to a lessor extent  a reduction in david custom services 
international revenues represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the percentage increase in fiscal resulted primarily from a reduction in us revenue compounded by an overall increase in revenues from europe 
the company expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of its revenues although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
in europe and japan  revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the company s operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time 
however  the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

cost of product revenues also includes direct third party royalty expense and amortization expense of purchased and capitalized software 
cost of services revenues includes direct and indirect costs for technical phone support  training and education  and custom engineering 
total cost of revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal overall cost of revenues decreased due to the reduction in total revenues 
as a percentage of product revenues  cost of product revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal cost of product revenues decreased as a percentage of product revenues primarily as a result of marginal efficiencies achieved in the direct costs of producing  packaging and shipping products to customers 
as a percentage of services revenues  cost of services revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the percentage decrease between periods primarily resulted from higher margin custom contract engineering work being performed during fiscal as compared fiscal research and development 
research and development expense includes expenses associated with the development of new products and the enhancements of existing products  and consists primarily of employee salaries and related expenses 
research and development expense decreased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the reduction in research and development expense is a primary result of fewer engineers employed by the company during fiscal the company has made substantial investments in product development 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to enhance its existing products  to develop new products and to maintain technological competitiveness 
consequently  the company anticipates that it will continue to commit substantial resources to product development in the future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of sales and marketing personnel related costs  including sales commissions 
sales and marketing expense also includes costs of advertising  public relations and attendance at industry trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the overall increase was primarily attributable to the company s continued investment in its domestic and international sales and distribution channels and support infrastructures 
in fiscal  the company expects to continue investing in the expansion and development of its sales channels and the upgrading of its infrastructure in addition to increasing marketing activity associated with the release of new products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for administration  finance  human resources and facilities management  as well as legal  auditing and certain recruiting and relocation expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in general administrative expenses primarily resulted from a reduction in recruiting and relocation costs along with costs associated with the move to the company s new headquarters facility 
special charges 
no special charges were incurred during the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company determined that due to revised estimates of the marketability of certain products under development  a special charge of  was appropriate to more adequately reflect the residual value of certain intangible assets 
included in this charge was approximately  of deferred development costs in the form of prepaid royalties  approximately  relating to goodwill associated with micromall  inc  a subsidiary of the company  and approximately  relating to the write off of previously capitalized purchased technology 
other income expense 
other income decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease between periods resulted from gains on the sale of the company s interest in unwired planet inc and its former headquarters facility of  and  respectively  in fiscal in addition  other income decreased due to a reduction of interest income due to cash used in operations  and an increase in interest expense related to the company s long term debt on its new headquarters facility 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues 
total revenues decreased or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in product revenues from fiscal to fiscal stemmed from a reduction in large oem licenses along with a reduction in nonrefundable prepaid royalties recognized from customers 
services revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in services revenues primarily resulted from a decrease in funded development of advanced processor ports along with  to a lessor extent  a reduction in david custom services 
international revenues represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of its revenues although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
in europe and japan  revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in local currencies 
in fiscal and  the us dollar strengthened against many foreign currencies which resulted in relatively lower revenues when translated into us dollars 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal overall cost of revenues decreased due to the reduction in total revenues 
as a percentage of product revenues  cost of product revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal cost of product revenues increased as a percentage of product revenues primarily as a result of an increase in amortization expense relating to purchased software and an increase in direct third party royalty expense 
amortization of capitalized software amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
as a percentage of services revenues  cost of services revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the percentage increase between periods primarily resulted from small  lower margin custom contract engineering work being performed during fiscal compared to large  higher margin custom contract engineering work being performed in fiscal research and development 
research and development expense remained at million in fiscal and although such expense constituted a greater percentage of revenues in fiscal due to lower revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the overall decrease was primarily attributable to significant turnover in the company s sales force in north america and japan 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in general administrative expenses resulted from costs incurred due to organizational changes in the company s operations during fiscal these costs included severance and related benefits associated with the elimination and resignation of employees of approximately  moving costs to the company s new headquarters facility of approximately  and recruiting and relocation costs associated with the hiring of new executive management and sales personnel in the us and japan of approximately  special charges 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company determined that due to revised estimates of the marketability of certain products under development  a special charge of  was appropriate to more adequately reflect the residual value of certain intangible assets 
included in this charge was approximately  of deferred development costs in the form of prepaid royalties  approximately  relating to goodwill associated with micromall  inc  a subsidiary of the company  and approximately  relating to the write off of previously capitalized purchased technology 
other income expense 
other income increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase between periods resulted from gains on the sale of the company s interest in unwired planet inc and its former headquarters facility of  and  respectively 
these increases were offset by a reduction of interest income due to cash used in operations  and an increase in interest expense related to the company s long term debt on its new headquarters facility 
variability of quarterly operating results the company s revenues and operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company believes its revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon such factors as new product introductions by the company or others  seasonality of customer buying patterns  the company s sales commission plan  renewals of product licenses by customers  product development and marketing expenses  changes in company and competitors pricing policies  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  the mix of international versus domestic revenues  currency fluctuations  the existence of product errors and the hiring and training of additional staff 
furthermore  delays in closing product licensing transactions or in completion of custom contract engineering work during any quarter could cause quarterly revenues and net earnings for that quarter to fall below anticipated levels 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a relatively small number of large account customers  therefore any delay in the consummation of business with this small number of customers could significantly impact the company s quarterly performance 
the majority of the company s revenues in a quarter has been historically derived from orders received in the last month of that quarter  which makes the company s financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn in business and makes quarterly results difficult to forecast 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based on present expectations of future revenue levels  and a shortfall in revenues could result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net earnings 
as the markets in which the company compete mature and as new and existing companies compete for customers  price competition is likely to intensify and such competition could adversely affect quarterly operating results 
variations in product mix may also affect gross profit margin percentages 
therefore  although the company s revenues and gross profit in any period may increase in absolute terms  such an increase may result in lower gross profit margin percentages 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically funded its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  the sale of common and preferred stock and  to a lesser extent  long term debt 
at march   the company had approximately  in working capital and  in cash and short term investments as compared to  in working capital and  in cash and short term investments at march  the decrease in working capital and cash and short term investments resulted principally from the use of cash during fiscal for operating activities 
cash used in operating activities amounted to   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the cash used in operations in fiscal primarily resulted from the net loss of  additionally significant uses of cash resulted from an increase in other assets including purchased software of  and a decrease in accounts payable of  these uses of cash in fiscal were partially offset by a decrease in trade receivables of  and other reconciling items of  the cash used in operations in fiscal primarily resulted from the net loss of  cash provided by used in investing activities was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal  uses of cash resulted from approximately  of cash being used to purchase land and construct the company s new corporate headquarters facility 
in addition  an approximate net  of cash was used to purchase of short term investments and  was used to purchase the equity investment in unwired planet inc in fiscal  cash provided by investing activities resulted principally due to proceeds from the sale of the company s equity investment in unwired planet inc  and the company s former headquarters facility of  and  respectively  offset principally by capital expenditures 
in fiscal  cash provided by investing activities resulted principally from net maturities of short term investments of  cash provided by used in financing activities was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the cash from financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the issuance of approximately  in common stock in connection with the company s initial public offering and proceeds of approximately  on the company s construction loan on its new head quarters facility 
in fiscal  cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from the payoff of the company s construction note  partially offset by proceeds received on the company s new long term promissory note and the issuance of common stock resulting from stock options exercised 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from proceeds received from the issuance of common stock due to stock options exercised 
as of march   the company had approximately  of long term debt  including current portion  outstanding relating to its headquarters building 
monthly payments are  including interest at  with the unpaid balance due january  in accordance with the loan agreement  the company has provided the lender an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of  in order to obtain the irrevocable standby letter of credit  the company has pledged a  us treasury note as collateral 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes current working capital and its million bank line of credit will be adequate to meet the company s future working capital  new product development and capital expenditure requirements at least through the end of fiscal management does not believe that inflation has historically had a material effect on the company s results of operations 
many of the company s international contracts are denominated in local currencies  and an increase in the relative value of the dollar against such currencies would lead to a reduction in company revenues 
the company attempts to minimize its foreign currency exposure by attempting to keep intercompany balances current and minimizing assets in any one currency denomination 
however  due to recent losses  intercompany balances have increased and are not specifically hedged and there can be no assurance that the company s future results of operations will not be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales in the foreseeable future 
this dependence on international operations subjects the company to certain risks  including tariffs and other barriers  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  difficulty in managing distributors and resellers  difficulty in accounts receivable collection  foreign currency exposure and adverse tax consequences 
the company is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of protective import or export legislation and regulations by the united states or other countries 
the company cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be implemented on the company s products in the future 
there can be no assurance that these factors or the adoption of restrictive policies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the aicpa issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop provides guidance for determining whether computer software is internal use software and on accounting for the proceeds of computer software originally developed or obtained for internal use and then subsequently sold to the public 
it also provides guidance on capitalization of the losses incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company has not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this statement 
the disclosures prescribed by sop will be effective for the year ending march  consolidated financial statements 
year issues many currently installed computer systems and software products include coding to accept only two digit entries in the date code field instead of four digit entries and therefore cannot distinguish dates prior to january  from dates on or after january  systems and software that do not properly recognize such information may generate erroneous data or fail 
such systems need to be upgraded or replaced in order to function properly or  in other words  be year compliant 
significant uncertainty exists in the computer systems and software industry concerning the potential effects associated with non compliance 
microware has conducted year compliance reviews of current versions of its products 
the reviews include assessment  implementation  validation  testing and contingency planning 
microware believes that all of its most current product releases are year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that all of microware s customers will implement these compliant releases in a timely manner 
this could lead to failure of customer systems and product liability claims against microware 
while copies of old versions of microware s software may be embedded in deployed products  some of which may be used in mission critical functions  microware has made year compliant upgrades commercially available to all of its past licensees  and believes that the terms of its license agreements preclude any liability for year compliance related failures in such products 
however  even if microware products are year compliant  microware may be subject to claims based on year compliance issues in the products of other companies or issues arising from the integration of multiple products within a system 
the costs of defending and resolving year compliance related disputes  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on microware s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as part of its compliance program  microware has tested software obtained from third parties which has been integrated with microware products and in addition has sought assurances from respective third parties that their software is year compliant 
however  despite this testing by microware and assurances provided by third party suppliers  third party software may not be year compliant 
errors or defects in microware or third party products may result in loss of revenue  diversion of product development resources or other damage to microware which could have a material adverse effect on microware s business  financial condition and results of operations 
microware has initiated an assessment of its worldwide business systems  which include  product development  sales and marketing  finance  human resources and order fulfillment systems 
microware is working with and monitoring critical suppliers to determine that their products and or services are year compliant 
microware believes the software and hardware it uses internally is presently year compliant and is not aware of any material operational issues or costs that will be incurred in the future 
however  microware provides no assurance that it will not incur materially adverse consequences caused by undetected year compliant errors or defects in its business systems 
all costs associated with microware s year compliance are expensed as incurred and have not been accounted for separately 
these costs to date have not been material 
additional costs related to year compliance are not expected to be material 
microware is currently developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of its year compliance efforts 
depending on the system in question  these plans could include accelerated replacement of affected equipment  increased work hours for company personnel or use of contract personnel or possible manual workarounds  in addition to other similar approaches 
if microware is required to implement contingency plans  it could have a materially adverse effect on microware s business  financial condition and results of operations 
microware s ability to achieve year compliance  in all areas of its business  could be adversely effected by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  vendors or suppliers ability to modify proprietary software and other unanticipated problems identified in year compliance reviews and assessments 
such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on microware s business  financial condition and results of operations 
euro issues on january   the european union eu introduced a new currency the euro 
the euro is intended to enable the eu to blend the economies of the eu s member states into one large market with unrestricted and unencumbered trade and commerce across borders 
eleven european countries are participating in the first membership wave  namely the netherlands  belgium  luxembourg  germany  france  ireland  finland  austria  italy  spain and portugal 
other member states are expected to join in the years to come 
legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january and january during the transition period  non cash payments can be made in the euro  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
the company does not presently expect that the introduction and use of the euro will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows during the transition period 
the significant requirement of companies during the transitionary period is the ability to invoice and accept payment in euro denominated transactions if a customer makes this request 
the company will continue to evaluate issues involving the introduction of the euro 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity microware s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations as all financial assets are short term in nature 
the company is exposed to changes in fair values of its long term debt that carries a fixed interest rate 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  microware had total long term debt of  at march  foreign currency risk microware transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily japanese yen and certain european currencies  as discussed in item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and accordingly is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency markets 
the company does not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions
