the ips program rates were announced april   but given effect retroactively to october  in response to the implementation of ips  the company initiated a series of cost reduction programs  care delivery process improvements  and revenue growth actions 
see forward looking information below for a discussion of the possible impact of these regulatory matters on expected results 
revenue decreased and for fiscal and  respectively  principally due to reductions of medicare patient visits and corporate costs that were implemented to minimize the impact of new per beneficiary limits and tightened per visit limits imposed by the medicare ips 
the decline in revenue was offset in part by million recorded as revenue in the second quarter because the company received final settlements on several reimbursement issues with hcfa 
fiscal revenue included a million increase in revenue due to resolution of several reimbursement issues with hcfa and million decrease as a result of the impact of the per beneficiary limits 
medicare reserves of million were recorded in fiscal  principally relating to various decisions received from the medicare fiscal intermediary  the provider reimbursement review board and the us district court 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion of the medicare cost reimbursement disputes 
the breakdown by service of the company s total revenue is as follows year ended september visits extended hours hospice infusion extended hours revenue decreased and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decreases resulted principally from a reduction in the volume of new low margin cases accepted and a lack of staffing for certain service offerings in several markets 
visit revenue declined and in fiscal and  respectively  primarily due to decreases of and  respectively  in patient visits and corporate cost reductions implemented in an effort to minimize the impact of ips 
infusion revenue decreased and in fiscal and  respectively  primarily due to a reduction of infusion product offerings in a number of markets and the closure of ten pharmacies as part of the company s restructuring plan during fiscal hospice revenue increased and in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of increased overall patient census 
direct costs  as a percent of revenue  were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the high percent in fiscal resulted principally from increases to medicare reserves that were recorded as reductions in revenue 
direct costs  as a percent of revenue before medicare reserves  were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the rate increase in fiscal was due primarily to the decrease in revenue as a result of the per beneficiary limits enacted that year 
the rate decrease in fiscal is due primarily to care delivery process improvements initiated as a result of ips 
general  administrative and selling expenses as a percent of revenue were in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the reduction in revenue attributable to increases in the medicare reserves strongly impacted the general  administrative and selling expenses as a percent of revenue in fiscal general  administrative and selling expenses as a percent of revenue before medicare reserves  were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the percent for fiscal and is principally attributable to cost controls implemented by management in response to ips 
during fiscal  the company recorded a  restructuring charge as a result of the implementation of a plan to restructure its field operations and reduce its cost structure in an effort to improve earnings 
the charge included  of costs associated with lease costs and related equipment write offs due to the closing of eight pharmacies  the consolidation of seven sites in multi site markets and the relocation of eight other sites to more economical locations 
the charge also included  of severance costs related to administrative staff reductions which were included in general  administrative and selling expenses and completed in fiscal total expenditures related to facilities consolidation were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company reduced the restructuring liability through general  administrative and selling expenses by  and  in fiscal and  respectively  which were primarily lease costs and equipment write offs primarily due to the timing of certain events differing from the original plan 
as of september   the restructuring is complete 
net interest income for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
interest income is principally derived from earnings on cash and cash equivalents 
the increases in net interest income in fiscal and was due to increases in cash equivalents generated by operating activities 
income tax expense of  and  for fiscal and  respectively  have been offset by net operating loss carryforwards generated in fiscal income tax benefit was of the loss before tax in fiscal the fiscal tax rate was impacted by a valuation allowance against the company s net operating loss carryforward and certain other deferred tax assets 
income loss applicable to common shareholders was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the significant loss in fiscal was principally attributable to an increase of  in medicare reserves resulting from unfavorable decisions received in fiscal from the medicare fiscal intermediary  the provider reimbursement review board and the us district court relating to prior period cost reports 
the restructuring charge of  also contributed to the loss in fiscal liquidity capital resources during fiscal the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  at september  in october the company repaid medicare  as discussed below 
approximately  and of revenue for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively  was derived from services provided to medicare beneficiaries for which payment is based on cost 
payments for these services are made by the medicare program based on reimbursable costs incurred in rendering services 
medicare makes interim payments as services are rendered and the company files cost reports on an annual basis  which are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by medicare 
the company reports revenue only for those costs that it believes are probable as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
of recovery under the applicable medicare statutes and regulations and reports related accounts receivable balances at net realizable value 
over the years  medicare auditors employed by the medicare fiscal intermediaries have  in connection with their retrospective audit process  taken certain positions with respect to certain types of costs  claiming that such costs are not reimbursable and thus not recoverable by the company under the medicare program 
when the company disagrees with findings of the medicare fiscal intermediaries  it seeks relief through administrative and legal channels 
based on a detailed analysis of statutes and regulations  administrative and judicial decisions  and consultation with independent industry experts and legal counsel  the company provides a reserve by means of a revenue deduction for any costs incurred which are not probable of recovery 
at september   total disputed costs were  the company believes that recovery of  of such costs including extrapolation for all unsettled cost reporting periods may not be probable and  accordingly  has established reserves totaling  at september  at september   disputed costs totaling  were not reserved 
of these costs   relates to the compensation of physical therapists employed by the company 
the medicare intermediary has taken the position that contractor physical therapist salary equivalency guidelines should be applied to the company s employee physical therapists  and thus disallowed certain physical therapy costs for the fiscal cost reporting period 
the company appealed to the provider reimbursement review board prrb and received a favorable ruling in february in april  the health care financing administration hcfa reversed the prrb ruling and disallowed all of the disputed costs 
the company appealed to the us federal district court district court in minneapolis  which in march set aside hcfa s decision  finding it arbitrary and capricious because hcfa provided an insufficient explanation for their decision 
in october  hcfa issued a decision purporting to clarify their previous decision  and disallowed all disputed costs 
the company appealed to the district court  and in june the district court again ruled in favor of the company  declaring hcfa s decision contrary to law and set it aside 
in august  hcfa appealed the decision to the eighth circuit court of appeals 
on september   the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit issued a favorable decision for the company 
the secretary s time in which to appeal expired november  on december   the assistant us attorney in minneapolis informed the company that the secretary has not appealed the decision of the court of appeals 
 of unreserved disputed costs involves the company s home office costs as they relate to the pharmacy operations in the company s branch offices 
the company s fiscal intermediary has adopted an allocation method of the company s home office costs that the company believes is in violation of a written agreement between the company and its fiscal intermediary 
the company believes that it will prevail in this case 
 of unreserved disputed costs involves the company s skilled nursing costs 
the company s fiscal intermediary has allocated such costs to all services of the company in spite of the fact that the activities of the company s skilled nursing staff are attributable to the company s visits services 
the company believes that it will prevail in this case 
 of unreserved disputed costs involves the company s payments for services from manor care  inc manor care 
beginning in fiscal  the company made payments to manor care in return for services performed on behalf of the company 
to ensure that the expenses incurred by manor care were not submitted to medicare on both the company s and on manor care s cost reports  the company s fiscal intermediary requested documentation that the amounts were removed from manor care s cost report 
the company is working with manor care to provide such documentation 
the company believes that it will prevail in this case 
 of unreserved disputed costs involves the costs of certain administrative clerical personnel 
the company s fiscal intermediary has allocated such costs across all services of the company in spite of the fact that they are incurred primarily in the visits services due to the relatively high need for documentation and filing in the visits services 
the company believes that it will prevail in this case 
at september   total accounts receivable net of reserves due from medicare were  based on the progress toward resolution of the disputed costs  management estimates that net receivables of  will not be realized within the next twelve months  and accordingly  has classified net receivables of  as a non current asset 
accrued liabilities to third party of  at september  represent payments from medicare in excess of amounts that the company will be entitled to upon ultimate settlement of medicare cost reports 
in october  the company repaid  to medicare which was included in the accrued liabilities to third party 
operating activities provided  in cash during fiscal   in cash during fiscal and used  in cash during fiscal included in the cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  of progress payments received from third parties in excess of costs incurred 
this entire amount was repaid in november  which affected fiscal operating cash flows 
additionally  fiscal cash provided by operating activities included  of income tax refunds in connection with a net operating loss carryback of the fiscal net operating loss 
total accounts receivable current and long term increased in fiscal and decreased and during fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in total accounts receivable during fiscal was due to the increase in long term accounts receivable resulting from the increase of disputed costs as discussed above 
the decrease in accounts receivable during fiscal was due to the decreases in related revenue 
the decrease during fiscal was due primarily to the additions to the medicare reserve of  investing activities used  in fiscal and provided  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal were primarily computer upgrades 
the company paid manor care cash dividends of  in fiscal  and additionally  during fiscal  and  the company made principal payments on long term debt of   and  respectively 
the company has unused letter of credit facilities for  the letters of credit are collateralized by secured investments and will expire in december the redeemable convertible preferred stock issued to manor care includes  shares that may be redeemed at the option of manor care or the company at  face value on or after october  and  shares with a face value of  that may only be redeemed at the option of the company 
management has performed preliminary evaluations on a number of financing alternatives in the event manor care elects to redeem the  of preferred stock 
management believes that cash provided from operations along with existing cash balances will be sufficient to finance the company s operations through october   and long term financing alternatives will be available to meet the company s future needs  however there are no assurances such long term financing will ultimately be obtained 
year the company has assessed and continues to assess the potential impact of the year issue affecting most corporations  primarily concerning the ability of information systems to properly recognize and process information relating to the year and beyond 
the company believes it is substantially year compliant 
the company began addressing the year issue in fiscal  primarily in the business systems area  such as general ledger  payroll  and accounts payable 
other systems  such as the internally developed business operations systems  phone systems  and wide area network were modified or replaced during fiscal and fiscal costs of modification replacement included  of expense and  of capital assets and did not have a material impact on the company s financial performance 
principal risk areas for the company would be the potential inability to bill its principal third party payer  medicare  for services rendered to patients  or the inability of the third party payer s systems to recognize the billing data  delaying payment for services rendered 
hcfa  which administers medicare payments  reported it has renovated  tested  and certified all of its critical internal systems as of december  the critical external systems operated by private insurance companies that contract with hcfa have also been certified as compliant by march  the company is not aware of any significant exposure due to its own systems or the systems of third parties  however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of third parties on which the company relies will be compliant in a timely manner  or that such failure would not have a material adverse impact on the company 
forward looking information statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the letter to shareholders  elsewhere in the annual report  in the company s form k  in future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission  in the company s press releases and in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer which are not historical or current facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected 
the company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
the factors discussed below  among others  could affect the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual financial performance to differ materially from that expressed in any forward looking statement 
the majority of the company s revenue is derived from services provided to medicare beneficiaries 
currently  medicare reimburses participating medicare certified home health agencies for the reasonable costs incurred to provide covered visits to eligible beneficiaries  subject to certain cost limits which vary according to geographic regions of the country 
this does not allow the company to generate a profit from these services 
in fact  due to certain limitations on the nature and amount of the costs that are reimbursable  the company incurs a loss on the medicare business 
together  the balanced budget act of the budget act and the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for fiscal year the appropriations act require hcfa to implement a prospective payment system pps for home health agencies by october  the budget act and appropriations act provide that if the department of health and human services hhs fails to implement a pps by october   the per visit and per beneficiary cost limits will be reduced an additional on that date 
the appropriations act further delayed the limit reduction to october the impact of such a change  if implemented  on the company s results of operations cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and would depend  to a large extent  on the reimbursement rates for home nursing established on an interim basis and under the prospective payment system 
there can be no assurances that such reimbursement rates  if enacted  would cover the costs incurred by the company to provide home nursing services 
until prospective payment takes effect on october   the budget act sets up an interim payment system ips that provides for lowering of reimbursement limits for home health visits 
for fiscal and  home health agencies cost limits will be determined as the lesser of i actual  reasonable costs  ii per visit cost limits based on of median costs of freestanding home health agencies or iii agency specific per beneficiary cost limits  based on of costs  adjusted for inflation 
the new cost limits were announced april   effective retroactively to october  the new limits  together with the per visit limits  caused a million reduction to the company s revenue 
the company initiated a series of cost reduction programs  care delivery process improvements  and revenue growth actions and had only a  reduction in fiscal revenue due to these limits 
in response to industry and patient protest as to the severity of cuts in payments resulting from the interim payments  congress enacted change in the payments 
effective october   the appropriations act includes revisions to the medicare ips for home health agencies 
the appropriations act responds to widespread concerns about inadequate payments to home health agencies under ips by modifying per beneficiary limits 
specifically  for providers with a month cost reporting period ending in fiscal  each home health agency below the national median per beneficiary limit will have its limit increased by one third of the difference between its limit and the national median 
payments to agencies without a month cost reporting period ending in fiscal  but for which the first cost reporting period begins in fiscal  will be increased by two percent 
in addition  the appropriations act increases the per visit limit from to of the national median cost 
while the company expects to be able to operate under the new limits  based on the recent changes  there can be no assurances these are the final rates 
during fiscal  several cost reimbursement issues that were in dispute for several years were resolved through decisions by the prrb and the us district court 
as a result of these decisions and other communications from hcfa  it became clear that some costs incurred by the company would not be reimbursed by medicare 
although the company has restructured its operations and eliminated a portion of these nonreimbursable costs  the company will continue to incur some costs that are not reimbursed by medicare  as it believes they constitute a necessary function to the conduct of its business 
in may  the clinton administration instituted operation restore trust ort  a health care fraud and abuse initiative focusing on nursing homes  home health care agencies and durable medical equipment companies located in the five states with the largest medicare populations 
ort has been responsible for millions of dollars in civil and criminal restitution  fines  recovery of overpayments and the exclusion of a number of individuals and corporations from the medicare program 
ort has been expanded to all fifty states 
private insurers and various state enforcement agencies also have increased their scrutiny of health care providers practices and claims  particularly in the home health and durable medical equipment areas 
additionally  hcfa has implemented wedge surveys in at least states 
in these surveys  hcfa completes ort type surveys on a much smaller scale 
generally  hcfa extrapolates the percentage which was paid in error to all claims paid for the period under review 
assuming the reviewer uncovered nothing significant  the home health agency then has the option to repay the amount determined by hcfa or undergo a broader review of its claims 
if the survey uncovers significant problems  the matter may be referred for further review 
while the company believes that it is in material compliance with the fraud and abuse laws  there can be no assurance that the practices of the company  if reviewed  would be found to be in full compliance with such requirements  as such requirements ultimately may be interpreted 
it is the company s policy to monitor its compliance with such requirements and to take appropriate actions to attempt to ensure such compliance 
although the company does not believe it has violated any fraud and abuse laws  there can be no assurance that future related legislation  either health care or budgetary  related regulatory changes or interpretations of such regulations  will not have a material adverse effect on the future operations of the company 
the company is also affected by settlements which may be reached with hhs regarding cost reports and its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with referral sources  including payers  hospitals  physicians and other health care professionals 
as a result of these developments  the company is not able to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate future earnings which will allow it to utilize its nols and  accordingly  has established a valuation allowance against the nols 
at september   the company had federal operating loss carryforwards of  which will expire in and management believes it is more likely than not that certain of these net operating loss carryforwards may expire unused and  accordingly  has established a valuation allowance against them
