during fiscal  the company s domestic sales of air conditioners continued to reflect an increasingly seasonal pattern  with more shipments occurring in the second half of the fiscal year and fewer in the off season first half since leading retailers require just in time delivery 
the company s ability to supply products to leading retailers with accurate response  in season production capabilities enables it to maintain a strong market leadership position 
favorable summer weather in fiscal increased in season sales and depleted industry inventories at fiscal year end august  which positions us manufacturers for another strong year in fiscal  assuming normal weather

year this discussion is separated into two sections  one with respect to all of fedders corporation  excluding trion  and the second with respect to trion solely for purposes of clarity since the acquisition occurred in august for fedders corporation  the inventory  assessment  resolution  and testing phases of the year plan are materially complete with respect to internal information technology it and non it systems  such as embedded technology and micro controllers 
the national retail federation has listed the company as being a compliant year edi vendor 
the principle year uncertainty relates to third party relationships with customers and suppliers 
assessment of these relationships  in part through on site audits  is ongoing and contingency plans have been developed to minimize the effect of any such issues 
contingency planning includes the use of alternate suppliers  which the company has in place for virtually all significant components 
in addition  the company is developing plans to protect its facilities from any damage that could occur if a utility supplying that facility was unable to provide service 
because the company s business is seasonal  and most customers in the domestic market do not take product until close to the summer season  the company will have a period of time to react to any adverse consequences caused by a vendor or service provider who is not year compliant 
the company cannot estimate lost revenues  if any  at this time that are reasonably likely to be a result of year issues 
immediately following the completion of its tender offer for trion  the company incorporated trion s year program into its own year plan 
the inventory and assessment phases of trion s year efforts are materially complete 
trion has remediated a majority of its it and non it systems  however  a number of such systems are scheduled for completion and testing in november the company will be actively engaged in seeing that the planned completion of all plan phases occurs on a timely basis 
as to third party relationships with customers and suppliers  these will be monitored on an ongoing basis 
alternate suppliers have been identified and are also being assessed 
trion cannot estimate lost revenues  if any  at this time that are reasonably likely to be a result of year issues 
the company has not delayed any it projects that are material to its operations due to year efforts  nor does it believe that any delay in implementation of these projects will have any material financial impact
