item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations income statement comparison the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income tax net income loss analysis of compared to revenues the company s net sales decreased by to  during from  in the decline resulted from strategic decisions to eliminate low margin items from the company s product lines  reduced sales to the western apparel and crafts markets  and lower export sales 
sales of lower margin items were down from and now represent less than of total revenues 
nearly half of the company s business is made up of sales to western apparel and crafts markets  and sales in these markets were down and  respectively  compared to  reflecting a continuation of negative industry trends 
however  sales in the company s core businesses and institutional markets remained strong throughout the year and registered an increase in revenues over sales of the company s products do not reflect significant seasonal patterns 
costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was for as compared to for the difference in the relative cost of sales percentage was principally attributable to an improved product sales mix and the company s strategic efforts to selectively raise prices and eliminate lower margin items from its product lines 
a lower relative cost of sales percentage meant that gross profit as a percentage of sales was higher for the fiscal year ended december  compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales increased percentage points to in from in operating expenses decreased  or to  in from  in approximately half of the decrease in operating expenses was the result of lower payroll costs  reflecting an additional reduction of personnel during other decreases included lower advertising costs  reduced accounting  legal and professional fees  and lower freight costs 
other income expense other expenses were  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to  during the same period in interest expense was up  in as the amortization of deferred costs from the november debt refinancing offset reduced interest expense due to lower borrowing levels during the year 
other income increased  relative to due to a gain from the sale of a trademark in as opposed to a loss recorded on the sale of real estate in tampa  florida in provision benefit for income taxes the benefit for income taxes was of the loss before taxes in the tax benefit reflects a deduction for a contribution to the company s esop for tax purposes in excess of its treatment in arriving at net income 
this amount is partly offset by certain non deductible expenses totaling  principally comprised of the amortization of goodwill 
taking these two amounts into account  the company s effective tax rate materially approximates the company s historical rate for combined federal and state income taxes of about net income loss the company recorded a net loss of  for as compared to net income of  for the change in results was primarily due to the factors noted above regarding sales  cost of goods sold  operating expenses and other income expense 
analysis of compared to revenues the company s net sales decreased by to  during from  in this sales decline was a result of the negative forces at the retail level that existed in some of the company s markets as well as the company s plan to achieve greater margins through higher prices which led to a lower volume of sales 
the company experienced reduced revenues of  in sales of western or southwestern related products and reductions of  in sales to the retail craft industry 
in addition to sales declines due to negative market forces in the craft and western apparel industries  the company initiated and implemented certain strategies during the year that resulted in lower sales 
prices in lower margin product lines were selectively increased and certain products were eliminated from these lines 
these merchandising and pricing strategies contributed to the sales decline by approximately  this decline was partially offset by increases generated in the company s growing line of finished leather accessories and an increase in export sales 
costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was for as compared to for the difference in the relative cost of sales percentage was principally attributable to i a change in sales mix  in that the percentage of the company s sales reflecting relative lower costs of sales increased  ii management s plan to raise prices and selectively eliminate lower margin items from the company s product lines  and iii direct labor costs that were eliminated due to planned personnel reductions and the settlement of the labor dispute at cushman in october of a lower relative cost of sales percentage meant that gross profit as a percentage of sales was higher for the fiscal year ended december  compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales increased percentage points to in from in due to the factors mentioned above relative to cost of sales  the company generated almost the same amount of gross profit in dollars on  in sales during the fiscal year ended december  as it did on  in sales during operating expenses decreased  or to  during from  in this decrease in operating expenses was the net result of cost control measures instituted by management 
the reductions in operating expenses involved several factors  including i reduced payroll  payroll tax and payroll related expenses of approximately  due to a substantially lower average number of employees during compared to  ii a small bad debt recovery recorded during as opposed to  of expense for  iii a net reduction in commission expense of  in  due primarily to the elimination of sales representatives in the retail craft market  iv  less amortization expense in  principally because of the write down of certain purchased goodwill during  and iv reductions of  or more in each of advertising  corporate fees and shareholders relations  freight  insurance  supplies  travel  and marketing samples 
these decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased professional expenses incurred by the company in initial efforts to obtain new financing during other income expense other expenses were  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to  during the same period in the difference between the two years involved decreased interest expense 
the difference in the dollar amount of interest expense was principally due to the write off in of the commitment and facility fees attributable to the acquisition commitments that expired in july the interest expense that the company could have saved during from decreased levels of debt compared to the previous year  was offset by increased interest rates and the forbearance fees charged by nationsbank 
due to the company s continuing default under certain covenants contained in its former nationsbank debt facility  the rate of interest charged by nationsbank increased from an average of the prime rate or less during the prior fiscal year to the prime rate plus on average for provision benefit for income taxes the provision for federal and state income taxes was of income before taxes due to certain non deductible expenses totaling  principally comprised of the amortization of goodwill 
taking this into account the company s effective tax rate materially approximates the company s historical rate for combined federal and state income taxes of about 
net income loss the company recorded net income of  for as compared to a net loss of  during the change in results was primarily due to the factors noted above regarding sales  cost of goods sold  operating expenses and other income expense 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources during were borrowings from the senior debt facility with finova  the subordinated debenture held by schlinger  and cash flows provided by operating activities 
while having a negative impact on sales  the company s continued focus in on improving gross profit margins and reducing operating expenses was effective as indicated by the cash flow from operations in the amount of  the use of cash flows from operations to pay down debt is reflected in the improvement of the company s debt to equity ratio from at december  to at december  some of this cash flow resulted from the company s ability to reduce its investment in accounts receivable and inventory given the reduced level of sales 
accounts receivable decreased to  and inventory decreased to  at december  from  and  respectively  at december  the aging of accounts receivable has not deteriorated and is indicative of management s continued tight credit and collection policies which have also contributed to the negative trend in sales noted above 
even at the reduced level  inventory only turned times during  which is below the ratio of times 
this decrease in the turn rate indicates that further reductions in inventory are still needed as of december  to support the current level of sales 
management anticipates the completion of its implementation of new information systems in will assist in monitoring of inventory levels that in turn should provide additional cash flows from operations in the future 
the refinancing of the company s debt on a long term basis as discussed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements significantly improved the company s financial position 
the company s current ratio was at december  and at december  compared to at the end of if the company s promissory notes and debentures had not been reclassified from long term to current to reflect their maturity during  the current ratio at december  would have been 
the largest use of cash beyond inventory  accounts receivable  and debt payments in was for capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately of capital spending was for new computer equipment and software with the remainder split between office and warehouse fixtures  machinery and other equipment  and leasehold improvements 
the company believes that the current sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to fund current operations and the opening of new sales distribution units 
in  the funding for the opening of new units is expected to be provided by operating leases  cash flows from operating activities  the company s senior debt facility with finova  and the subordinated debenture with schlinger 
the senior debt facility is comprised of a revolving credit facility and three term notes 
the revolving portion is based upon the level of the company s accounts receivable and inventory 
at december   the company had additional availability of approximately  as the company s sales and operations expand  requiring larger investments in accounts receivable and inventory  the company expects to have in excess of  in additional funds available under the revolving credit facility 
the company s senior debt facility and subordinated debentures mature on december   and management intends to pursue negotiations with finova and other potential investors lenders in to extend or replace the maturing debt facilities 
management believes it will be able to secure the required financing prior to the maturity of these obligations 
however  in the event of a future material adverse change in the company s operations  finova could accelerate its debt or otherwise determine not to renew the notes 
in such a circumstance the company would pursue other sources of financing 
if other financing could not be secured  the company could experience a material adverse impact 
management perceives opportunities to acquire related business in the marketplace due to the fragmented nature of the markets in which the company conducts business as well as due to the competitive conditions of these markets 
the company s present financing arrangements will not be sufficient to make these acquisitions and if any acquisitions are to be consummated  the company will be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
any new financings will require the consent of finova 
the company can provide no assurance that these acquisitions can be made on terms acceptable to the company or that the needed financings to enter into these transactions can be obtained 
year issue the year yk problem arose because many computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
as a consequence  unless modified  many computer systems will interpret as rather than the year this issue is believed to affect virtually all organizations and failure to address the problem could result in system failures and the generation of erroneous data 
each company s potential costs and uncertainties will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to its software  hardware  the nature of its industry  and the sophistication of its manufacturing and process control systems 
the company has developed a comprehensive yk readiness plan to ensure its systems will be yk compliant prior to the year pursuant to this plan  the company conducted preliminary reviews of its critical information technology it systems as well as its non it systems 
the majority of systems that were found to be defective in this review have been replaced or upgraded with the exception of the company s point of sale pos software used for invoicing and inventory maintenance in the company s texas locations 
the installation of the pos system in the company s remaining nineteen distribution units was delayed until after the conversion and testing of the yk compliant version of the software 
the conversion in the fort worth location is currently in process and all texas locations should be on the yk compliant version by the end of march installation in the remaining locations is scheduled to be completed by october  the company has appointed a yk committee composed of senior executives and middle management 
this committee is charged with testing systems for potential yk problems missed in the preliminary review and remediation process as well as assessment of potential risks from the company s trading partners yk failures 
this committee will report periodically to the company s board of directors and currently expects testing to be completed by october  the company has managed its yk compliance program using mostly internal salaried staff 
for this reason and the fact that much of the replacement cost of non compliant it systems would have been incurred anyway  it is difficult to quantify the actual remediation costs 
the company spent  in for new computer systems and acquired an additional  in new equipment and software in january this investment includes systems upgrades which will facilitate completion of the yk compliance program 
it is believed that the majority of the total expected remediation costs have already been incurred 
the company believes because of the nature of its operations and the steps taken as discussed above that the yk issue will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
actual results may differ from the forward looking statements contained in this discussion and there can be no guarantee that the failure of certain systems will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
in the unlikely event that unforeseen yk problems are not remedied prior to a disruption in normal business operations  the company would in most instances be able to temporarily revert to manual processes that the company successfully used prior to automating many routine tasks 
cautionary statement the disclosures under results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  year issue and in the notes to consolidated financial statements as provided elsewhere herein contain forward looking statements and projections of management 
there are certain important factors which could cause results to differ materially than those anticipated by some of the forward looking statements 
some  but not all  of the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include  among other things  changes from anticipated levels of sales  whether due to future national or regional economic and competitive conditions  including  but not limited to  retail craft buying patterns  and possible negative trends in the craft and western retail markets  customer acceptance of existing and new products  or otherwise  pricing pressures due to competitive industry conditions  increases in prices for leather  which is a world wide commodity  which for some reason  may not be passed on to the customers of the company s products  change in tax rates  change in interest rates  change in the commercial banking environment  the company s or its significant trading partners inability to identify all yk issues  problems with the importation of the products which the company buys in countries around the world  including  but not limited to  transportation problems or changes in the political climate of the countries involved  including the maintenance by said countries of most favored nation status with the united states of america  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the compnay s senior debt facility includes loans with interest rates that vary with changes in the prime rate 
an increase of one percentage point in the prime rate would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings
