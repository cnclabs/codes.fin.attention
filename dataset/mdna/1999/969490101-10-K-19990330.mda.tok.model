item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the company s historical consolidated financial position at december   and results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december  the company s historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
overview prior to  the company and its predecessors concentrated their drilling activities in the trend 
oil and gas production in the trend is generally characterized by a high initial production rate  followed by a steep rate of decline 
in order to maintain its oil and gas reserve base  production levels and cash flow from operations  the company has been required to maintain or increase its level of drilling activity and achieve comparable or improved results from such activities 
in response to low oil prices  the company suspended its trend drilling activities in april and has no plans to resume drilling in that area until oil prices improve and stabilize 
beginning in  the company initiated several exploratory projects designed to reduce its dependence on trend drilling for future production and reserve growth 
these new areas include other formations in the vicinity of its core properties in east central texas  as well as south texas  louisiana and mississippi  and emphasize the development of long life gas reserves 
during  the company devoted a substantial portion of its capital expenditures to these new areas 
of the gross net exploratory wells drilled in  the company successfully completed gross net exploratory wells in areas outside the trend  and in addition  completed gross net exploratory well in january in the aggregate  these discoveries accounted for about of the company s  mboe of proved reserves added during the most significant discovery was the j 
c 
fazzino unit  a cotton valley pinnacle reef gas well in robertson county  texas in which the company owns a working interest 
the company s net proved reserves on this well are estimated to be bcf of gas  mboe 
the company is presently constructing a gas pipeline and treatment facility in order to market these gas reserves 
prior to first sales  which are planned for may  the company will stimulate the well in an attempt to improve initial flow rates 
the company also plans to drill an offset well to the j 
c 
fazzino during see liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties  whereby costs of productive wells  developmental dry holes and productive leases are capitalized and amortized using the unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
costs of unproved properties are initially capitalized 
those properties with significant acquisition costs are periodically assessed and any impairment in value is charged to expense 
the amount of impairment recognized on unproved properties which are not individually significant is determined by amortizing the costs of such properties within appropriate groups based on the company s historical experience  acquisition dates and average lease terms 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs  including the cost of stratigraphic test wells  are initially capitalized but charged to expense if and when the well is determined to be unsuccessful

includes effects of hedging transactions 
excludes wells being drilled or completed at the end of each period 
compared to revenues oil and gas sales decreased from million in to million in due primarily to lower oil prices 
the company s average oil price during the current period declined after giving effect to a per barrel gain on hedging activities 
excluding hedging transactions  the company s average price per barrel of oil declined from in to in although oil production for decreased as compared to  several factors related to the current depressed levels of oil prices had a negative impact on production 
in april  the company suspended its trend drilling program until oil prices improve and stabilize 
the company also implemented an oil curtailment strategy during which resulted in a decrease of approximately  barrels of oil production during the year 
all of the company s gas discoveries in were either completed late in the year or are currently waiting on pipeline connections 
accordingly  production from new wells has not been sufficient to offset the recent decline in oil production attributable to the suspension of trend drilling 
furthermore  until these wells and other exploratory projects establish and sustain commercial levels of production  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to offset the decline in production 
costs and expenses lease operations expenses decreased from million in to million in due primarily to lower production taxes resulting from a significant decline in oil prices 
oil and gas production on a boe basis decreased during the current period  causing a decrease in lease operations expenses on a boe basis from per boe in to per boe in exploration costs doubled from million in to million in due primarily to the charge off of gross net exploratory dry holes during the period totaling million and million of unproved property impairments 
these charges were offset in part by a million reduction in seismic costs from to because the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected during any accounting period in which seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved property impairments are expensed 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to a increase in the company s average depletion rate per boe attributable to the effects of lower oil and gas prices on estimated quantities of proved reserves 
this increase in the average depletion rate was substantially offset by an decline in oil and gas production on a boe basis 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on a unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the average depletion rate per boe was in compared to in general and administrative g a expenses were relatively constant from to however  beginning in december  the company implemented certain cost reduction measures  consisting primarily of personnel layoffs and salary reductions  in order to reduce overhead and conserve financial resources 
through these efforts  the company expects to reduce g a expenses in by approximately on an annualized basis 
the company recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of million during the fourth quarter of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets sfas  as compared to a  provision in the provision applied to certain oil and gas properties in east central texas  south texas  the texas gulf coast  louisiana  and mississippi and was caused primarily by a decline in forecasted oil and gas prices 
interest expense and other interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher average levels of indebtedness on the company s secured bank credit facility the credit facility  offset in part by an increase in capitalized interest and slightly lower average interest rates 
the average daily principal balance outstanding on such facility during was million compared to million in the effective annual interest rate on bank debt  including bank fees  during the period was compared to in capitalized interest was  higher during the period due to a significant increase in unproved acreage 
compared to revenues oil and gas sales increased from million in to million in due primarily to a increase in oil production 
the effect of higher oil production was partially offset by a decrease in oil prices and a decline in gas production 
production from wells completed subsequent to december  accounted for approximately of total oil production for the period  which more than offset the effects of steep production declines from previously existing trend wells 
the company plans to discontinue trend drilling in april pending an improvement in oil prices  which have fallen to their lowest levels in four years 
the suspension of trend drilling activities for an extended period of time may adversely affect the company s production and revenues in costs and expenses lease operations expenses increased from million in to million in while oil and gas production on a boe basis increased  resulting in a decrease in lease operations expenses on a boe basis from per boe in to per boe in higher initial rates of production on several of the wells completed during contributed materially to the decline in lease operations expenses per boe 
exploration costs increased from million in to million in due primarily to costs incurred during in connection with exploration projects initiated during the fourth quarter of the company plans to spend approximately million in on exploratory prospects 
because the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected during any accounting period in which seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved property impairments are expensed 
dd a expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to a increase in oil and gas production on a boe basis  combined with an increase in the company s average depletion rate per boe 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on a unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the average depletion rate per boe was in the period compared to in the period 
g a expenses increased from million in to million in due primarily to increased personnel costs 
in response to an increase in demand for skilled technical and managerial personnel in the oil and gas industry and an increase in the company s level of exploration and development activities  the company has hired additional personnel and increased salaries of existing personnel 
interest expense interest expense decreased from million in to million in due primarily to lower average levels of indebtedness on the credit facility and  to a much lesser extent  lower average interest rates 
the average daily principal balance outstanding on such facility during the period was million compared to million in the effective annual interest rate on bank debt  including bank fees  during the period was compared to in liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary financial resource is its oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with the terms of the credit facility  the banks establish a borrowing base  as derived from the estimated value of the company s oil and gas properties  against which the company may borrow funds as needed to supplement its internally generated cash flow as a source of financing for its capital expenditure program 
product prices  over which the company has very limited control  have a significant impact on such estimated value and thereby on the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility 
within the confines of product pricing  the company must be able to find and develop or acquire oil and gas reserves in a cost effective manner in order to generate sufficient financial resources through internal means to complete the financing of its capital expenditure program 
the following discussion sets forth the company s current plans for capital expenditures in  and the expected capital resources needed to finance such plans 
capital expenditures at present time  the company plans to spend only million on exploration and development activities during  substantially all of which is projected to be spent on the cotton valley exploratory project in the north giddings block 
in january  the company completed the j 
c 
fazzino unit  a cotton valley pinnacle reef well in robertson county  texas drilled into one of several reef anomalies identified by a d seismic survey conducted in the company is currently constructing a gas pipeline and treatment facility for the well and plans to acidize the well prior to first production 
in the aggregate  the company expects to spend approximately million in to complete the well and facilities and to renew and extend leases in the north giddings block  as required 
in addition  the company plans to drill an offset well to the j 
c 
fazzino unit during utilizing a vendor financing program 
the company may increase its planned activities for if product prices improve and if the company is able to obtain the capital resources necessary to finance such activities 
see business drilling  exploration and production activities 
capital resources credit facility the credit facility provides for a revolving loan facility in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the borrowing base  as established by the banks  or that portion of the borrowing base determined by the company to be the elected borrowing limit 
at december   the borrowing base was million and the outstanding advances were million 
in january  the borrowing base was reduced to million to give effect to the sale of certain assets in matagorda county  texas 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination at any time  but at least semi annually  and is made at the discretion of the banks 
anticipating the adverse affects that low product prices could have on the borrowing base  the company initiated efforts late in to sell its interests in two properties in order to reduce the amount of outstanding indebtedness on the credit facility 
in january  the company completed the sale of its interest in eight non operated oil and gas wells located in matagorda county  texas for million 
in march  the company entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of its interests in the jalmat field located in lea county  new mexico for million 
the jalmat sale is scheduled to close in april in march  the banks completed a borrowing base review and elected to maintain the borrowing base at million until the company consummates the sale of its jalmat assets 
once the jalmat sale is completed  the borrowing base will reduce to million and will also be subject to monthly commitment reductions of  beginning in july the adjusted borrowing base will remain in effect until the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination in november however  if the jalmat sale does not occur by may   the banks will cause the borrowing base to be redetermined 
if the redetermined borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding indebtedness  the company will be required to i pledge additional collateral  ii prepay the excess in not more than five equal monthly installments  or iii elect to convert the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness to a term obligation based on amortization formulas set forth in the loan agreement 
working capital and cash flow during  the company generated cash flow from operating activities of million  borrowed million on the credit facility  and spent million on capital expenditures 
the company s working capital deficit increased from million at december  to million at december  the company classified million of its outstanding indebtedness on the credit facility as a current liability based on the required levels of repayments during the company also classified the net book value of properties sold or contracted for sale in as properties held for resale and  accordingly  reported million as a current asset at december  additional capital resources the company believes that the funds which will be available from the completed and pending sales of assets  combined with operating cash flow  will be adequate to fund the required reductions in indebtedness on the credit facility and the projected capital expenditures for however  because future cash flows and the availability of borrowings under the credit facility are subject to a number of variables  such as prevailing prices of oil and gas  actual production from existing and newly completed wells  the company s success in developing and producing new reserves  and the uncertainty with respect to the amount of funds which may ultimately be required to finance the company s exploration program  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to sustain the company s exploratory and development activities 
if funds available from asset sales  combined with operating cash flow  are not sufficient to fund its debt repayments and anticipated levels of capital expenditures  the company will be required to seek alternative forms of capital resources  including the sale of other assets and the issuance of debt or equity securities 
although the company believes it will be able to obtain funds pursuant to one or more of these alternatives  if needed  management cannot be assured that any such capital resources will be available to the company 
if additional capital resources are needed  but the company is unable to obtain such capital resources on a timely basis  the company may not be able to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to meet its obligations as they mature or maintain compliance with the required financial covenants contained in the credit facility 
inflation although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the level of inflation  inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations during information systems for the year historically  certain computer software systems  as well as certain hardware containing embedded chip technology  such as microcontrollers and microprocessors  were designed to utilize a two digit date field and consequently  they may not be able to properly recognize dates in the year this could result in system failures 
the company relies on its computer based management information systems  as well as embedded technology  to operate instruments and equipment in conducting its day to day business activities 
certain of these computer based programs and embedded technology may not have been designed to function properly with respect to the application of dating systems relating to the year in response  the company has developed a year plan and  in  established an internal group to identify and assess potential areas of risk and to make any required modifications to its computer systems and equipment used in oil and gas exploration  production  gathering and gas processing activities 
the year plan is comprised of various phases  including assessment  remediation  testing and contingency plan development 
the company believes this plan will provide reasonable assurance that its business activities and facilities will continue to operate safely and reliably  and without material interruption after the company has completed all phases of the year plan as it relates to its internal systems and hardware 
the company s inventory of computer hardware and software is substantially year compliant 
the programming modifications for the oil and gas accounting and production systems were completed by the software vendor in and were installed and tested by the company in november the company has monitor and control equipment with embedded chip technology which are utilized in production and gas processing operations 
the various systems were reviewed in conjunction with the overall year plan and were found to be year compliant based on manufacturers representations 
the company has also undertaken to monitor the compliance efforts of purchasers  vendors  contractors and other third parties third party providers with whom it does business and whose computer based systems and or embedded technology equipment interface with those of the company to ensure that operations will not be adversely affected by the year compliance problems of others 
there can be no assurance that there will not be an adverse effect on the company if third party providers do not convert their respective systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s information systems and embedded technology equipment 
however  management believes that ongoing communication with and assessment of the compliance efforts and status of third party providers will minimize these risks 
since the company s operations generally are not dependent on any single third party provider  the company is prepared to select third party providers which are year compliant by the fourth quarter of to date  the costs to implement the year plan have been nominal since the primary area for remediation involved software covered by a maintenance agreement 
the company does not expect to incur any significant costs during the remainder of to complete the year plan 
although the company anticipates minimal business disruptions as a result of year issues  in the event the computer based programs and embedded technology equipment of the company  or that owned and operated by third party providers  should fail to function properly  possible consequences include  but are not limited to  loss of communication links  inability to produce  process and sell oil and natural gas  loss of electric power  and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the company s business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe the company s strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices the company s financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
it is impossible to predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that the company can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on the company s ability to obtain capital for its exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on the company s levels of oil and gas production  a change in the price per bbl of oil and a 
change in the price per mcf of gas would result in an aggregate change in gross revenues of approximately million 
from time to time  the company has utilized hedging transactions with respect to a portion of its oil and gas production to mitigate its exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of price declines  such use may also limit any benefits which may be derived from price increases 
the company uses various financial instruments  such as swaps  collars and puts  whereby monthly settlements are based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of certain futures contracts quoted on the nymex or certain other indices 
generally  when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  the company receives a settlement from the counterparty based on the difference 
similarly  when the applicable settlement price is higher than the specified price  the company pays the counterparty based on the difference 
the instruments utilized by the company differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation which requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
during and continuing into  the oil and gas industry has operated in a depressed commodity price environment 
oil prices during the first quarter of fell to their lowest levels in history when adjusted for inflation 
although oil prices improved to some degree in late march  current prices remain substantially lower than levels achieved in in november  the company entered into swap arrangements on a significant portion of its oil production and realized a gain of million in on oil hedges 
in addition  the company hedged a portion of its gas production at various times beginning in november and realized net gains of million in on gas hedges 
as of december   the company had options to sell an aggregate of  barrels of oil production from january through june at a price of per barrel 
the company plans to enter into additional hedging arrangements when and if the market prices for future oil and gas production improve to favorable levels based on management s analysis of price expectations 
interest rates all of the company s outstanding indebtedness at december  is subject to market rates of interest as determined from time to time by the banks pursuant to the credit facility 
see capital resources 
the company may designate borrowings under the credit facility as either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
base rate loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to the discount rates established by the federal reserve board 
eurodollar loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and cash flow 
although various financial instruments are available to hedge the effects of changes in interest rates  the company does not consider the risk to be significant and has not entered into any interest rate hedging transactions 
based on the company s outstanding indebtedness at december  of million  a change in interest rates of basis points would affect annual interest payments by approximately
