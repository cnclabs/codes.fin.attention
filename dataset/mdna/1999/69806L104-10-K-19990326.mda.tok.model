funds from operations the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts in march the white paper defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management considers funds from operations an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on cash flow analyses 
the company computes funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the white paper 
the company s computation of funds from operations may  however  differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations utilized by other equity reits and  therefore  may not be comparable to such other reits 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the following table presents the company s actual funds from operations for the year ended december  and actual and pro forma funds from operations for the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report for an explanation of pro forma adjustments december  december  december  actual actual pro forma actual pro forma net income      add extraordinary loss  depreciation and amortization

comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in operating income due to property acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of additions to properties for the acquisitions 
the increase was also attributable to contributions to unconsolidated partnerships 
in the comparable period in  the use of cash for investing activities was primarily for the purpose of acquiring the remaining ownership interests in laurentian center and additions to property under development 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase resulted from amounts drawn on the company s unsecured line of credit  net proceeds of the ipo including the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option and increases in advances from rpc see note to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report prior to the ipo for certain of the acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by notes payable payments reflecting the paydown of a significant amount of portfolio debt in connection with the ipo 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer systems  software and devices with embedded technology that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures  miscalculations or disruptions in operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has conducted an assessment of how it may be impacted by the year issue and is implementing a comprehensive plan to address all known aspects of the issue 
based on the company s assessment of its internal computer systems including related hardware  software  customized applications and network systems with respect to the year issue  the company determined that its existing network and ibm as operating systems were not year compliant 
accordingly  the company recently replaced its network operating system with a new operating system and expects to complete a conversion to a new software package  which does not run on the ibm as but on a year compliant nt platform  by june  the company believes that these measures  the actual and estimated costs of which have been and are expected to continue to be immaterial in the aggregate  will enable its internal computer systems to be year compliant 
the company is also reviewing the efforts of its significant tenants  vendors and other service providers to become year compliant 
letters and questionnaires have been or are in the process of being sent to all critical entities with which the company does business to assess their year readiness 
the company will review the responses to such letters and questionnaires  assess the impact that the year readiness status of such entities may have on the company s operations  and take whatever action is deemed necessary 
based on responses received to date  there has been no indication that the respondents have any material concerns related to their ability to address all of their known significant year issues on a timely basis 
the company anticipates that these review activities will be on going for and will include any necessary follow up efforts 
the company  however  cannot presently estimate the total cost of this phase of its year readiness program 
although the review of such entities is continuing  the company is not currently aware of any third party circumstances with respect to the year issue that may have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company can provide no assurance that the year compliance plans of such third parties will be successfully completed in a timely manner 
based on the results to date of the company s internal assessment and external inquiries  the company does not believe that the year issue will pose significant operational problems for the company or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position 
although management believes it has undertaken a careful and thorough analysis  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing efforts are not completed in a timely manner with respect to the problems that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or adversely affect the company s relationships with tenants  vendors and other service providers 
further  management believes it has undertaken a careful survey of third party entities and does not believe there to be a material concern based upon the potential third party risks that have been identified  however  there can be no assurance that the year issues of these other entities will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
a contingency plan has not yet been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario resulting from the year issues as such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes the ipo and related formation transactions that were completed in august and the secondary offering which was completed in may improved its financial position through changes to its capital structure  which principally included a substantial reduction of its overall debt and its debt to equity ratio 
in connection with the formation transactions  the company repaid all of its existing floating rate mortgage debt 
as a result  the total principal amount of outstanding secured debt after the formation transactions and the acquisition of green valley town country was reduced by approximately  in connection with the secondary offering  the unsecured credit facility was paid down by approximately  these transactions resulted in a significant reduction in interest expense as a percentage of total revenue  for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  thus  cash from operations needed to fund debt service requirements was substantially decreased 
the total market capitalization of the company at december   was approximately  based on the market closing price at december  of per share assuming the conversion of ppp llc s  units and the debt outstanding of approximately  exclusive of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as a result  the company s debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately at december  on may  the company closed its secondary equity offering of  shares of common stock which included the partial exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the company believes that its capital structure combined with its unsecured credit facility enhances the company s ability to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as well as to provide funds for general corporate purposes 
in march  the company obtained an increase to its unsecured credit facility from  to  and a reduction in the borrowing rate thereunder to libor plus which rate is reduced to libor plus for as long as the company s debt to book value ratio is 
or below 
the company had  available under the unsecured credit facility at december  at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the unsecured credit facility bear interest at either libor plus or a reference rate 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts borrowed under the unsecured credit facility at december  was 
the company anticipates that the unsecured credit facility will continue to be used primarily to acquire additional properties and for general corporate purposes 
the company s indebtedness outstanding at december  requires balloon payments of  in   in   in   in  and  in the balloon payments due in the year include the balance drawn on the unsecured credit facility at december  of  it is likely that the company will not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these balloon amounts at maturity 
therefore  the company expects to refinance such debt either through additional debt financings secured by individual properties or groups of properties  by unsecured private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
at december   of the company s properties remained unencumbered 
the unsecured credit facility  which matures in  is renewable  subject to certain conditions 
the company expects to make distributions from cash available for distributions  which the company believes will exceed historical cash available for distributions due to the reduction in debt service resulting from the repayments of indebtedness described above and from the net cash flows from acquired properties 
amounts accumulated for distributions will be invested by the company primarily in short term investments such as collateralized securities of the united states government or its agencies  high grade commercial paper and bank deposits or will be used to pay down outstanding balances on the unsecured credit facility  if any 
the following table provides historical distribution information distribution quarter ended date declared record date date paid per share september  october  october  october  december  december  december  january  march  march  march  april  june  june  june  july  september  september  october  october  december  december  december  january  the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through its current working capital and net cash provided by operations 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow the company to make the distributions necessary to enable the company to continue to qualify as a reit 
the company also believes that the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
the company expects to meet certain long term liquidity requirements such as property acquisition and development  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 
the company also expects to use funds available under the unsecured credit facility to finance acquisition and development activities and capital improvements on an interim basis 
inflation substantially all of the leases provide for the recovery of real estate taxes and operating expenses incurred by the company 
in addition  many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures and percentage rent 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will be substantially offset by expense reimbursements  contractual rent increases and percentage rent described above 
the unsecured credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  which will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  and will be sensitive to inflation 
impact of accounting pronouncements issued but not adopted by the company in april  the aicpa accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires that costs incurred during start up activities  including organization costs  be expensed as incurred 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  initial application of sop should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
management believes that the adoption of sop will not have a material impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt         average interest rate variable rate libor debt 
   average interest rate principal amounts shown are in thousands 
for purposes of this disclosure  the fixed rate principal amount excludes  as that amount was repaid on january  the fair value of fixed rate debt and variable rate libor debt were determined based on the current rates offered for fixed rate debt and variable rate libor debt with similar risks and maturities 
except for the item noted in above  the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates
