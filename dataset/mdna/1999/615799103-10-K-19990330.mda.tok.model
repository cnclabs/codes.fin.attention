financial condition during the financial condition of the company significantly improved

operating activities generated cash sources of million from a decrease in accounts receivable  million from net non cash elements in earnings and million from a net change in other assets and liabilities 
operating activities used cash sources of million in accounts payable and million for inventory 
the company s present bank financing agreement  provides a million revolving line of credit through december  the facility provides for funding limited by a formula using accounts receivable balances and inventory levels as the primary variables 
interest on loans is charged at the prime rate or  at the option of the company  at the eurodollar rate plus a rate in a range of to depending on the financial leverage of the company 
in addition  the company pays a commitment fee on the unused line of credit 
substantially all assets of the company have been pledged as collateral and the agreement contains covenants and restrictions relating to asset protection  financial condition  dividends  investments  acquisitions and certain other matters 
at january   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the agreement 
management believes that the funding needs of the company for operating working capital and equipment purchases will continue to be met through cash flow from operations and financing available under its line of credit 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
the most significant planned capital expenditure  estimated to be million  is for the completion of development of computer software to replace substantially all of the company s business computer systems 
maintenance of the current systems  which were developed internally and enhanced over many years  has become expensive and problematic due to the age of the systems  the complexity of changes to the systems and the high cost and the limited availability of computer programmers 
year issues year issues are the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  an inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in other normal business activities 
the company has identified its year risks in three categories internal business software  internal non information technology software  and external vendor compliance 
internal information technology during  as part of a modernization program intended to improve productivity and increase profitability by upgrading data processing  integrating systems and enhancing internal reporting  the company purchased an integrated enterprise system which includes software which the vendor has represented to be year compliant 
the total estimated hardware  software  installation and training cost of the integrated enterprise system  of which year compliance is a by product  is million  of which million has been incurred to date  funded through operating cash flow 
the company is in the implementation phase for this system  with full implementation scheduled for mid based on this schedule  the company plans its internal information technology systems to be in substantial compliance before the year however  if due to unforeseen circumstances the implementation is not completed in a timely manner  year issues could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
contingency plans are being developed for areas where management considers there may be some risk to modify certain of the major existing internal information technology systems to be year compliant 
internal non information technology the company plans to assess the year compliance of its internal non information software and of the technology embedded in such systems as security  telecommunications and building systems by contacting the providers of such systems by mid since the company is in the information gathering phase  it does not have sufficient data to estimate the scheduling or costs of achieving year compliance for such systems or have a contingency plan in place therefore 
external vendor compliance the company is in the process of identifying and contacting its major suppliers  service providers and contractors vendors to determine the extent of their year compliance 
it plans that the process will be completed by mid to the extent that responses are unsatisfactory  the company intends to consider changing its major vendors to those who have represented year readiness  but cannot be assured that it will be successful in finding alternative vendors 
in the event that major vendors are not year compliant and the company does not replace them with new vendors  its business could be materially adversely affected 
the company plans to consider formulating a contingency plan for major vendors year non compliance in mid  after it receives responses from vendors
