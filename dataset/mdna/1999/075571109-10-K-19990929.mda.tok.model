item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks that may affect results in this section 
our fiscal year ends on june of each calendar year 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended june  in thousands statements of operations data net sales cost of sales  including buying and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other expenses income  net earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  store occupancy costs and buying costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs 
years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was attributable to the increase in comparable store sales  and million was attributable to stores not included in the comparable store sales base 
the increase in comparable store sales was attributable to a broader product line offering  strong consumer acceptance of the product line and improvements in the operational aspects of our business 
gross profit 
gross profit  which includes the cost of merchandise  buying and occupancy  increased to million for the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for the year from during fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from reduced occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales resulting from higher average store sales and  to a lesser extent  higher merchandise margins 
we believe that the gross margins attained during this most recent fiscal year are not sustainable and that gross margins will likely be lower in the current and future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to during the year ended june  from in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of net sales was largely due to favorable compensation expense leverage offset by increases in professional fees related to international trademark protection  registration and acquisition 
we recorded deferred compensation of million in connection with option grants in june  of which  was charged to expense for the year ended june  the remaining deferred compensation expense will be amortized over the vesting period of the options 
see note of notes to financial statements 
interest and other expense income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income net of other expenses during the year ended june  as compared to  in fiscal due to increases in average cash balances arising from operating results and proceeds of the company s initial public offering of shares in june  provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was as compared to in fiscal the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to investments in tax advantaged investments 
see note of notes to financial statements 
years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was attributable to the increase in comparable store sales  and million was attributable to stores not included in the comparable store sales base 
the increase in comparable store sales was attributable to a broader product line offering  strong consumer acceptance of the product line and improvements in the operational aspects of our business 
gross profit 
gross profit  which includes the cost of merchandise  buying and occupancy  increased to million for the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for the year from during fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from higher initial markups and lower markdowns associated with higher sell through rates  as well as reduced occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales resulting from higher average store sales 
in addition  during fiscal  we reviewed our fabric inventory and  for fabrics not directly associated with planned garment production orders  we took a charge against cost of sales and increased our inventory valuation allowance by million to reflect more appropriately the net realizable value of such fabrics 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to during the year ended june  from in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of net sales was largely a result of economies of scale related to the net sales increases offset in part by an increase in advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales 
for the year  advertising expense was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal we currently plan to maintain approximately the same level of advertising as a percentage of net sales in the future 
as previosly mentioned  we recorded deferred compensation of million in connection with option grants in june  of which  was charged to expense for the year ended june  see note of notes to financial statements 
interest and other expense income  net 
we generated  of interest and other income net of other expenses during the year ended june  as compared to  in fiscal we have no borrowings under our line of credit during the year ended june  due to increases in average cash balances arising from our improved operating results compared to net borrowing in the prior fiscal year 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was as compared to in fiscal the higher effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to increased taxable earnings and greater profitability in high tax rate states 
see note of notes to financial statements 
seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  we generate a disproportionate amount of our annual net sales in the first half of our fiscal year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons compared to the second half of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the first half of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be harmed 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited statements of operations data for each of the four quarters ended june   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of our total net sales for the periods indicated 
this data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of management  include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
june  march  december  september  statements of operations data net sales     gross profit     selling  general and administrative expenses     income from operations     earnings before income taxes     net earnings     basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share as a percentage of net sales net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations earnings before income taxes net earnings liquidity and capital resources during the three years ended june   we have satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving lines of credit and term loans 
primary uses of cash have been to purchase merchandise inventory  fund the construction of new stores and to remodel and renovate stores 
our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak in the first and second fiscal quarters 
at june   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
in addition  we had a revolving line of credit  under which it could borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million 
as of june   there were no borrowings under the line of credit and letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal and compared to was primarily the result of increases in income from operations and changes in working capital 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the primary use of these funds was for the opening of new stores and  to a lesser degree  the implementation of new computer systems within the stores and the corporate office 
we made substantial capital expenditures in connection with the opening and expansion of stores  the implementation of new systems to support store and corporate office functions and the expansion or relocation of our corporate offices and distribution center 
our capital expenditures was million in fiscal we opened seventeen new stores in fiscal we also expect to open approximately twenty stores in each of fiscal and  the majority of which will be in existing markets 
during fiscal  new store construction costs before tenant allowances averaged  the average gross inventory investment was  while pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  was less than  per store 
the average total cost to build new stores will vary in the future  depending on various factors  including local construction expenses  changes in store format and design and tenant improvement allowances 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash used by financing activities was million 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities primarily was derived from proceeds from the issuance of common stock arising from stock option exercises 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities related primarily to proceeds from the sale of million shares in our initial public offering of stock 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal primarily related to the repayment of the term note and revolving line of credit 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flow from operation  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements through fiscal our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the size and number of new and expanded stores  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  and future results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
year date conversion we have created a year task force that is implementing a six phase plan with the objective of ensuring that our management information systems will record  store  process  calculate and present calendar dates falling on or after and if applicable  spans of time including january  in the same manner  and with the same functionality as it has in years prior to collectively  year compliant 
we have completed a comprehensive review of our information systems and have updated our computer systems and applications in preparation for the year we are currently in the sixth phase of our plan  the contingency plan  which will be completed by october  total expenditures related to identification  testing  conversion  contingency  replacement and upgrading system applications are expected to range from  to  during fiscal and in certain cases  the conversions to applications which are year compliant have been made in conjunction with planned business system upgrades or enhancements 
in the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  our store operating and back end inventory management systems could fail 
if these systems fail  we may be unable to record sales transactions in our stores  which would result in a breakdown in the supply chain 
if this occurs  we would have to revert to a number of manual systems for recording sales  ordering product and replenishing our stores 
this would likely result in a loss of revenue  and it is not possible to quantify the possible range of such loss 
we have contacted the majority of our vendors and others on whom we rely to confirm that their systems will be converted before january  however  we cannot assure that the systems of other companies on which our systems rely will be year compliant by december  if another company fails to convert  it would have a harmful effect on our systems 
in a most reasonably likely worst case scenario  one or more significant suppliers could be unable to continue to adequately supply us after our fallback position would be to seek an alternative source of supply 
however  we cannot assure that such alternative sources of supply would be available 
such a contingency plan will be in place by the end of october  it is not practical for management to estimate the range of financial loss  if any  which could result from the negative effect that a disruption in supply would have on our business 
furthermore  we cannot assure that any or all of our systems are or will be year compliant  or that the ultimate costs required to address the year issue or the impact of any failure to achieve substantial year compliance will not have a harmful effect on our financial condition 
risk factors factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements discussed elsewhere in this report  as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals  include  but are not limited to  the following risks relating to our business if we miscalculate the demand for our products  our sales and profitability may be harmed 
our success depends on our ability to balance our inventory of merchandise with the demand for such merchandise 
if we miscalculate the demand for our products  we may be faced with significant excess inventory 
this would result in excess fabric for some products and missed opportunities for others 
this may result in weak sales and markdowns and or write offs  which could impair our profitability 
if we are not able to effectively manage our growth  our profitability may be harmed 
our continued growth depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to identify sites and open and operate new stores on a profitable basis 
we expect to open approximately stores in each of fiscal and our plan to expand successfully depends on the following factors the availability of desirable locations  the ability to negotiate acceptable leases for such locations  the ability to manage the expansion of the store base  the ability to source inventory adequate to meet the needs of new stores  the ability to operate stores profitably once opened  the development of adequate management information systems to support expanded activity  the ability to recruit and retain new employees  the availability of capital  and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending 
in selected markets  we plan to open flagship stores that will be larger and more expensive to operate than existing stores 
if these flagship stores do not generate sufficient revenues to cover their higher costs  our financial results could be negatively affected 
we cannot assure that we will achieve our planned expansion on a timely and profitable basis 
in addition  most of our new store openings in fiscal and will be in existing markets 
these openings may affect the existing stores net sales volumes and profitability 
furthermore  we will need to hire experienced executive personnel to support the planned improvements and expansions of our business 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in hiring such personnel in a time frame necessary to manage and support our expansion plans 
we may experience a decline in our rate of comparable store sales growth  which could affect our profitability 
we do not think that we can sustain the rate of comparable store sales growth achieved in recent periods 
we expect that such growth  if any  in the current and future periods will be lower than rates achieved in fiscal and during the recent periods of relatively high comparable store sales growth  we experienced favorable merchandise margins primarily because we were able to sell our merchandise with lower markdown rates due in part to the higher growth of same store sales 
as comparable store sales growth rates continue to moderate  we anticipate a decline in merchandise margins  which will reduce gross margins 
in addition  as newer and expanded stores become a larger percentage of the entire store base  we anticipate that we will see a rise in occupancy cost as a percentage of sales 
we anticipate that this rise will further reduce gross margins 
in addition  our selling  general and administrative expenses have decreased as a percentage of net sales in recent periods due in part to the rapid growth in net sales 
if same store sales growth rates slow  it will be more difficult for us to generate favorable selling  general and administrative expense leverage 
if we are not able to operate on a profitable basis  our stock price may be negatively affected 
we cannot guarantee that we will remain profitable in the future 
in the past years  profitability rates have varied widely from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
in particular  in fiscal  we experienced a significant financial downturn 
this was caused partly by problems in obtaining fabrication  misjudging related fashion trends  failing to obtain product deliveries in a timely manner  rapidly expanding our store base  and lacking sufficient controls and personnel to support such expanded activity 
our future results of operations will depend on the number and timing of new store openings 
also  it will depend on  among other things  our ability to identify and capitalize upon changing fashion trends  hire and retain qualified management and other personnel  maintain appropriate inventory levels  obtain needed raw materials  identify and negotiate favorable leases for successful store locations  reduce shrinkage  and control operating costs 
in addition  future results of operations will depend on factors outside of our control  such as general economic conditions  availability of third party sourcing and raw materials  and actions of competitors 
if we are not able to effectively upgrade and expand our management information systems  our operations may be harmed 
we have made significant investments to improve existing management information systems and implement new systems in the areas of production  merchandise allocation and distribution functions 
we cannot assure that these enhancements will be successfully implemented 
if we fail to implement and integrate such systems  it can have a harmful effect on our results of operations 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials or find production facilities  our financial condition may be harmed 
we do not own any production facilities and therefore depend on third parties to manufacture our products 
independent manufacturers make merchandise designed by the bebe in house design team with raw materials purchased from independent mills and other suppliers 
we place all of our orders for production of merchandise and raw materials by purchase order and do not have any long term contracts with any manufacturer or supplier 
we compete with approximately other companies for production facilities and raw materials 
if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials  it would have a harmful effect on our financial condition 
for example  in fiscal  we had difficulty obtaining needed quantities of raw materials on a timely basis because of competition with other apparel vendors for raw materials 
this resulted in a loss of sales and a decrease in gross profit 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
if we fail to maintain favorable relationships with these production facilities and to obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials on commercially reasonable terms  it could harm our business and results of operations 
if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or if their labor practices diverge from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states  it could harm our business and brand image 
while we recently adopted a policy to monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers by having an independent firm inspect these manufacturing sites  we cannot control the actions of such manufacturers  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using ethical labor practices 
we depend on third party apparel manufacturers  and our sales may be negatively affected if the manufacturers do not perform acceptably 
we develop a significant portion of our merchandise in conjunction with third party apparel manufacturers 
in some cases  we select merchandise directly from these manufacturers lines 
we do not have long term contracts with any third party apparel manufacturers and purchase all of the merchandise from such manufacturers by purchase order 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
we cannot assure that third party manufacturers will not supply similar products to our competitors  will not stop supplying products to us completely or will supply products that satisfy our quality control standards 
if we are not able to effectively upgrade and enhance our on line virtual store we may lose on line sales and our image may be harmed 
we plan to make additional significant investments to improve the performance and content of our existing web site over the next fiscal year 
we cannot assure you that these enhancements will be successfully implemented 
if we fail to implement and integrate such enhancements successfully  our results of operations may be harmed 
moreover  if we cannot develop an effective and engaging web site  potential future revenue that we would have otherwise gained through sales conducted over the internet and our image may be harmed 
if our foreign manufacturers are not able to provide us with sufficient merchandise to meet customer demand or if our imports are disrupted  our sales and profitability may be harmed 
we purchase our raw materials from mills and other suppliers  a significant portion of which is purchased from suppliers outside the united states  primarily in europe and asia 
we purchase a portion of our merchandise outside the united states  primarily in israel  china  hong kong and singapore 
we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad 
these risks include adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates particularly those of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies  changes in import duties or quotas  the imposition of taxes or other charges on imports  changes in foreign government regulation  political unrest  disruption or delays of shipments  and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our suppliers are located 
if any of the foregoing occurs  it could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
bilateral textile agreements between the united states and a number of foreign countries impose constraints on our import operations 
these agreements  which have been negotiated bilaterally either under the framework established by the arrangement regarding international trade in textiles  known as the multifiber agreement  or other applicable treaties  limit the amounts and types of merchandise which may be imported into the united states from these countries 
also  these agreements allow the united states to impose restraints at any time on importing merchandise that  under the terms of the agreements  are not currently subject to specified limits 
in addition  our imported products are subject to united states customs duties which make up a material portion of the cost of the merchandise 
if customs duties are substantially increased  it would harm our business and results of operations 
the united states and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty  or tariff levels  any of which could have a harmful effect on our business and results of operations 
also  manufacturing facilities in china produce a significant portion of our foreign supplied products 
recently  china and the united states have been in a number of trade disputes 
the united states has threatened to impose punitive tariffs and duties on products imported from china and to withdraw china s most favored nation trade status 
if china loses the most favored nation status  there are changes in the current tariff or duty structures or united states adopts other trade polices or sanctions adverse to china  it could harm our sales and profitability 
our business is seasonal and our quarterly results may fluctuate which may harm our stock price 
our sales volumes and levels of profitability fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
we tend to generate larger sales and  to an even greater extent  profitability levels in the first and second quarters  which include the fall and holiday selling seasons  of our fiscal year 
if for any reason sales are below seasonal norms during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  as they were in fiscal  our quarterly and annual results of operations would be harmed 
our quarterly financial performance may also fluctuate widely as a result of a number of other factors such as the number and timing of new store openings  acceptance of product offerings  timing of product deliveries  actions by competitors  and effectiveness of advertising campaigns 
due to these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our success depends on our key employees  the loss of whom could disrupt our business 
we depend upon the efforts of our key employees  particularly manny mashouf  the founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
none of our executive officers are bound by an employment agreement and therefore their employment is at will 
except for mr 
mashouf  we do not carry key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
if we lose the services of mr 
mashouf or any key officers or employees  it could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for experienced personnel  which we expect to continue 
we compete for experienced personnel with companies who have greater financial resources than we do 
in the past  we have experienced significant turnover of our retail store personnel 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain qualified personnel  it could harm our business and results of operations 
if we are not able to register or protect our trademarks  our ability to capitalize on the value of our brand name may be impaired 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success 
we have registered bebe and bebe moda in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
even though we take actions to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights  we cannot assure you that others will not imitate our products or infringe on our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we cannot assure that others will not resist or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their trademark and proprietary rights 
in certain jurisdictions  other entities may have rights to names that contain the word bebe  which could limit our ability to expand in such jurisdictions 
we are seeking to register our trademarks in targeted international markets which we believe represents large potential markets for our products 
in some of these markets  local companies currently have registered competing marks  and or regulatory obstacles exist that may prevent us from obtaining a trademark for the bebe name or related names 
in such countries  we may be unable to use the bebe name unless we purchase the right or obtain a license to use the bebe name 
we may not be able to register trademarks in these international markets  purchase the right or obtain a license to use the bebe name on commercially reasonable terms 
if we fail to obtain trademark  ownership or license rights  it would limit our ability to expand into certain international markets or enter such markets with the bebe name  and to capitalize on the value of our brand 
furthermore in some jurisdictions  despite successful registration of our trademarks  third parties may allege infringement and bring actions against us 
currently  we are evaluating our opportunities to expand our product offering and extend our geographic reach through licensing or joint venture arrangements 
we have limited experience with any such arrangements  and we cannot assure that such arrangements will be successful 
furthermore  while we intend to maintain control of the presentation and pricing of bebe merchandise through the terms of any such agreement  we cannot assure that any licensee or joint venture partner will comply with such contractual provisions 
any deviation from the terms of these contracts may harm our brand image 
we depend on two adjacent facilities  the loss of which could seriously disrupt our business 
currently  we operate corporate offices and a distribution center in brisbane  california 
any serious disruption at this facility whether due to fire  earthquake or otherwise would harm our operations and could have a harmful effect on our business and results of operations 
year failures may harm our operations 
many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could create erroneous results by or at the year we have created a year task force  which is implementing a six phase plan with the objective of ensuring that our management information systems will be year compliant 
we believe that the final phase of the plan will be completed by october  we cannot assure that this six phase plan will be successful or that year compliant issues will not arise with respect to products furnished by third party manufacturers or suppliers 
this may result in unforeseen costs or delays to us and therefore harm the company 
risks relating to our industry we face significant competition in the retail and apparel industry  which could harm our sales and profitability 
the retail and apparel industries are highly competitive and are characterized by low barriers to entry 
we expect competition in our markets to increase 
the primary competitive factors in our markets are brand name recognition  product styling  product presentation  product pricing  store ambiance  customer service  and convenience 
we compete with traditional department stores  specialty store retailers  off price retailers and direct marketers for  among other things  raw materials  market share  retail space  finished goods  sourcing and personnel 
because many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources than we do  we may lack the resources to adequately compete with them 
if we fail to compete in any way  it could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to deal with the risks inherent in the fashion and apparel industry  our profitability and brand image may be impaired 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends  shifting consumer demands and intense competition 
if we misinterpret the current fashion trends or if we fail to respond to shifts in consumer tastes  demand for bebe products  profitability and brand image could be impaired 
also  we cannot assure that our competitors will not carry similar designs  which would undermine bebe s distinctive image and may harm our brand image 
our future success partly depends on our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends  including products  styles  fabrics and colors 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to distinguish ourselves within the women s apparel market 
if economic conditions deteriorate  then it could have a negative impact on our business  sales and profitability 
the retail and apparel industries are subject to substantial cyclical variation 
a recession in the general economy or a decline in consumer spending in the apparel industry could harm our financial performance 
consumers generally purchase less apparel and related merchandise during recessionary periods and consumer spending may decline at other times 
a prolonged economic downturn could harm our financial condition 
we cannot assure that our customers would continue to make purchases during a recession 
risks relating to our common stock our stock price may fluctuate because of the small number of shares which can be publicly traded and the low average daily trading volumes 
the vast majority of our outstanding shares of our common stock are not registered and are subject to trading restrictions 
as of september   only  shares of our common stock were available to be publicly traded  and as a result  our average daily trading volumes are relatively low  and our stock price is vulnerable to market swings due to large purchases  sales and short sales of our common stock 
because a principal shareholder controls the company  other shareholders may not be able to influence the direction the company takes 
manny mashouf  the chairman  president and chief executive officer  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  he alone can control the election of directors and the outcome of all issues submitted to the shareholders 
this may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire shares  may discourage acquisition bids  and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of common stock 
this concentration of stock ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
if we issue preferred stock in the future  it may harm the market price of our common stock 
the board of directors has authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock at par value per share 
they also can fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of these shares without any vote or action by the shareholders 
if preferred stock is issued in the future  the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock 
if we issue preferred stock  it would provide us with desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
however  it could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of our company  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock 
as a result  the issuance of such preferred stock could harm the market value of the common stock 
we have no present plan to issue shares of preferred stock 
our stock price may be volatile because of risks inherent in the retail industry 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume volatility 
in addition  the market price of our common stock  like that of the stock of other retail and apparel companies  may be highly volatile due to certain risks inherent in the apparel industry 
factors such as quarter to quarter variations in the our net sales and earnings and changes in financial estimates by equity research analysts or other events or factors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate significantly 
further  due to the volatility of the stock market and the prices of stocks of retail and apparel companies generally  the price of the common stock could fluctuate for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends  which may affect the market price of our common stock 
we intend to retain any future earnings for use in our business and  therefore  do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future 
our future dividend policy will depend on our earnings  capital requirements and financial condition 
in addition  it will depend on any restrictions imposed by existing credit agreements and other factors considered relevant by the board of directors 
all of our restricted securities are eligible to be sold  which may cause dilution of our common stock 
we have a total of  shares of common stock outstanding 
of these shares   are held by the existing shareholders as restricted securities  which means they acquired these securities from our company in a transaction that did not involve a public offering 
these shares may be sold in the public market only if they are registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under rule of the securities act 
at this time  all restricted securities will be eligible to be sold  subject to certain volume and other limitations under rule as of june   options to purchase  shares of common stock were outstanding and exercisable  subject to certain vesting and repurchase restrictions 
stock plans on june  the board of directors adopted the stock plan the stock plan 
options granted under the stock plan have a ten year term and may be either incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  stock purchase rights or stock awards 
we have reserved  shares of common stock for issuance under the stock plan 
the options granted are immediately exercisable  but are subject to repurchase at the original exercise price in the event that the optionee s employment ceases for any reason 
our right of repurchase generally lapses over a four year period as follows in each of the first two years after the grant date and in the third and fourth years after the grant date  with full lapse of the repurchase option occurring on the fourth anniversary date 
see note of notes to financial statements 
stock purchase plan on april   our employee stock purchase plan the plan was adopted and approved by the shareholders 
a total of  shares of common stock has been reserved for issuance under the plan 
the plan will allow eligible employees to purchase our common stock in an amount which may not exceed of the employee s compensation 
the plan will be implemented by sequential month offerings 
each offering will generally be comprised of four  six month purchase periods  with shares purchased on the last day of each purchase period a purchase date 
the price at which stock may be purchased is equal to of the lower of fair market value of our common stock on the first day of the offering period or the purchase date 
there were  shares issued under the purchase plan in the fiscal year ended june  preferred stock on april   our shareholders granted the board of directors the authority to issue up to  shares of par value preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or approval by the shareholders 
no preferred stock has been issued to date
