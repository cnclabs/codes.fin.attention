item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background and history leisureplanet holdings  ltd 
formerly known as first south africa corp  ltd 
was incorporated in september with the intention of actively pursuing acquisitions fitting a pre defined investment strategy 
prior to our acquisition of lpi limited  an online travel services company  in february  the broad strategy followed by us in all of our investment decisions was as follows o turnover must be within the range of million million  o net income must yield a sustainable above average return on investment  o growth in turnover must be above average and must be sustainable over the medium term  and o the target must operate in one of the pre defined industry sectors identified by management 
we currently hold  through our south african subsidiary  first south african holdings pty 
ltd  nine south african subsidiaries which met the acquisition criteria identified above 
in addition  in february  we acquired an stake in lpi limited  an online travel services company 
also  during fiscal  we disposed of our interests in the industrial products and packaging industry segments 
our remaining subsidiaries are listed below and are engaged in the following industry segments internet and e commerce related businesses o lpi limited lifestyle products food division o piemans pantry o astoria bakery o seemanns meat products o gull foods o fifers bakery leisure division o sa leisure o galactex o republic umbrella o tradewinds parasol south african operations as our results are reported in us dollars  but our revenues are primarily generated in south african rand  the south african inflation rate and the depreciation of the south african rand against the us dollar are important to an understanding of our results 
in broad terms  if the depreciation of the south african rand against the us dollar is in excess of the south african inflation rate  then we would need to generate south african revenue in excess of the south african inflation rate to maintain us dollar parity 
the average rate for the south african rand against the us dollar for the periods presented in this report are as follows year ended year ended year ended june  june  june  rate of exchange vs depreciation year ended year ended year ended june  june  june  south african rand annual rate of inflation results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our revenues for fiscal are disclosed net of rebates  discounts and allowances of million  which amounts were not accounted for in the previous years due to the lack of adequate information 
our increase in revenues resulted primarily from growth in revenues in our lifestyle business segment  which grew by in us dollar terms  representing a growth in south african rand of  which is significantly better than inflation 
the increase is also attributable to the fact that our fiscal revenues only include the leisure division of our lifestyle products business for a nine month period 
finally  fiscal has also seen an increase in exports of south african manufactured products to european and american destinations 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased as a percentage of revenues from to 
this increase primarily resulted from the reclassification of certain manufacturing overhead costs to cost of goods sold during fiscal two of our lifestyle products subsidiaries  one in the leisure division and one in the food division  experienced difficulties arising from poor inventory control during fiscal  resulting in a significant charge to cost of goods sold 
the percentage of cost of goods sold to revenues for fiscal was increased by the reduction of revenues for rebates  discounts and allowances of million  discussed above 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues for fiscal excluding this reduction amounts to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  from million during fiscal to million during fiscal this decrease takes into account the selling  general and administrative expenses of our online travel services business 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the set off of rebates  discounts and allowances against revenues  discussed above 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is due primarily to the fact that the additional purchase price payments incurred under various of our acquisition agreements have been allocated to intangibles and therefore have been amortized 
depreciation 
depreciation increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is due primarily to the fact that we made various additions to property  plant and equipment in our lifestyle products business to promote our growth 
in addition  our fiscal numbers include the leisure division of our lifestyle products business for months  while our fiscal numbers only include our leisure division for months 
foreign currency loss 
foreign currency loss decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to a lower depreciation of the south african rand against the us dollar during fiscal than during fiscal gain on disposal of subsidiary stock 
gain on disposal of subsidiary stock decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to the fact that we realized lower proceeds from the sale of shares in our subsidiaries due to the depressed state of the south african market in fiscal  and the fact that the shares of our subsidiary which we sold during fiscal had a higher carrying cost than those sold during fiscal other income 
other income increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is due primarily to the fact that our fiscal numbers include the leisure division of our lifestyle products business for months  while our fiscal numbers only include our leisure division for months 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from net interest income of  in fiscal to net interest expense of million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the establishment of a capital redemption reserve fund during the fiscal for our outstanding increasing rate debentures  combined with the redemption of various debentures during fiscal  each of which utilized a substantial portion of our surplus reserves and caused a reduction in interest income earned on our reserves 
the reserve fund was established because the increasing rate debentures are required to be redeemed at a premium if certain specified share prices are not attained 
in addition  we accrued interest expense on our increasing rate debentures for a full year during fiscal  compared to eight months in fiscal provision for taxes on income 
our income tax provision decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the south african tax rate from to during fiscal loss from discontinued operations 
our loss from discontinued operations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our loss in fiscal resulted from the discontinuance of our industrial products and packaging business segments 
we decided to discontinue these segments since their performance was below average 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiary companies 
the minority interest in our subsidiaries increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to a decrease in our share holdings of first lifestyle holdings limited during fiscal from to approximately 
preference dividend declared 
during fiscal  our south african subsidiary  first south african holdings pty 
ltd  declared a preferred dividend of  no such dividend was declared or paid during fiscal this dividend was declared for the benefit of the holders of preferred stock of first south african holdings pty 
ltd 
the preferred stock was issued during fiscal to fund our acquisition of lpi limited 
net loss income 
as a result of the above  we achieved a loss of million as compared to a profit of in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues for the fiscal increased million  or  from million to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of various companies making up the leisure division  and the acquisition of two companies in the food division 
the sales from these companies for fiscal total million 
cost of sales 
cost of goods sold for fiscal increased to of revenues from of revenues for the comparative period in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative costs of million for fiscal has increased from million for the comparative period in fiscal this increase is due to the addition of the leisure division companies and two additional food subsidiaries during the fiscal year 
gain on disposal of subsidiary stock on disposal of subsidiary stock

in fiscal  the profit was realized on the disposal of an effective interest in first sa food holdings limited 
interest expense 
interest income of  has increased from  for the comparative period in fiscal interest for fiscal consists primarily of interest income earned on cash balances and surplus funds in the processed foods business 
provision for taxes on income 
our income tax provision increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase in the effective corporate tax rate from to  combined with an increase in taxable income while maintaining a relative constant base of non taxable income in us dollar terms 
loss from discontinued operations 
the discontinued industry segments contributed income of  during fiscal  compared to a loss of million in fiscal the loss in fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of a loss generating subsidiary which we were unable to make profitable 
net income 
net income of million has decreased from million  a decrease of over the comparative period in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the factors set forth above combined with a general depreciation of the south african rand against the us dollar during fiscal financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our cash increased million to million at june   from million at june  this increase was due primarily to funds raised on the issuance of preferred shares of our south african subsidiary  first south african holdings pty 
ltd  and the discontinuance of the industrial products and packaging businesses  which were largely cash negative 
our working capital increased million to million at june  from million at june  the working capital increase was due primarily to an increase in other current assets and a decrease in trade accounts payable and other payables 
at june   we had million in borrowings  an increase from million at june  our borrowings at june  include million owed to the minority shareholder of our on line travel services subsidiary  lpi limited 
excluding the amount owing to the minority shareholder of lpi limited  we reduced our borrowings by million during fiscal we did so by redeeming approximately of our convertible debentures and through the normal repayment of other loan funds 
our operations for fiscal  excluding non cash charges  resulted in the net utilization of cash of million 
that cash was used primarily to fund our online travel services business 
investing activities resulted in the net utilization of an additional million of cash during fiscal  including the acquisition of property  plant and equipment of million  additional purchase price payments of million and the acquisition of lpi limited for million 
our investing activities were financed primarily by the disposal of an additional of our ownership of first lifestyle holdings limited for million and the issuance of mandatory redeemable preferred shares of our south african subsidiary  first south african holdings pty 
ltd  for million 
net cash provided from financing activities amounted to million in fiscal  which was primarily raised by the issuance of preferred shares in our south african subsidiary  first south african holdings pty 
ltd 
for million 
future commitments under the various acquisition agreements we entered into acquiring certain of our businesses  we anticipate spending approximately  in cash on contingent payments over the next months  as well as approximately  in stock 
we anticipate that our cash on hand at june  and our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fully fund these payments 
we also anticipate that any longer term contingent acquisition payments will be funded out of operating cash flows of our acquired entities 
our operating subsidiaries generally collect their receivable within days and reserve approximately for doubtful accounts 
historically  our operating and capital needs have been met by internal cash flow and outside bank borrowing 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for the foreseeable future can continue to be met by internal cash flow and bank borrowing 
our operating subsidiaries engage in certain foreign exchange contracts with respect to certain overseas purchases in order to lock in a specified exchange rate 
due to the nature and stage of growth of our online travel services business  our online travel services subsidiary  lpi limited  incurs operational losses of approximately million per month with minimal revenues 
these costs are expected to increase over the coming months 
for example  under certain of our strategic agreements such as lycos  yahoo  infospace and nomade  we are required to make payments aggregating approximately million over the next months 
we anticipate paying for these expenses  as well as the anticipated operating losses of our online travel services business  through equity financing and or additional indebtedness 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to raise any additional equity financing or incur additional indebtedness 
we intend to continue to pursue an aggressive acquisition strategy of internet related businesses and in south africa 
we anticipate utilizing a substantial portion of our excess cash balances and operating cash flows to fund this strategy to the extent that suitable acquisition candidates can be identified 
in addition  we may be required to incur additional indebtedness or raise equity financing in connection with future acquisitions 
there is no assurance that we will be able to incur additional indebtedness or raise additional equity to finance future acquisitions on acceptable terms  if at all 
recently issued financial standards we believe that recently issued financial standards will not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems and software products will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies and governmental agencies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements or risk system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
we made a preliminary assessment of the year readiness of our operating  financial and administrative systems  including the hardware and software that comprise our systems 
based on our preliminary assessment  we believe that the significant risk that faces us regarding the year readiness of our systems relates to the year compliance of our utility suppliers  major suppliers  customers  and bankers 
we are currently confirming the year compliance of each of the foregoing 
based on the responses we have received  we believe that our risks have been adequately addressed 
in addition  where possible  we have identified alternative sources of supply where available 
however  certain of our existing suppliers are sole suppliers 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such third party systems will be year compliant 
a failure to be year compliant could result in lost revenues  increased costs or loss of customers and other business interruptions  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the costs incurred by us to date on year readiness have typically been to replace aging hardware and to upgrade existing purchased software 
in each case where upgraded software was required  the upgrade was available from software suppliers and those suppliers certified year compliance of such software 
our costs incurred to date have not been material 
however  there can be no guarantee that the costs to be incurred will not be material should a significant year compliance problem be subsequently discovered 
we are developing a contingency plan which will ensure that the production and distribution and the recording of transactions will continue should we have a significant year compliance problem 
for example  we are able to temporarily support a manual recording keeping system should our it system fail 
however  we cannot guarantee that our contingency plans will be sufficient to prevent significant disruption

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not ordinarily hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we do however recognize market risk from interest rate  foreign currency exchange and commodity price exposure 
interest rate risk at june   approximately million of our long term debt  specifically the borrowings in first lifestyle holdings limited  was subject to interest at variable rates 
similarly  our cash resources earn interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our net income and after tax cash flows are affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming the current level of cash resources and borrowings at variable interest rates and assuming a two percentage point decrease in the average interest rate under these borrowings and cash resources  it is estimated that the net effect on interest would be a reduction in interest earned of  resulting in a reduction in our net income and after tax cash flow of  any adverse changes in interest rates would likely result in our taking action to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that we would take and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no action is taken 
there can be no assurance that decreases or increases in interest rates will not exceed possible projections 
foreign currency risk our primary operations are based in south africa and most of our economic activity is denominated in south african rands 
this exposes us to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of the south african rand against the us dollar 
certain of this risk is covered through our purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
commodity price risk the lifestyle products segment of our business makes use of several commodity products 
processed foods the main ingredient in many of our processed food products includes raw produce such as meat  potatoes  vegetables and other staple products 
these food groups are commodities whose prices are largely dependent on supply and demand 
the supply of these products is also dependent on environmental factors such as weather conditions and rainfall patterns 
while these price fluctuations will impact on the input cost of the products produced  these are not expected to have a material impact on our profitability due to the pass through of commodity price increases to customers 
leisure products the leisure products side of our business make use of processed raw materials such as polypropylene  as well as natural resources such as timber 
the price of polypropylene is determined on an import parity basis in south africa  which means that worldwide surpluses and shortages are factored into the product pricing 
this results in fluctuations of the price of this material from time to time 
these price fluctuations impact on the per unit input cost of the products produced 
we  therefore  mitigate this risk by entering into pricing agreements with suppliers to limit the effects of any adverse movements in the commodity price 
timber as a natural resource is subject to sustainability requirements and is also dependent on environmental factors such as weather conditions and rainfall patterns 
the price of timber may fluctuate depending on supply and demand which has an impact on the input price of our products produced 
in order to mitigate this risk we enter into supply arrangements with suppliers wherever possible  including arrangements covering pricing terms 
in addition  raw material input prices may be passed onto customers where the factors governing such price fluctuations are outside of our control
