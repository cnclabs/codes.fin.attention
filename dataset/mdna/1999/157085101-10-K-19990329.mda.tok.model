item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of cerus should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
cerus actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere herein 
overview since its inception in  cerus has devoted substantially all of its efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of techniques and systems for inactivating pathogens in transfusion blood components 
cerus has been unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
all of cerus systems are in the research and development stage and cerus has not received any revenue from product sales 
cerus will be required to conduct significant research  development  preclinical and clinical evaluation and regulatory compliance activities on these systems that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after commercialization of its products under development 
cerus ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on its ability to successfully complete development  obtain regulatory approvals and achieve market acceptance of its pathogen inactivation systems 
there can be no assurance that cerus will ever achieve a profitable level of operations 
further  under the agreements discussed below  a significant portion of cerus development funding is provided by baxter based on an annual budgeting process 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be modified or terminated 
agreement with baxter for the development of pathogen inactivation systems for platelets 
in december  cerus entered into a development and commercialization agreement with baxter to develop a system for inactivation of pathogens in platelets used for transfusions 
the agreement was amended in december and june the amended agreement the platelet agreement provides for baxter and cerus to generally share system development costs equally  subject to mutually agreed budgets established from time to time and for a sharing of revenue from sales of inactivation system disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods above a specified level 
the june amendment provides for cerus  beginning april   to fund million of development costs previously to be funded by baxter 
at the time of the amendment  baxter agreed to purchase million of series a preferred stock and agreed to make a million cash milestone payment to cerus upon the approval by the fda of an application to market products developed under the platelet program or comparable approval in europe or upon termination of the platelet system development program 
as part of the june amendment  cerus increased its share of the adjusted product revenue from future sales of the platelet system disposables from approximately of adjusted product revenue to approximately in exchange for cerus agreement to pay baxter million on june  cerus may defer such payment for up to twelve months under certain circumstances 
in addition to the sale of million of series a preferred stock  cerus has received a million equity investment under the platelet agreement from baxter and has recognized approximately million in revenue from baxter from inception cumulatively through december   including million in license fees  million in milestone payments and approximately million in development funding 
license fees and payments for achieved milestones are non refundable and are not subject to future performance 
development funding is in the form of payments made by baxter to cerus if necessary to reimburse cerus for development spending in excess of the levels agreed to by baxter and cerus 
development funding revenue is recognized as the related project costs are incurred 
agreement with baxter for the development of pathogen inactivation systems for red blood cells and ffp 
in january and july  cerus and baxter entered into interim funding agreements related to the development of pathogen inactivation systems for plasma and red blood cells used for transfusions 
in april  cerus entered into a development and commercialization agreement with baxter  principally focused on the development of fresh frozen plasma ffp and red blood cell pathogen inactivation systems 
the agreement was amended in march and june the amended agreement the rbc ffp agreement provides for baxter and cerus generally to share red blood cell system development costs equally  subject to mutually agreed to budgets established from time to time 
the rbc ffp agreement also provides for an equal sharing of revenue from sales of red blood cell inactivation system disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods and a specified percentage allocation is retained by baxter for marketing and administrative expenses 
under the rbc ffp agreement  cerus and baxter equally funded the ffp program development through december  after which time baxter s funding commitment for the ffp development program is limited to million payable in equal installments of  each in january and january the rbc ffp agreement also provides for cerus to receive and baxter to receive of revenue from sales of ffp inactivation system disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods and a specified percentage allocation not to exceed of revenue is retained by baxter for marketing and administrative expenses 
under cerus direction  baxter will be responsible for manufacturing and marketing the ffp product  and will retain its exclusive  worldwide distribution license 
under the rbc ffp agreement  cerus has received million in equity investments from baxter and has recognized approximately million in revenue from baxter  cumulatively through december   to fund the development of the red blood cell and ffp systems 
development funding is in the form of payments made by baxter to cerus if necessary to reimburse cerus for development spending in excess of the levels agreed to by baxter and cerus and to reimburse cerus for fee for service development activities 
development funding revenue is recognized as the related project costs are incurred 
the rbc ffp agreement also provides for baxter to make a million equity investment in cerus common stock  subject to approval by the fda to commence phase clinical trials of the platelet system in the united states 
in january  cerus  in conjunction with the fda  determined the preliminary framework governing the phase protocol 
as a result  baxter will make the investment on april   at per share  which is equal to of the average closing price of the common stock for the thirty trading days prior to and including february results of operations years ended december    and revenue 
cerus anticipates that its sources of revenue until product sales occur will be limited to payments under development and commercialization agreements with baxter in the area of blood component pathogen inactivation  payments from other collaboration agreements  including cerus agreement with the consortium for plasma science the consortium  and payments from the united states government under research grant programs 
revenue earned under the agreements with baxter for the years ending december   and was million  million and million and accounted for  and of cerus total revenue  respectively 
revenue from baxter decreased in from  primarily due to greater increases in total development expenses on the platelet and red blood cell programs by baxter relative to increased development expenses by cerus and cerus agreement to fund a portion of baxter s development commitment for the platelet system in revenue from baxter increased in from  as cerus recognized milestone and license fee revenue related to the platelet program of approximately million and recognized increased development revenue primarily relating to its ffp and red blood cell programs 
government grant revenue  generally unchanged among the periods  was approximately   and  for the years  and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
cerus research and development expenses include both the internal and external expenses relating to the development of its products 
internal research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel expenses  laboratory supplies and overhead operating expenses 
external research and development expenses primarily include those relating to the manufacturing of its compounds  preclinical toxicology studies  clinical trials and protecting and maintaining intellectual property 
research and development expenses for the years ending december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in and were due principally to third party costs  particularly toxicology studies  compound manufacturing development and initiation of clinical trials relating to the platelet and ffp programs  as well as to increased activity at cerus in the ffp and red blood cell programs 
a significant portion of the increase was the result of increased payroll and other personnel expenses  related laboratory supplies  equipment and facilities expansion 
in addition  under amendments to the platelet agreement  cerus recognized research and development expenses in and of million and million  respectively  to increase its share of platelet pathogen inactivation system adjusted product revenue from to 
cerus anticipates that its research and development expenses will increase as its platelet and ffp systems enter large scale phase clinical trials and as development activity relating to its other products increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for administrative  finance  human resource and executive personnel  legal  accounting and other professional fees and overhead operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million in  million in and million in the increases were primarily attributable to increased personnel levels associated with the expansion of cerus operations 
cerus expects its general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as it expands its development activities 
other income expense 
other income expense consists primarily of interest earned on cash balances and short term investments 
interest income was approximately million in  million in and  in the increase in and from was attributable primarily to increased average cash balances related to proceeds from cerus initial public offering and private placements of common and preferred stock to baxter 
interest expense was relatively unchanged and was approximately   and  for the years  and  respectively 
cerus typically maintains substantial balances of cash and short term investments to fund future research and development activities 
cerus expects to earn interest at market rates in proportion to the cash balances it maintains 
liquidity and capital resources cerus sources of capital to date have consisted of public and private placements of equity securities  development funding by baxter  united states government grants and interest income 
to date  cerus has not received any revenue from product sales  and it will not derive revenue from product sales unless and until one or more planned products receives regulatory approval and achieves market acceptance 
at december   cerus had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
in january  cerus completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock  generating net proceeds after deduction of offering costs of approximately million 
concurrent with this offering  cerus sold directly to baxter an additional  shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in october  cerus completed a private placement of  shares of common stock to baxter for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in july  baxter purchased  shares of series a preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the series a preferred stock will convert to cerus common stock upon the approval of a new drug application nda or pre market approval pma or equivalent by the fda or a ce marking approval in europe under the platelet agreement or upon termination of cooperative development work under the platelet agreement 
in the event of marketing approval  each share of series a preferred stock shall automatically be converted into that number of shares of common stock equal to  the original issue price divided by one hundred twenty percent of the average closing price of the common stock for the thirty trading days prior to and including the trading day immediately prior to the event of the marketing approval 
in the event of a program termination  each share of series a preferred stock shall automatically be converted into that number of shares of common stock equal to the original issue price divided by the average closing price of the common stock for the thirty trading days commencing with the fifteenth th trading day prior to the event of program termination 
cerus has the right to redeem the series a preferred stock prior to conversion for a million cash payment 
in the event of a program termination  baxter may require cerus to redeem the series a preferred stock for a million cash payment 
in july  cerus completed a private placement to baxter pursuant to cerus achievement of a milestone under the rbc ffp agreement 
baxter purchased  shares of common stock at one hundred twenty percent of the average closing price of the common stock for the thirty trading days prior to the purchase for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in january  cerus  in consultation with the fda  determined the preliminary framework governing cerus phase clinical trial protocol for its platelet pathogen inactivation system 
as a result  baxter will purchase million of cerus common stock on april  at per share  which is of the average closing price of the common stock for the thirty trading days prior to and including february  in march  baxter purchased  shares of series b preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
each share of series b preferred stock becomes convertible at baxter s option into shares of cerus common stock on march  upon cerus completion of cumulative equity financings with parties other than baxter in excess of million  including this offering  the series b preferred stock will earn a premium of per annum for a period not to exceed one year 
cerus has the right to redeem the series b preferred stock prior to conversion for a payment to baxter equal to the aggregate purchase price of the shares redeemed 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million in  compared to million in the use of cash primarily resulted from net losses of million offset by an increase in accounts payable to baxter of million and a decrease in accounts receivable from baxter of million 
accounts payable to baxter increased primarily due to research and development expenses of million incurred to increase cerus share of future product revenue from the platelet pathogen inactivation system  as well as reimbursement of baxter s portion of the development costs for the platelet and ffp programs in cerus intends to fund the payable to baxter from available cash resources and the proceeds from the sale of series b preferred stock to baxter 
net cash used in investing activities in of approximately million resulted principally from purchases of million of short term investments offset by the maturities of million of short term investments and the purchase of approximately  furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to increases in accounts payable to baxter and the decrease in accounts receivable from baxter 
cerus believes that its available cash balances  together with anticipated proceeds of this offering  cash flows from existing baxter and grant arrangements  will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements for at least the next eighteen months 
these near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors including the development progress of cerus pathogen inactivation systems  payments and equity investments by baxter  potential deferral of the payment to baxter of million due on june  to june   and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending cerus intellectual property position 
cerus long term capital requirements will be dependent on these factors in addition to cerus ability to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financings or through additional collaborative arrangements or government grants  the achievement of milestones  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of cerus pathogen inactivation systems and other products under development  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to investors in cerus 
there can be no assurance that capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
there can be no assurance that cerus will be able to meet its capital requirements for this or any other period 
impact of the year the year yk issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
such computer systems will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
cerus has implemented a program to assess its exposure from yk related failures in its internal systems and those of its significant suppliers 
cerus has identified internal computer systems and software and instrumentation that is critical to its operations and may be subject to the yk issue  such as microprocessor based analytical equipment 
based on its assessment to date  cerus has determined that it will be required to upgrade or replace a portion of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
cerus estimates that costs associated with the upgrade and conversion of existing computer software relating to the yk issue will be less than  cerus has contacted its significant third party suppliers  including baxter  to assess their compliance with the yk issue 
there can be no assurance that costs will not exceed cerus estimate or that other companies on which it relies will not experience yk issues that have a material adverse effect on cerus operations 
if cerus is unable to upgrade its systems and software for yk compliance or if third parties on which cerus relies are unable to operate fully due to a lack of yk compliance  cerus operations may be materially adversely affected 
cerus does not currently have a contingency plan in the event that cerus or its significant suppliers systems are not yk compliant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cerus maintains an investment portfolio of various issuers  types  and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  if material 
unrealized gains and losses at december  and were not material 
cerus investments primarily consist of short term money market mutual funds  united states and state government obligations and commercial paper 
of cerus investments balance of million at december   approximately have original maturity dates of less than days and of this balance have original maturities of days to one year 
cerus does not believe its exposure to interest rate risk to be material given the short term nature of its investment portfolio
