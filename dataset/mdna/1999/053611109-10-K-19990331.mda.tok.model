year the year yk issue is the result of computer programs being written for  or microprocessors using  two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
company computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in system failures or miscalculations 
the company is currently working to mitigate the yk issue and has established processes for assessing the risks and associated costs 
the company categorizes its yk efforts as follows hardware  software  embedded processors  vendors and customers 
progress in assessing and remediating information technology systems hardware and software and non information technology systems embedded processors continues to be tracked in phases including assessment  identification of non compliant systems  remediation  testing and verification 
hardware  software and embedded processors have been assessed and remediation is in progress 
the company s yk project is progressing and a large portion of its internal remediation work was completed at year end the company is using internal and external resources to remediate and test its systems 
the company has initiated communications with significant vendors and customers to coordinate the yk issue  and is in the process of determining the company s vulnerability if these companies fail to remediate their yk issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies will be timely remediated  or that other companies failure to remediate yk issues would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company continues to develop contingency plans to mitigate risks associated with the yk issue 
costs incurred to date in addressing the yk issue have been expensed as incurred and are not material 
based on current information  the total cost to remediate and test the company s systems is not expected to be material 
the company presently believes that with remediation  yk risks can be mitigated 
although the company is not currently aware of any material internal operational or financial yk related issues  the company cannot provide assurances that the computer systems  products  services or other systems upon which the company depends will be yk ready on schedule  that the costs of its yk program will not become material or that the company s contingency plans will be adequate 
the company is currently unable to evaluate accurately the magnitude  if any  of the yk related issues arising from the company s vendors and customers 
if any such risks either with respect to the company or its vendors or customers materialize  the company could experience serious consequences to its business which could have material adverse effects on the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the company does not hold or purchase any foreign currency or interest rate contracts for trading purposes 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
as a result  the company enters into foreign exchange forward  option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs 
the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures 
the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s consolidated net income 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company will periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowings 
the company had no interest rate contracts outstanding at year end in the normal course of operations  the company also faces other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions  other risks associated with foreign operations  commodity price risk and litigation risk which are not represented in the analyses that follow 
foreign exchange value at risk the company uses a value at risk var model to determine the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings associated with both its foreign exchange positions and contracts 
this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions 
firm commitments  receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were included in the model 
forecasted transactions  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var was estimated using a variance covariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency 
the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on historical observations  using one year s data with equal weightings 
this data was obtained from the publicly available jp morgan riskmetrics data set on the internet 
a percent confidence level was used for a one day time horizon 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings for the company s foreign exchange positions and contracts would have been immaterial to the company s earnings 
interest rate sensitivity an assumed basis point move in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average floating rate interest rates affecting the company s variable rate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on the company s earnings
