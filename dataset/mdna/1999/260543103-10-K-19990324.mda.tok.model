equally aggressive are the goals to reduce leaks  spills  fires  explosions  work related injuries and transportation incidents by percent 
dow is on track or ahead of schedule in most of these areas 
more information on dow s eh s policies  systems and performance can be found in the eh s progress report on the internet at www 
dow 
com 
in addition to our voluntary commitments  dow s global operations are subject to increasingly stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation 
dow s environmental responsibilities and potential liabilities receive direct and ongoing scrutiny by management to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations 
dow s environmental management standard clearly defines the overall environmental systems  performance objectives  and design requirements needed to minimize the long term cost of environmental protection and to comply with these laws and regulations 
it is dow s stated policy that all global operations and products meet dow s environmental management standard or their country s laws and regulations  whichever is more stringent 
assessments are used by management to continually measure and report dow s progress against this standard and its performance objectives 
at sites in europe  canada and the united states  the company also receives third party verification of dow s compliance with responsible care and with outside specifications such as iso it is dow s policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment 
first  dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research  process design  plant operations and maintenance 
second  dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials 
finally  unusable or non recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste 
treatment may include destruction by chemical  physical  biological or thermal incineration means 
disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated 
dow has specific requirements for wastes that are transferred to non dow facilities 
wastes that are recycled  treated or recovered for energy off site represent less than percent of the total amount of wastes reported as part of the pollution prevention act 
dow accrues the costs of site remediation for its facilities based on current law and existing technologies 
in the case of a landfill  dow accrues the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the nature of such remediation includes the cleanup of soil contamination and the closure of landfills and other waste management facilities 
the policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
dedicated dow joint ventures provide strategic management to identify cost effective solutions for certain remediation liabilities at the company s us manufacturing locations 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies for handling site remediation and restoration 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow is named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal or state superfund statutes at approximately sites 
dow readily cooperates in remediation where its liability is clear  thereby minimizing legal and administrative costs 
this approach  coupled with dow s long standing preference for on site waste treatment  has resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of superfund sites in which dow is involved 
page environment continued because current law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a superfund site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies which have also been named prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps  and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
management estimated that the company s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites at december   was million 
receivables of million for probable third party recoveries from other prps have been recorded related to superfund sites 
in addition  dow reached settlement with several insurance carriers in for recovery of past superfund expenditures 
the company is currently involved in litigation with numerous other insurance carriers seeking additional recoveries 
in addition to superfund related liability  dow had an accrued liability of million at december   related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
the company had not recorded as a receivable any third party recovery related to these sites 
in total  dow s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount 
it is the opinion of dow management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those accrued or disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for environmental protection were million in  million in and million in year readiness disclosure state of readiness the company s year yk project  which began in early  is a global effort covering information systems  process control and embedded systems for all of the company s businesses 
the project is designed to address  through use of reasonable commercial efforts  the risk that certain internal or external systems may inaccurately interpret dates after december  the project is led by a senior director of information systems who reports to the chief information officer and an executive steering team  and is managed by a global team consisting of technical  functional and business leaders 
since early  the audit committee of the company s board of directors has received quarterly reports on the team s plan and progress 
many of the company s strategic business systems have already been upgraded and tested and  except as noted below  project completion is anticipated in the first half of the first two phases of the yk project have been completed 
phase i  the business study  established an awareness of the problem and developed the overall strategy 
during phase ii  the project study  the company inventoried and assessed applications  infrastructure and embedded systems for yk problems  selected the remediation tools  and prioritized the remediation projects 
the plans resulting from these studies continue to be updated as new information becomes available 
phase iii  remediation  includes the efforts to upgrade  test for yk readiness and implement needed changes and new systems 
this phase is in progress and almost all elements  as noted below  are expected to be complete by mid year phase iv  business contingency planning  is also in progress and  as discussed below  any necessary plans will be implemented as needed 
the information systems infrastructure team is responsible for yk remediation of hardware  systems software and the telecommunications network 
the remediation phase was more than percent complete at the end of and is expected to be complete by mid the information systems applications software organization is responsible for the remediation of applications and  at the end of  the remediation phase was more than percent complete 
remediation of all business critical applications is expected to be completed by mid the company s implementation of enterprise wide financial and operational systems and standardized desktop computing during the last several years has facilitated this effort 
two critical replacement projects are in progress and are on target to be completed by mid a contingency plan has been established for one of these projects  and a plan is being developed for the other  should either of these projects miss the scheduled completion dates 
the company has common process control systems in more than percent of its plants globally  and during the project study  the company determined that percent of the common systems needed to be upgraded with yk ready software 
approximately percent of the company s process control systems are commercial systems  and these have been assessed  and those requiring upgrades are being remediated during scheduled plant shutdowns

page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  pursuant to established guidelines and policies  that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk 
a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional exposure within established limits and policies 
the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company s results 
the global nature of dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global scale  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows  keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts and over the counter option contracts 
main exposures are related to assets and liabilities denominated in the currencies of europe  asia pacific and canada  bonds denominated in foreign currencies mainly the euro  deutsche mark  swiss franc and japanese yen  and economic exposure derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows 
the majority of the foreign exchange exposure is related to the japanese yen  deutsche mark  dutch guilder and other european currencies 
the main objectives of interest rate risk management are to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile 
dow uses interest rate swaps  swaptions and exchange traded instruments to accomplish these objectives 
the company s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 
inherent in dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities 
some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments 
cracker feedstocks and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures 
over the counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 
the risk of these hedging instruments is not material 
dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived from its acquisition and divestiture activity 
this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company s market risk policies and procedures 
dow uses value at risk var  stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 
var estimates the potential gain or loss in fair market values  given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time  using specified confidence levels 
on an ongoing basis  the company estimates the maximum gain or loss that could arise in one day  given a two standard deviation move in the respective price levels 
these amounts are immaterial in comparison to the equity and earnings of the company 
the var methodology used by dow is based primarily on the variance covariance statistical model 
as an example  the average daily var  using a percent confidence level at december  and  for foreign exchange  interest rate and equity exposures  net of hedges  was foreign exchange million and million  interest rate million and million  and equity million and million  respectively
