item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations  including trends which might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
the discussion of the company s results of operations reported in the consolidated statements of operations compares the years ended december  and  as well as december  and certain comparisons between the periods are made on a percentage basis as well as on a weighted average gross leasable area gla basis  a technique which adjusts for certain increases or decreases in the number of centers and corresponding square feet related to the development  acquisition  expansion or disposition of rental properties 
the computation of weighted average gla  however  does not adjust for fluctuations in occupancy which may occur subsequent to the original opening date

the remaining  square feet is scheduled to open during the second half of see general overview 
commitments for construction of these projects which represent only those costs contractually required to be paid by the company amounted to million at december  the company also is in the process of developing plans for additional expansions and new centers for completion in and beyond 
currently  the company is in the preleasing stages for a future center in bourne  massachusetts and for further expansions of three existing centers 
however  these anticipated or planned developments or expansions may not be started or completed as scheduled  or may not result in accretive funds from operations 
in addition  the company regularly evaluates acquisition or disposition proposals  engages from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions and may from time to time enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties 
any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent also may not be consummated  or if consummated  may not result in accretive funds from operations 
during  the company discontinued the development of its concord  north carolina  romulus  michigan and certain other projects as the economics of these transactions did not meet an adequate return on investment for the company 
as a result  the company recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter to write off the carrying amount of these projects  net of proceeds received from the sale of the company s interest in the concord project to an unrelated third party 
the company maintains revolving lines of credit which provide for unsecured borrowings up to million  of which million was available for additional borrowings at december  as a general matter  the company anticipates utilizing its lines of credit as an interim source of funds to acquire  develop and expand factory outlet centers and repaying the credit lines with longer term debt or equity when management determines that market conditions are favorable 
under joint shelf registration  the company and the operating partnership could issue up to million in additional equity securities and million in additional debt securities 
with decline in the real estate debt and equity markets  the company may not  in the short term  be able to access these markets on favorable terms 
management believes the decline is temporary and may utilize these funds as the markets improve to continue its external growth 
in the interim  the company may consider the use of operational and developmental joint ventures and other related strategies to generate additional capital 
based on cash provided by operations  existing credit facilities  ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and funds available under the shelf registration  management believes that the company has access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during during  the company terminated a million secured line of credit and increased its unsecured lines of credit by million 
at december   approximately of the outstanding long term debt represented unsecured borrowings and approximately of the company s real estate portfolio was unencumbered 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding on december  was 
during march  the company refinanced its notes which had a carrying amount of million at december  the refinancing reduced the interest rate to  increased the loan amount to million and extended the maturity date to april the additional proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the revolving lines of credit 
as a result of this refinance  management expects to realize a savings in interest cost of approximately  over the next twelve months 
in addition  the company extended the maturity of one of its revolving lines of credit from june to june the company anticipates that adequate cash will be available to fund its operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although the company receives most of its rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions to shareholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior  unsecured notes are made semi annually 
amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the existing lines of credit or invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
certain of the company s debt agreements limit the payment of dividends such that dividends will not exceed funds from operations ffo  as defined in the agreements  for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or of ffo on a cumulative basis from the date of the agreement 
market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments based on a contractual principal amount and time period 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   the company had an interest rate swap agreement effective through october with a notional amount of million 
under this agreement  the company receives a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and pays a fixed interest rate of 
these swaps effectively change the company s payment of interest on million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt for the contract period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
at december   the company would have paid  to terminate the agreements 
a decrease in the day libor index would increase the amount paid by approximately  the fair value is based on dealer quotes  considering current interest rates 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt at december  was million 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices  where available  using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas requires public business enterprises to adopt its provisions for fiscal years beginning after december   and to report certain information about operating segments in complete sets of financial statements of the enterprise issued to shareholders 
the company believes all of its centers have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to similar types and classes of customers 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company has aggregated the financial information of all of its centers into one reportable operating segment 
on june   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities asfas 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
management of the company anticipates that  due to its limited use of derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
funds from operations management believes that for a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo should be considered along with net income as presented in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is presented because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by certain investors and analysts to analyze and compare one equity real estate investment trust reit with another on the basis of operating performance 
ffo is generally defined as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  before extraordinary items and gains losses on sale of properties  plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate 
the company cautions that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by the company may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of operating performance or to cash from operations as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund dividends to shareholders and other cash needs 
below is a calculation of funds from operations for the years ended december   and as well as actual cash flow and other data for those respective years in thousands funds from operations income before gain on sale of real estate  minority interest    and extraordinary item adjusted for depreciation and amortization uniquely    significant to real estate asset write down  funds from operations before minority interest    cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares outstanding    assumes the partnership units of the operating partnership held by the minority interest  preferred shares of the company and share and unit options are all converted to common shares of the company 
economic conditions and outlook the majority of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which the company believes often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and advertising and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
while factory outlet stores continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for brand name manufacturers  some retail formats are more successful than others 
as typical in the retail industry  certain tenants have closed  or will close  certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
as part of its strategy of aggressively managing its assets  the company is strengthening the tenant base in several of its centers by adding strong new anchor tenants  such as nike  gap and nautica 
to accomplish this goal  stores may remain vacant for a longer period of time in order to recapture enough space to meet the size requirement of these upscale  high volume tenants 
consequently  the company anticipates that its average occupancy level will remain strong  but may be more in line with the industry average 
approximately of the company s lease portfolio is scheduled to expire during the next two years 
approximately  square feet of space is up for renewal during and approximately  square feet will come up for renewal in if the company were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms  the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong 
approximately  or  of the square feet scheduled to expire in has already been renewed 
in addition  the company continues to attract and retain additional tenants 
the company s factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of creditworthy tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  the company reduces its operating and leasing risks 
no one tenant including affiliates accounts for more than of the company s combined base and percentage rental revenues 
accordingly  management currently does not expect any material adverse impact on the company s results of operation and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released 
year compliance the year yk issue refers generally to computer applications using only the last two digits to refer to a year rather than all four digits 
as a result  these applications could fail or create erroneous results if they recognize as the year rather than the year the company has taken yk initiatives in three general areas which represent the areas that could have an impact on the company information technology systems  non information technology systems and third party issues 
the following is a summary of these initiatives information technology systems 
the company has focused its efforts on the high risk areas of the corporate office computer hardware  operating systems and software applications 
the company s assessment and testing of existing equipment and software revealed that certain older desktop personal computers  the network operating system and the dos based accounting system were not yk compliant 
the non compliant personal computers have since been replaced 
the company is currently in the process of installing and testing current upgrades for the dos based accounting and the network operating systems which will make these systems compliant with yk and expects to complete this process by june non information technology systems 
non information technology consists mainly of facilities management systems such as telephone  utility and security systems for the corporate office and the outlet centers 
the company is in the process of relocating its corporate office to a nearby facility 
the company has reviewed the corporate facility management systems and made inquiry of the building owner manager and concluded that the corporate office building systems including telephone  utilities  fire and security systems are yk compliant 
the company is in the process of identifying date sensitive systems and equipment including hvac units  telephones  security systems and alarms  fire warning systems and general office systems at its outlet centers 
assessment and testing of these systems is about complete and expected to be completed by june  critical non compliant systems will be replaced in early based on preliminary assessment  the cost of replacement is not expected to be significant 
third parties 
the company has third party relationships with approximately tenants and over  suppliers and contractors 
many of these third parties are publicly traded corporations and subject to disclosure requirements 
the company has begun assessment of major third parties yk readiness including tenants  key suppliers of outsourced services including stock transfer  debt servicing  banking collection and disbursement  payroll and benefits  while simultaneously responding to their inquiries regarding the company s readiness 
the majority of the company s vendors are small suppliers that the company believes can manually execute their business and are readily replaceable 
management also believes there is no material risk of being unable to procure necessary supplies and services from third parties who have not already indicated that they are currently yk compliant 
third party assessment is abut complete and the company is diligently working to substantially complete this part of the project 
the company also intends to monitor yk disclosures in sec filings of publicly owned third parties commencing with the current quarter filings 
costs 
the accounting software and network operating system upgrades are being executed under existing maintenance and support agreements with software vendors  and thus the company does not expect to incur additional costs to bring those systems in compliance 
approximately  has been spent to upgrade or replace equipment or systems specifically to bring them in compliance with yk 
the total cost of yk compliance activities  expected to be less than  has not been  and is not expected to be material to the operating results or financial position of the company 
the identification and remediation of systems at the outlet centers is being accomplished by in house business systems personnel and outlet center general managers whose costs are recorded as normal operating expenses 
the assessment of third party readiness is also being conducted by in house personnel whose costs are recorded as normal operating expenses 
the company is not yet in a position to estimate the cost of third party compliance issues  but has no reason to believe  based upon its evaluations to date  that such costs will exceed  risks 
the principal risks to the company relating to the completion of its accounting software conversion is failure to correctly bill tenants by december  and to pay invoices when due 
management believes it has adequate resources  or could obtain the needed resources  to manually bill tenants and pay bills until the systems became operational 
the principal risks to the company relating to non information systems at the outlet centers are failure to identify time sensitive systems and inability to find a suitable replacement system 
the company believes that adequate replacement components or new systems are available at reasonable prices and are in good supply 
the company also believes that adequate time and resources are available to remediate these areas as needed 
the principal risks to the company in its relationships with third parties are the failure of third party systems used to conduct business such as tenants being unable to stock stores with merchandise  use cash registers and pay invoices  banks being unable to process receipts and disbursements  vendors being unable to supply needed materials and services to the centers  and processing of outsourced employee payroll 
based on yk compliance work done to date  the company has no reason to believe that key tenants  banks and suppliers will not be yk compliant in all material respects or can not be replaced within an acceptable time frame 
the company will attempt to obtain compliance certification from suppliers of key services as soon as such certifications are available 
contingency plans 
the company intends to deal with contingency planning during the first half of after the results of the above assessments are known 
the company description of its yk compliance issues are based upon information obtained by management through evaluations of internal business systems and from tenant and vendor compliance efforts 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to address the yk issues for all its systems in a timely manner or that it will not encounter unexpected difficulties or significant expenses relating to adequately addressing the yk issue 
if the company or the major tenants or vendors with whom the company does business fail to address their major yk issues  the company s operating results or financial position could be materially adversely affected
