item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview anesta has two products that have been approved by the fda  actiq and fentanyl oralet  and a number of other product candidates in various stages of preclinical and clinical development 
all of these products and product candidates use anesta s proprietary ots for drug delivery 
actiq is indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain 
actiq was approved by the fda in november and its commercial launch is expected in march anesta s first product  fentanyl oralet  was developed for premedication before surgery or painful procedures in monitored anesthesia settings and was approved by the fda in october commercial sales of fentanyl oralet have not been and are not expected to be significant 
abbott is anesta s exclusive partner for the commercialization of actiq and fentanyl oralet in the united states 
abbott manufactures actiq and fentanyl oralet and sells these products to anesta at a price that reflects abbott s cost of manufacturing 
anesta in turn resells these products to abbott at a price related to abbott s selling price to wholesalers and pharmacies 
anesta s gross margin therefore is directly affected by abbott s manufacturing costs and selling price 
abbott also is obligated to pay anesta a small royalty on its sales of actiq and fentanyl oralet  which essentially offsets anesta s royalty obligation to the uurf 
anesta recognizes revenue when abbott ships product against a customer order 
in  anesta reacquired from abbott commercial rights to all ot fentanyl products  including actiq and fentanyl oralet  outside the united states 
anesta intends to commercialize actiq internationally through collaborations with corporate partners 
anesta has entered into collaborations with grupo ferrer for distribution in spain and portugal  and with lafon for distribution in france 
anesta intends to seek additional partners for other major foreign markets 
anesta is pursuing registration of actiq in the united kingdom  the largest cancer pain market in europe  and if that registration is obtained  anesta intends to seek approvals in other european union countries under the european union s mutual recognition process 
anesta has devoted most of its resources since its inception in to the research and development of fentanyl oralet  actiq and other product candidates  as well as the commercialization of fentanyl oralet and preparations for the commercialization of actiq 
anesta  a development stage company  had an accumulated deficit as of december   of approximately million 
results of operations years ended december    and revenues 
total revenues increased by  or during as compared to and decreased by  or during as compared to the increase in is primarily a result of a contract research payment made by abbott upon fda approval of actiq and upfront fees paid by grupo ferrer and lafon upon execution of their collaboration agreements 
the decrease in is primarily a result of the completion of funding by abbott in under a collaborative funding agreement 
operating expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  or during as compared to and decreased by  or during as compared to the increase in is primarily due to expenditures related to activities surrounding the approval of actiq  filing two investigational new drug applications  and manufacturing clinical trial material 
the decrease in is due to higher expenditures in related to clinical research programs and preparation for filing the actiq nda see note to financial statements 
the company expects that its research and development expenses will increase in the future as a result of increased expenses related to the hiring of additional personnel  preclinical studies  clinical trials  product development  manufacturing process development activities and clinical trial material manufacturing 
depreciation expense increased by  or during as compared to and by  or during as compared to the increase in and is due to the company s remodeling of additional facilities 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased by  or during as compared to and by  or during as compared to the increase in and is due primarily to higher expenditures for personnel  corporate development activities  european operations  marketing research  and actiq pre launch marketing activities 
the company expects that its marketing and general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of the increased support required for marketing research  actiq pre launch market development and market launch activities  european operations including international clinical research studies and corporate development activities 
non operating income expense 
interest income decreased by  during as compared to and increased by  during as compared to the decrease in is primarily due to a reduction in the amount of invested funds 
the increase in is primarily due to income earned on the invested net proceeds from the company s secondary offering in june interest expense increased by  during as compared to and by  during as compared to the increase in both years is primarily due to interest expense related to borrowings on the company s revolving term loan 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the years ended december   and relates solely to state income taxes 
the company recognized no tax benefit from its losses in those years 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to its net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards will depend on the generation of future taxable income 
because the company s operations are not currently generating taxable income  the company believes a full valuation allowance should be provided see note to financial statements 
net loss 
as a result of the changes in total revenues  the changes in research and development expenditures and the increase in marketing  general and administrative activities and other factors discussed above  the net loss for was  or per share as compared to  or per share for and  or per share for liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling   in a certificate of deposit used as collateral for a revolving term loan and  in marketable debt securities which are available for sale 
thus cash  cash equivalents  certificate of deposit and marketable debt securities totaled  as of december  in december  the company closed a public offering of  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share resulting in net proceeds to the company of  cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested according to the company s investment policy  which provides guidelines with regard to liquidity and return  and  wherever possible  seeks to minimize the potential effects of concentration of credit risk 
the company s use of cash in operating activities increased by  during as compared to and by  during as compared to the increase in cash used is a direct result of the changes in total revenues  the increase in marketing  general and administrative activities and other factors discussed above 
during  the company made capital expenditures of approximately  as compared to  and  in and respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in was due to the company s remodeling of facilities 
in order to finance the capital expenditures  the company  in january  secured a revolving term loan in the amount of  this loan converted to a year term loan on may  in march  the company borrowed an additional  for a total term loan of  during  the company made principal payments of  and in and  the company made principal payments of  each year 
the loan is collateralized by a  certificate of deposit 
during  the company realized cash proceeds of  relating to the exercise of stock options as compared to  and  in and respectively 
during the company closed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds to the company of  and made principal payments on capital lease obligations of  the company s future capital requirements could be substantial and will depend on  and could increase as a result of  many factors  including the commercial success of actiq  progress of the company s research and development programs  the results and costs of preclinical and clinical testing of the company s products  if developed  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing patents  the time and costs involved in developing and maintaining collaborative research relationships  the costs associated with potential commercialization of its products  and administrative and legal costs 
the company believes that existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet the company s capital needs through at least the end of the company believes that it is prudent to monitor existing cash balances in order to fund the activities which the company believes are necessary to continue its growth 
therefore  the company periodically evaluates market conditions and various financing alternatives for obtaining funds to augment existing cash balances 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems are unable to distinguish between the year and the year this is commonly known as the year yk issue 
as a result  business entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in their business operations 
the company utilizes management information systems and software technology that may be affected by yk issues throughout its business 
the company considers its finance and accounting  clinical database  and laboratory data acquisition and analysis software mission critical 
during fiscal  the company began to implement plans to ensure those systems  along with additional internal and external systems  continue to meet requirements 
the company s information systems group continues to review additional information technology systems and non information technology systems to determine the extent of any changes that may be necessary and believes that there will be minimal changes needed for the company s yk compliance by june  the company has contacted key suppliers and customers regarding their yk compliance to determine any impact on operations 
in general  the suppliers and customers have developed or are in the process of developing plans to address yk issues 
the company will continue to monitor and evaluate the progress of its suppliers and customers on this critical matter 
based on the progress the company has made in addressing its yk issues and the company s plan and timeline to complete its compliance program  the company does not foresee significant risks associated with its yk compliance at this time 
however  the company will continue to discuss yk compliance issues with its key suppliers and customers in an effort to minimize any potential yk compliance impact as it is not possible to guarantee their compliance 
as the company s plan is to address its significant yk issues prior to being affected by them  it has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan 
however  if the company identifies significant risks related to its yk compliance or its progress deviates from the anticipated timeline  the company will develop contingency plans as deemed necessary at that time 
new accounting pronouncements the company has reviewed all recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
based on that review  the company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
risk factors our ability to achieve profitability depends on the successful launch of actiq we must successfully launch actiq together with our us strategic partner abbott to achieve profitability 
although actiq was approved by the fda in november  the commercial success of the product will depend on many factors  including 
abbott s ability to recruit and train a sales force dedicated to actiq  
abbott s ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of actiq while following strict regulatory requirements  
abbott s ability to price actiq at a level that leads to market acceptance  
physicians willingness to prescribe actiq for breakthrough cancer pain  and 
use of actiq by cancer patients who suffer from breakthrough cancer pain 
we do not control any of these factors and cannot assure investors that actiq will be successfully launched 
we  along with abbott  must make every effort through a comprehensive risk management program to reduce the inappropriate use of actiq 
these and other factors that may prevent successful commercialization of actiq are discussed in greater detail in the risk factors that follow 
if actiq is not commercially successful  we will experience significant operating losses and our viability will be dependent upon developing other commercial products 
we depend on abbott to commercialize actiq the success of actiq in the united states depends on the efforts of abbott 
abbott is currently the only approved commercial manufacturer of actiq and abbott has the exclusive right to sell and distribute actiq in the united states 
we do not control how abbott performs its obligations under our collaboration agreement 
abbott may not be able to establish and maintain an effective sales force for actiq 
abbott may terminate the dedicated actiq sales force and sell actiq through its other sales organizations 
some of abbott s existing or future products may compete with actiq and abbott may shift sales and marketing resources to other products 
abbott controls the pricing strategy for actiq  as well as the process of securing the approval of government healthcare authorities  insurance companies and managed care organizations to pay or reimburse for the use of actiq 
abbott has not yet determined the pricing of actiq  and we cannot assure you that abbott will price actiq in a manner that leads to market acceptance 
the manufacturing process for actiq is strictly regulated by the fda and involves certain supplies  such as child resistant product packaging  that involve long lead times 
abbott may not be able to predict or respond to product demand for actiq in a timely manner 
abbott has the right to terminate our collaboration in certain circumstances 
we have limited rights to terminate the abbott alliance  so even if abbott does not perform in a satisfactory manner  we may not be able to seek another partner for actiq in the united states 
we do not currently have adequate resources to distribute or sell actiq on our own 
if abbott does not satisfactorily perform under the collaboration agreement  our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
market acceptance of actiq is uncertain actiq uses a new method of oral transmucosal drug delivery and we cannot assure you that physicians or patients will adopt actiq 
to date  a limited number of clinical trial patients have used actiq  and it is uncertain whether patients will use actiq to treat their breakthrough cancer pain 
physicians will prescribe actiq only if they determine  based on experience  clinical data  and other factors  that it is preferable to other products currently used for breakthrough cancer pain 
recommendations and endorsements by influential physicians will be essential for market acceptance of actiq  and we may not be able to obtain these recommendations and endorsements 
in addition  many other factors influence the adoption of new pharmaceuticals  including marketing and distribution restrictions  adverse publicity  product pricing and reimbursement by third party payors 
third party payors may not agree to reimburse patients for the cost of using actiq 
if actiq does not achieve adequate sales  our business and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive government regulation the fda must approve our new products before they can be marketed in the united states 
before we can file a new drug application nda with the fda  the product candidate must undergo extensive clinical trials 
the regulatory process is expensive and time consuming  and any nda that we submit may not be approved 
our product candidates must also be approved by foreign governments before the product can be sold in other countries as discussed under the heading international commercialization of actiq faces significant obstacles below 
any regulatory approval of a product is limited to specific therapeutic uses for which the product has demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical testing 
in addition  approval may be contingent on post marketing studies 
a pharmaceutical product remains subject to extensive regulation even after approval 
the fda and state regulatory authorities stringently apply and enforce regulatory requirements for drug manufacturing and related activities 
the fda or state regulatory authorities could restrict an approved product or manufacturer  order withdrawal of a product or shut down a manufacturing facility if they discover a significant problem or a violation of applicable regulations 
the fda can impose significant restrictions on the marketing and distribution of approved products 
we have developed with abbott  in consultation with the fda  a comprehensive risk management program for actiq that includes significant restrictions on the manner in which actiq will be marketed and sold 
the program was developed in response to the concerns expressed by the fda in its not approvable letter in november the program is designed to prevent accidental ingestion by children  improper patient selection and diversion or abuse of the product 
developing this program was a time consuming process and delayed the regulatory approval of actiq for approximately one year 
because our future products may also involve the delivery of potent drugs  we may experience similar delays 
any products that we develop in the future will be subject to rigorous regulatory review 
we may not be able to establish that any future products are safe and effective or obtain fda approval 
regulatory concerns or changes could delay or prevent approval of new products 
for example  the fda imposed significant restrictions on abbott s sales and distribution of fentanyl oralet in after it had approved the product 
although these restrictions were relaxed in  we believe those restrictions limited the market acceptance of fentanyl oralet 
as a part of actiq s comprehensive risk management plan  all educational and promotional materials must be submitted to  and reviewed by  the fda 
future restrictions on the marketing or sales of our products could limit sales 
see business government regulation 
our products contain controlled substances the active ingredient in actiq and fentanyl oralet is fentanyl citrate fentanyl  which is a controlled substance regulated by the dea 
fentanyl is listed by the dea as a schedule ii substance  which means that its manufacture  shipment  sale and use is subject to the highest degree of regulation and accountability 
the amount of fentanyl that abbott can obtain is limited by the dea and abbott s quota may not be sufficient to meet potential demand 
future products may also contain substances regulated by the dea 
products containing controlled substances may generate public controversy 
opponents of these products may seek restrictions on marketing and withdrawal of regulatory approval 
in addition  these opponents can generate negative publicity in an effort to bring about rejection of a product by the medical community 
for example  a public interest group attempted to block fda approval of fentanyl oralet 
following fda approval of fentanyl oralet in  the group unsuccessfully urged the fda to withdraw its approval 
political pressures and adverse publicity could lead to delays and increased expenses and limit or restrict the introduction and marketing of our products 
if the fda withdrew the approval of  or placed additional significant restrictions on  the marketing of actiq  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance the testing  marketing and sale of our products involves significant risks 
we may be held liable for adverse reactions resulting from the use of our products 
our products involve a new method of delivery for potent drugs that requires greater precautions to prevent unintended use 
for example  we have worked with abbott to develop a specific risk management program for actiq that is designed to prevent accidental ingestion by children  improper patient selection  diversion and abuse 
the failure of these measures could result in harmful side effects or death 
as a result  consumers  regulatory agencies  pharmaceutical companies or others might make claims against us 
we currently have clinical trial and product liability insurance with aggregate coverage of million 
we will seek to maintain and appropriately increase such insurance coverage as development and commercialization of our products progresses 
insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us from liability claims 
the obligation to pay any product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or the recall of any of our products could adversely affect our financial condition 
we face intense competition and technological change we face intense competition and technological change 
existing and future products  therapies  technological approaches and delivery systems will compete directly with our products 
competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific indication  or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost 
actiq faces competition from inexpensive oral morphine tablets and quick acting intravenous opioid delivery systems 
other technologies are being developed for rapidly delivering opioids to treat breakthrough pain  at least one of which is in clinical trials 
we compete with fully integrated pharmaceutical companies  smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations 
many of these competitors have drug delivery products already approved or in development and operate large  well funded research and development programs in these fields 
our competitors may develop safer or more effective drugs and achieve faster or broader regulatory approval  wider availability of supply  more effective marketing and sales or superior proprietary positions 
any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with development of these products 
international commercialization of actiq faces significant obstacles we plan to commercialize actiq internationally through collaborative relationships with foreign partners 
we have limited foreign regulatory  clinical and commercial resources 
we have entered into relationships with grupo ferrer for spain and portugal and with lafon for france 
these and other potential future partners are critical to our international success 
we may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements with appropriate partners for important foreign markets on acceptable terms  or at all 
existing or future collaborations with foreign partners may not be effective or profitable for us 
we will need to obtain approvals from the appropriate regulatory  pricing and reimbursement authorities to market actiq internationally 
we are conducting clinical trials in the united kingdom and will first seek approval for actiq in the united kingdom and subsequently in other european union countries 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approval for actiq 
pursuing foreign regulatory approvals will be time consuming and expensive 
the regulations can vary among countries and foreign regulatory authorities may require different or additional clinical trials than we conducted to obtain fda approval for actiq 
in addition  adverse clinical trial results  such as death or injury due to side effects  could jeopardize not only foreign regulatory approval  but may also lead to marketing restrictions or product withdrawal in the united states 
actiq may also face foreign regulatory requirements applicable to controlled substances 
foreign collaborative partners may not be effective in their efforts to sell actiq even if regulatory approvals are obtained 
the factors affecting product pricing strategy and availability of reimbursement vary from country to country  and we and our partners may not develop a viable strategy to address these issues 
prevailing practices regarding treatment of cancer pain also differ from country to country  and factors unique to a particular market may prevent or limit market acceptance of actiq 
if we do not establish and maintain effective relationships with foreign collaborative partners  and successfully address the other challenges of foreign markets  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
it may be difficult and expensive to terminate a relationship with a foreign collaborative partner  even if termination is permitted by the collaboration agreement 
doing business abroad involves other risks  including risk of losses or reduced market opportunities due to tariffs  trade barriers  changes in currency exchange rates  export or import controls  restrictions on convertibility of foreign currencies or transfer of funds  and political and economic risks 
furthermore  international intellectual property rights may not be as comprehensive or provide the same level of protection as the us laws 
our ability to develop additional products is uncertain our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop additional commercial products 
while we have conducted clinical trials for ot nicotine and ot etomidate  we have not yet determined that these or other product candidates have medical benefits that justify the significant additional costs that would be necessary to commercialize them 
even if we determine that a product candidate has medical benefits  the cost of commercializing that product candidate may be too high to justify development 
if health insurance companies and other third party payors decide not to reimburse patients for purchasing our products  sales could be severely limited 
in addition  competitors may develop products that are more effective  cost less or are ready for commercial introduction before our products 
if we are unable to develop additional  commercially viable products  our future prospects will be limited 
clinical trials are expensive and uncertain extensive and costly clinical trials must be conducted to demonstrate a product s safety and efficacy before it can be approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
a product candidate that appears to be safe and effective in early testing may not ultimately prove to be safe and effective when tested in a larger number of patients 
we may also encounter problems in a clinical trial that significantly delay or cause us to terminate the clinical trial program 
any adverse clinical event could cause delays or prevent us from commercializing additional products 
limited manufacturing experience we have developed an alternative manufacturing method which we believe could lower costs and increase applicability to a variety of compounds 
we have manufactured ots products for clinical trials using this method 
we intend to apply this new manufacturing method to produce products for foreign markets 
however  we have never manufactured commercial quantities of our products using this or any other method 
we have limited experience with regulatory approval of manufacturing processes 
this new method may prove to be too expensive  complex or unsuited for some applications and may not be approvable by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
we may not be able to develop a manufacturing process that produces adequate amounts of our products at an acceptable cost 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards  which may significantly increase our costs and may even prevent us from making our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand 
if we change our approved manufacturing process  the fda will require a new approval before the process could be used 
failure to develop our manufacturing capabilities may mean that even if we develop promising new products  we may not be able to produce them profitably 
we will need to find corporate partners for our new products to commercialize any of our current product candidates  we will need to establish relationships with corporate partners 
we do not have the sales  marketing  manufacturing or distribution capabilities that would allow us to sell our products alone 
as a result  we will need to develop relationships with companies that have these capabilities to commercialize any new products 
we may not be able to find partners who will agree to sell and distribute our products on favorable terms  or at all 
even if we form corporate partnerships  those relationships may not be advantageous to us for a variety of reasons  including inadequate attention or resource commitments by the partner  management turnover  changing market conditions and competitive developments 
if we are unable to form successful corporate partnerships for a product  we may be unable to commercialize that product profitably 
our success depends on protecting our intellectual property our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and protect patents  maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others in the united states and other countries 
our products are based on us and foreign patents for the ots  which are held by the university of utah and its assignee  uurf 
we have exclusive  world wide licenses to these patents which cover the design and types of pharmaceutical compounds in our products 
our success depends on the continued validity of these patents 
if either we or the uurf fail to file  prosecute or maintain any of the patents  our business could be severely damaged 
we intend to file additional patent applications relating to our technology  products and processes 
we will also direct the uurf to file any additional patent applications relating to the technology we have licensed 
however  any of these patents or patent applications may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by our competitors 
these patents may also fail to provide meaningful competitive advantages to us 
for example  another company may develop a way to deliver potent opioids in a more cost effective manner than our products without infringing on our patents 
intellectual property rights are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may be unknowingly infringing on the proprietary rights of others and may be liable for that infringement  which could result in significant liability for us 
for example  we are not aware of any third party intellectual property rights which would prevent our use of our new manufacturing method  although rights of this type may exist 
we could be forced to either seek a license to intellectual property rights of others or alter our products or processes so that they no longer infringe the proprietary rights of others 
a license could be very expensive to obtain  or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
we are responsible for any patent litigation costs 
if we were to become involved in a dispute regarding intellectual property  whether ours or that of another company  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine who had the claimed rights first 
we may also be forced to seek a judicial determination concerning the rights in question 
these types of proceedings may be costly and time consuming for us  even if we eventually prevail 
if we do not prevail  we might be forced to pay significant damages  obtain a license or stop making a certain product 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and confidentiality provisions in agreements with collaborative partners  employees and consultants to protect our intellectual property 
other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us and we may not be able to adequately enforce our rights against these people 
uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing  reimbursement and healthcare reform measures the availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical product 
these third party payors continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare 
currently  actiq has not been approved for reimbursement by any third party payors 
in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system  and further proposals are likely 
the potential for adoption of these proposals affects our ability to raise capital  obtain additional collaborative partners and market our products 
we could experience pricing pressure on our current and future products due to the trend toward managed health care  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations  and additional legislative proposals 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope 
we have not been profitable and may require additional financing we have not been profitable since our inception in august as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur losses through at least we may never realize significant revenues or be profitable 
factors that will influence our profitability include the success of actiq  the development and commercialization of additional products  timing and difficulty of obtaining regulatory approvals and competition 
most of our funding has come from research and development fees and the sale of stock 
we may have to raise additional funds through collaborative relationships or public and private financings 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by selling equity securities  the share ownership of our existing investors could be diluted or the new equity purchasers may obtain terms that are better than those of our existing investors 
lack of financing may delay  reduce or eliminate some of our programs or force us to relinquish rights to technology  product candidates or products 
we need to attract and retain key employees and consultants and manage growth attracting and retaining qualified employees  consultants and advisors is critical to our success 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in research and development  clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing and marketing 
we compete for qualified individuals with numerous pharmaceutical  health products and biotechnology companies  universities and other research institutions 
we may not be able to attract and retain these types of individuals 
with the approval of actiq and continued development of product candidates  our operations may expand in the future 
any significant growth will place demands on our management and operational resources 
these demands may include hiring additional people  capital improvements and changing relationships with corporate partners 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls 
failure to properly manage our growth could result in loss of market opportunities and materially damage our financial condition 
universities and medical institutions conduct clinical development under agreements with us 
we depend on principal investigators to conduct our clinical development activities 
these collaborators are not our employees and we do not control their activities 
our collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of whom may compete with us 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions which may discourage takeover attempts  including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares 
this may limit stockholders ability to approve a transaction that stockholders may think is in their best interest 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at a properly called meeting of stockholders 
special stockholder meetings may be called only by the board of directors  the chairman of the board or the president 
in addition  the board of directors has the authority  without stockholder action  to fix the rights and preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
highly volatile stock price the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile 
factors affecting our stock price include fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial therapeutic products by us or our competitors  published reports by securities analysts  progress with clinical trials  governmental regulation  changes in reimbursement policies  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  developments in our relationship with collaborative partners  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of our products and general market conditions 
our operations involve hazardous materials our research and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
although we believe that our safety procedures for these materials comply with governmental standards  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  which could exceed our financial resources 
absence of dividends we intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and we do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future
