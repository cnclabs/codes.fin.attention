the company is continuing to pursue various strategic options with respect to metabasis  including the possibility of establishing metabasis as an independent company  selling the business to another pharmaceutical company or other options 
the company s current operating plan includes continued funding of basic research activities at metabasis primarily through collaborations with pfizer and sankyo 
the company s product development efforts with pfizer and sankyo may not be successful  pfizer and sankyo may terminate their respective collaborations and gensia sicor may not be able to find a purchaser for metabasis or establish metabasis as an independent entity 
most of the company s foreign subsidiaries use foreign exchange currency contracts to reduce the negative financial impact of currency fluctuations 
in march  the company s italian subsidiary  sicor  entered into ten monthly us million put options at a strike price of lira  per us as of december   six contracts were exercised 
impact of year the company has taken actions to understand the nature and extent of the work required to make its systems and infrastructure year compliant 
system hardware  software and microprocessor controlled equipment that support the company s infrastructure have been inventoried and assessed for year compliance 
to the extent necessary to address material year issues  the company is in the process of obtaining and installing current releases or upgrades from software vendors 
all domestic business systems have been upgraded and are believed to be compliant 
work continues on the company s international facilities systems 
upgrades and conversions are scheduled for completion by the end of the second quarter of in italy and by the end of the fourth quarter of in mexico 
a failure by the company to convert its international systems in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on the company 
because third party failures could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to conduct business  the company is attempting to obtain written assurances from all material customers and vendors that their systems are or will be year compliant 
the company has received such assurances from its domestic material customers and vendors  however  this is an on going process 
the company anticipates that this process will be completed by mid for its international operations 
the company s total sales to international customers in the year ended december  were approximately million  which represented approximately of the company s total sales in such period 
one customer  the mexican hospital program  accounted for approximately million of sales  or of the company s sales 
no other international customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in the year ended december  if either the company or any material customer or vendor experiences a failure of any critical system  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s business or require the company to incur unanticipated expenses 
if by mid  the company has not obtained reasonable assurances from material vendors as to year compliance  the company will consider alternatives  including the replacement of material vendors  if possible 
the business interruption of any of the company s significant customers  resulting from their year issues  could have a material adverse impact on the company s revenues and results of operations 
the company has not completed a formal contingency plan for non compliance  but it is developing a plan based on the information obtained from third parties and an on going evaluation of the company s own systems 
the company anticipates having a contingency plan in place by mid which will include development of backup procedures  identification of alternate suppliers and possible increases in inventory levels 
the company has not identified its most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to possible losses in connection with year related problems 
the company plans on completing this analysis in mid there are many factors outside the company s control that could cause the year problem to seriously disrupt its operations 
there are risks  however  for which the company is preparing and  in so doing  seeking to reduce its exposure 
the scope of the company s efforts regarding each risk is limited to the company s key products  key compounds  subsidiaries  critical suppliers  and major customers 
the most critical of these risks are a disruption in the supply of product with particular emphasis on failures of raw material suppliers  commercial partners  and external distribution channels internal infrastructure failures such as utilities  communications  internal information technology services and integrated information technology systems non us government failures  especially as they impact import and export activity interruption of the product regulatory filing process a major customer failure or interruption 
the cost incurred through december   for the year transition was approximately million  which includes software and hardware upgrades that would have been purchased in the normal course of business to meet the future growth and worldwide integration 
the company estimates that the remaining costs to be incurred on upgrading systems  including the year transition  will be approximately million  and as such will not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or operating results 
based on available information  including assurances from software vendors that their products are compliant  the company believes that  barring critical failures arising from factors beyond the company s direct control  it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material adverse effect on its business operations  products  operating results or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk with respect to its debt outstanding and foreign currency transactions 
most of the company s long term borrowings are based on fixed interest rates and therefore not subject to material risk from changes in interest rates 
short term borrowings  however  are based on prime or other indicative base rates plus a premium 
if these indicative base rates increase  the company will incur higher relative interest expense and similarly  a decrease in the rates will reduce relative interest expense 
in recent years  there have not been significant fluctuations in the prime or other indicative base rates 
a change in the prime rate or other indicative base rates would not materially change interest expense assuming levels of debt consistent with historical amounts 
due to the company s international operations  certain transactions are conducted in foreign currencies 
the company s italian operations hedge against transactional risks by borrowing against its receivables and against economic risk by buying monthly call options to strike at a rate equal to or above the budgeted exchange rate
