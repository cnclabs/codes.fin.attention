item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview 
pacificare sells hmo and hmo related products primarily to members in two groups the secure horizons program for medicare beneficiaries and the commercial programs for members of employer groups and individuals 
our specialty managed care hmos and hmo related products and services supplement our commercial programs 
these include behavioral health services  life and health insurance  dental and vision services and pharmacy benefit management 
events significant to our business that occurred during included in november  we announced our intention to sell our utah hmo and workers compensation subsidiaries 
we sold our utah hmo subsidiary on september   and our workers compensation subsidiary on october  in july  fpa  one of our contracted health care providers  declared bankruptcy 
as a result  we terminated all of our fpa contracts 
significant provider insolvency reserves were recognized in in december  we recognized net pretax credits related to preliminary favorable settlements of opm claims 
during  we borrowed million to repurchase shares of our common stock and repaid million of the outstanding balance on our credit facility 
in january  our board of directors approved a plan to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock 
during  we repurchased  shares for an aggregate amount of million 
in june  substantially all of our million shares of series a preferred stock were converted to million shares of class b common stock 
in  with the sale of our utah hmo  we exited the medicaid line of business 
the information below includes both the medicare and medicaid line of business as part of the government program for the and prior periods presented 
compared with membership 
total membership decreased seven percent to approximately million members at december   from approximately million members at december  the disposition of utah accounted for percent of the membership decline 
california contributed percent of the decline as we continue to emphasize renewing commercial contracts with sufficient price increases to improve gross margin 
this decline was consistent with our shift in strategic focus from rapid growth to improved margin performance 
the remaining nine percent was attributable to our exit of certain rural counties  where government and commercial premiums were neither sufficient to support the cost of health care nor our profitability requirements 
government membership declined three percent year over year 
commercial membership decreased nine percent from premium revenue 
during  premium revenue increased five percent from the prior year  primarily due to six additional weeks of results in from the fhp acquisition 
discontinued indemnity and workers compensation products that were not meeting profitability expectations partially offset this increase 
government premiums increased seven percent or million over the prior year as a result of increases of million from the inclusion of six additional weeks of results in from the fhp acquisition  increases of million from premium rate increases that averaged approximately four percent  offset by decreases of million from net membership losses caused by our exit of certain rural geographic areas and medicaid lines of business primarily in california  utah and texas 
commercial premiums increased three percent or million over the prior year 
the net increase was due to increases of million from the inclusion of six additional weeks of results in from the fhp acquisition  increases of million from premium rate increases that averaged approximately five percent  offset by decreases of million from net membership losses caused by our disposition of utah and by our premium rate increases primarily in california  oklahoma and ohio  and decreases of million  primarily from discontinued indemnity and workers compensation products 
other income 
other income increased percent in from the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from prescription solutions and shusa 
consolidated medical care ratio and provider insolvency reserves 
the consolidated medical care ratio health care services as a percentage of premium revenue declined by percent compared to the improved commercial product performance was partially offset by increased provider insolvency reserves 
excluding these reserves  the consolidated medical care ratio was percent 
provider insolvency reserves were immaterial in and totaled million in as follows quarter government commercial total in millions first second third fourth total provider insolvency reserves include the write offs of the providers uncollectable receivables and estimated cost of unpaid health care claims covered by our capitation payment 
depending on state law  we may be held liable for unpaid health care claims  which were the responsibility of the capitated provider 
the majority of the insolvency reserves relate to specific provider bankruptcies 
however  the estimate also includes reserves for potentially insolvent providers  where conditions indicate claims are not being paid or have slowed considerably 
fpa declared bankruptcy in july fpa served approximately  pacificare members in arizona  california  nevada and texas 
reserves for the fpa bankruptcy totaled million  with million attributable to our nevada hmo 
nevada law specifically requires that we pay all health care services claims for our members including those previously covered by capitation payments 
the second quarter fpa insolvency reserves were partially offset by unrelated favorable provider settlements 
we periodically make changes in estimates as prior year contract issues are resolved 
increases to fpa reserves were made in the third and fourth quarters as additional claims information was presented for payment 
the remaining fpa reserves of million primarily relate to non contracted claims and receivable write offs in the remaining hmos 
unpaid fpa reserves at december  were approximately million 
reserves for other providers totaled million 
approximately million of the reserves recognized in the third and fourth quarters related to another provider that has ceased paying claims in nevada and arizona 
this provider has not declared bankruptcy 
the membership was transitioned to other providers between december and january the remaining million is the estimated liability for smaller bankrupt providers and potentially insolvent providers  primarily in california 
other provider insolvency reserves unpaid at december  were approximately million 
government medical care ratio 
the government medical care ratio for the year ended december  increased percent compared to the prior year because we recognized million of provider insolvency reserves 
government insolvency reserves for fpa were million  with the majority of these charges recognized in the second and third quarters 
other provider insolvency reserves of million were recorded  primarily in the fourth quarter 
higher costs incurred for fpa membership shifted into new provider relationships were offset by the disposition of utah 
excluding government provider insolvency reserves  the government medical care ratio was percent 
commercial medical care ratio 
the commercial medical care ratio includes the specialty hmos and indemnity insurance results 
the commercial medical care ratio for the year ended december  decreased due to the following improved provider contracts  a favorable pricing environment  improved performance from the specialty hmos  sale of our utah hmo and workers compensation subsidiaries  offset by provider insolvency reserves of million 
commercial insolvency reserves for fpa totaled million  primarily recognized in the second and third quarters 
other provider insolvency reserves of million were recognized in the fourth quarter and related to arizona  california  nevada  texas and washington 
excluding commercial provider insolvency reserves  the commercial medical care ratio was percent 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of operating revenue  marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly compared to the prior year because we realized the benefits of restructuring and a full year of synergies as a result of the fhp acquisition 
pretax charges 
the following is a summary of our net pretax charges quarter pretax net of tax diluted loss recognized charge credit amount earnings per share dollars in millions  except per share data sale of utah hmo and workers compensation subsidiaries third opm charges third total third opm credits fourth impairment of long lived assets utah hmo fourth washington health plan fourth discontinued workers compensation products fourth total impairment of long lived assets loss contracts fourth restructuring fourth see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognized million of net pretax charges in  primarily for dispositions of unprofitable operations 
favorable opm settlements in the fourth quarter offset increased reserves recognized in the third quarter 
in  utah  washington and the workers compensation subsidiary charges related to the impairment of goodwill 
restructuring reserves recognized in were spent in net investment income 
net investment income increased approximately percent in compared to the prior year  due primarily to gains on sales of marketable securities experienced throughout and more efficient investment through account consolidation 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased approximately six percent in compared to the prior year  due to continued repayment of our credit facility and declining interest rates 
the decrease was partially offset by interest on the fhp acquisition borrowings that were outstanding for six weeks longer in provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was percent in  compared with percent in the rate declined significantly for two reasons the effective rate was disproportionately high because most of the pretax charges recorded in the fourth quarter of were not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective income tax rate without the effect of the pretax charges was approximately percent 
nondeductible goodwill amortization was a smaller percentage of taxable income 
diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   income excluding the pretax charges described above was million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   income excluding the pretax charges was million or diluted earnings per share 
the increase in income was due to increased other income  improved commercial medical care ratio  efficiency in marketing  general and administrative expenses  increased investment income  and decreased interest expense 
compared with overview 
in  we began reporting on calendar year end 
we previously reported a fiscal year ending september this resulted in an audited transition period from october  to december  for clarity of presentation and comparability  the discussion of results of operations compares the year ended december  to the unaudited twelve months ended december   which is referred to as the prior year 
on february   we finalized the fhp acquisition for a total purchase price  including transaction costs  of billion 
the fhp acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
our consolidated results of operations include the results of fhp from the date of the fhp acquisition 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
membership 
total membership increased percent to approximately million members at december   from approximately million members at december  the fhp acquisition increased membership by approximately million government members and million commercial members 
premium revenue 
during  total premium revenue increased percent from the prior year  a direct result of the fhp acquisition 
six percent of the increase in premiums resulted from enrollment gains net of the fhp acquisition in both government and commercial programs 
the remainder of the premium increase was mainly attributable to the government programs  along with our specialty managed care products and services 
government premiums in increased percent compared to the prior year 
approximately percent of the total increase was due to the fhp acquisition 
the balance of the net increase was due to the following hcfa premium rate increases effective january  averaging over six percent  increased government per member premium rates due to our exit of medicaid lines of business in certain markets that had lower average per member premiums  lower member paid supplemental premiums in several of our markets  and enrollment gains in the government programs  net of acquisition membership 
commercial premiums increased percent compared to the prior year 
approximately percent of the total increase related to the fhp acquisition 
the remainder of the net increase was due to the following enrollment gains in the commercial programs  net of acquisition membership  accounted for seven percent  while premium rates remained relatively flat  offset by decreased membership growth  excluding the fhp acquisition  due to the sale of our florida operations and a shift in focus from one of rapid growth to improved profit margins through the use of a more disciplined product pricing strategy 
consolidated medical care ratio 
the consolidated medical care ratio increased percent from the prior year as a result of higher fhp commercial costs 
the government medical care ratio for the year ended december  remained flat compared to the prior year 
this consistency was largely due to fhp  which had lower cost provider contracts and generally higher reimbursement for medicare membership 
additionally  the wind down of the medicaid business contributed to slight decreases in the government medical care ratio 
these decreases were partially offset by enhanced prescription drug benefits provided to enrollees combined with lower member paid supplemental premiums 
the increase in the commercial medical care ratio included higher cost fhp provider contracts  increased non capitated physician costs and increased out of area emergency room costs compared to the prior year 
the commercial medical care ratio includes the specialty managed care health care costs 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of operating revenue  marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly compared to the prior year 
these cost savings were caused by lower than expected staffing  and greater than expected efficiencies resulting from the integration of the fhp administrative functions and information systems 
pretax charges 
the following is a summary of our pretax charges quarter pretax net of tax diluted loss recognized charge credit amount earnings per share dollars in millions  except per share data impairment of long lived assets utah hmo fourth washington health plan fourth discontinued workers compensation products fourth total impairment of long lived assets loss contracts fourth restructuring fourth opm charges second florida disposition second restructuring second total second impairment of long lived assets florida third see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognized million of pretax charges in  million related to the write off of goodwill for our utah and washington hmos and our workers compensation subsidiary 
in  we recognized florida goodwill impairment of million plus million of opm  restructuring and florida disposition losses 
restructuring reserves recognized in were spent in and net investment income 
net investment income increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to additional investments over the prior year because of the fhp acquisition 
interest expense 
interest expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was due to increased borrowings on our credit facility to finance the fhp acquisition 
provision for income taxes 
the majority of the pretax charges were not deductible for income tax purposes 
therefore  we did not record an income tax benefit for most of these charges 
the magnitude of these charges  combined with the inability to record a related income tax benefit  resulted in a disproportionately high effective income tax rate 
the effective income tax rate  without the effect of the pretax charges  was approximately percent  an increase over the prior year 
this increase reflected the additional goodwill amortization expense attributed to the fhp acquisition 
diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   income excluding the pretax charges described above was million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   income excluding pretax charges was million or diluted earnings per share 
the decrease over the prior year was due to increases in the following commercial medical care ratio  amortization expense  interest expense related to the fhp acquisition  and increased shares used to calculate earnings per share 
the convertible preferred stock and potentially dilutive securities including stock options used to calculate diluted loss per share in the fourth quarter and for were anti dilutive 
anti dilution results when diluted earnings per share is a greater value than basic earnings per share 
the net loss per share reported in was due mainly to the pretax charges recognized in the fourth quarter and the high effective tax rate 
because the actual diluted loss per share was less than the basic loss per share  the calculation of the diluted loss per share reported was equal to the basic loss per share 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows in pacificare s consolidated cash  equivalents and marketable securities increased to billion at december  from billion at december  the combined increase in cash  equivalents and marketable securities was directly related to current year earnings that were invested 
this increase was partially offset by long term debt principal payments 
cash flows from operations increased by million to million in from million in as follows increases of million in net income  offset by decreases of million in impairment  disposition  restructuring and other charges  and net decreases of million  primarily related to changes in deferred income taxes 
investing activities in net cash used in investing activities was million in purchases of property  plant and equipment of million were offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
in  we sold several medical clinics and related personal property acquired in the fhp acquisition 
disposition proceeds were approximately million and were offset by increased investments in all marketable securities totaling million 
investing activities in net cash used by investing activities in was billion for the acquisition of fhp 
the proceeds from the subsidiary dispositions and property  plant and equipment in were million 
this was offset by million of property  plant and equipment purchases and million of marketable securities purchases  including restricted 
financing activities in financing activities used million of cash in  primarily because we paid million on our credit facility and other notes during the year 
we also borrowed million under the credit facility to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our class a and class b common stock for million 
cash received for the issuance of common and treasury stock was million and was partially offset by million of preferred stock dividends and cash paid on redemption of preferred stock 
financing activities in in  our financing activities provided million of cash 
of the million of cash  million was the net effect of borrowing billion under our credit facility to finance the fhp acquisition  offset by million of credit facility payments in proceeds from the issuance of common stock provided million of cash in while preferred stock dividend payments used million of cash 
finally  in the first quarter of  we made capital contributions totaling million to talbert medical management corporation  a former subsidiary of fhp 
in the second quarter of  we received million from the sale of the talbert stock 
other balance sheet change explanations receivables  net 
receivables  net decreased by million from as follows million increase in provider and pharmacy rebate receivables  offset by million decrease in premiums and reinsurance receivables  million decrease for subsidiary dispositions and discontinued indemnity products  and million decrease in other receivables  including the timing of net investment income receivable 
provider receivables increased by million 
in  we reduced the claims payable backlog from days at the beginning of the year to days at the end of the year 
accelerated claims payments often result in provider receivables that are collected through capitation withhold adjustments and other incentive settlements 
pharmacy rebate receivables increased by million as prescription drug utilization increased 
premium receivables decreased million 
improved collection efforts in california and oregon contributed million of the decrease 
outstanding reinsurance receivables declined by million in goodwill and intangible assets  net 
goodwill and intangible assets decreased by million from as follows million of goodwill and intangible amortization expense  and million for fhp acquisition exit costs in excess of original estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
medical claims and benefits payable 
medical claims and benefits payable decreased by million from as follows million increase in provider insolvency reserves  million increase in provider capitation liabilities  offset by million decrease in claims payable  both our risk and claims administered on behalf of providers  and million decrease for dispositions  including utah s loss contract reserves  and discontinued indemnity products 
claims payable decreased as our claims inventory fell by percent from the december level 
accounts payable 
we experienced a million decline in accounts payable at december  compared to the prior year 
this decrease was planned and is related to accounts payable systems changes effective january  we made an effort to decrease accounts payable inventory to ease the number of items that would be converted in the reorganization of the accounts payable system 
income taxes 
income taxes changed from a receivable in the prior year to a payable in the change was attributable to the income tax provision on the income  partially offset by the estimated income tax payments made during the year 
other liabilities 
other liabilities decreased by million from the decrease was primarily attributable to the disposition of our workers compensation subsidiary 
forward looking information under the private securities litigation act of the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the act was designed to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves without fear of litigation 
the prospective information must be identified as forward looking and must be accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statements 
the statements about our plans  strategies  intentions  expectations and prospects contained throughout the document are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially from those predicted as of the date of this report in the forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in addition  past financial performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends 
stockholders are also directed to the other risks discussed in other documents filed by pacificare with the securities and exchange commission 
membership 
we expect government membership to increase three to four percent by december  compared to for  we plan to expand our membership retention programs and target group retiree members in our existing markets 
we expect membership increases from enhanced drug benefits and new enrollment as competitors exit markets in which secure horizons will remain 
we also anticipate offering our secure horizon programs in new geographic markets 
these increases will be partially offset by the exit of rural markets 
we expect commercial membership for the year ended december  to increase four to five percent compared to the majority of the growth will be in california where we plan to strengthen our sales fundamentals  streamline and enhance our product mix  improve underwriting practices  increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our distribution channels  and maximize membership renewal growth opportunities 
membership risk factors 
an unforeseen loss of profitable membership could have an effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers  the effect of premium increases  reductions in work force by existing customers  negative publicity and news coverage  inability of marketing and sales plans to attract new customers  or the loss of key executives or key employees 
premiums 
effective january   we received medicare premium rate increases of two percent 
we expect to continue to improve our gross margin by renewing commercial employer contracts with price increases 
the price increases in our commercial product line are expected to range from zero to percent depending upon competition  employer size  benefit design  geographic market and other factors 
we plan to exit markets where our premium revenue does not cover the cost of providing care 
while we expect to increase commercial premiums without experiencing significant membership losses  we may have to alter our pricing strategy to avoid such losses 
reduction in medicare premiums  such as the proposed risk adjusted payment program  could have an effect on our financial position as every one percent change in premium represents approximately million dollars of annual revenue 
to counteract this impact  we would need to generate additional revenue or cost savings of approximately per person per year 
we could achieve this by increasing member premiums  office copayments  hospital deductibles or prescription copayments 
other income 
in  we expect other income to be lower than because of lower shusa revenues 
in addition  rental income is expected to be less than because several medical clinics were sold in the last half of health care provider contracts 
our profitability depends  in part  on our ability to control health care costs while providing quality care 
maintaining capitated arrangements with solvent providers  especially in the nevada market  will be important to improve results of operations 
securing cost effective contracts with existing and new physician groups has become more difficult due to increased competition 
failure to secure cost effective contracts may result in a loss in membership or a higher medical care ratio 
additionally  the negotiation of provider contracts  generally as of january  may be impacted by unfavorable state and federal legislation and regulation discussed below 
our inability to contract with providers  loss of contracts with providers  inability of providers to provide adequate care  or insolvency of providers could materially affect us 
based on current information  we believe that our contingency plans are adequate to cover the potential impact of contract terminations 
we continue to evaluate the financial stability of our providers  focusing on providers with significant membership in key geographic areas and providers that have been identified as a poor risk 
we are also seeking to improve our performance in by taking steps to minimize our risk associated with providers 
we believe that the december  provider insolvency reserves are adequate to cover the cost of health care services rendered through that may not be paid by insolvent or unstable providers 
we believe our contingency plans for shifting the membership or assisting the provider to obtain and maintain stability are adequate to cover the risk 
we have and may continue to incur additional costs as a result of entering into new contracts  especially for fpa and potentially for medpartners 
the effect of these risks and the need for additional provider reserves could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
we believe  however  that such reserves would not materially affect our consolidated financial position 
government medical care ratio 
we expect the government medical care ratio in to remain flat or slightly increase from price increases  recontracting efforts in nevada and california  and our exit of rural markets in four states plus the disposition of utah are expected to improve the medical care ratio 
however  these improvements will be offset by changes in premium mix  increases in capitation  decreases in non capitated contracts and changes in pharmacy costs 
the implementation of the medicare reform provisions that limit program spending and allow the entry of new providers and plans that could increase competitive pressures could also offset any increases 
see legislation and regulation below 
commercial medical care ratio 
in  we expect the commercial medical care ratio to be consistent with  or improve slightly from we expect improvements as we continue to renegotiate provider contracts and implement capitated contracts and price increases 
moreover  higher premium rates offered during renewal periods should continue to result in the elimination of some high medical care ratio business 
we also plan to exit markets where price increases do not cover the cost of health care 
medical care risk factors 
the government and commercial medical care ratio expectations discussed above could be affected by various uncertainties  including medical and prescription drug costs that have been rising faster than premium increases  increases in utilization and costs of medical services  the effect of actions by competitors or groups of providers  or termination of provider contracts  provider insolvency or renegotiation of such contracts at less cost effective rates or terms of payment 
marketing  general and administrative support 
in  marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue are expected to decline slightly because we expect to realize additional efficiencies from the fhp acquisition 
additionally  california s final conversion from fhp information systems to pacificare systems was completed in june  so will be the first full year of integrated operations 
the need for additional advertising  marketing  administrative  or management information systems expenditures  and the inability of marketing and sales plans to attract new customers  could impact marketing  general and administrative expenses 
dispositions 
dispositions could be announced as we continue to evaluate whether certain subsidiaries or products fit within our core business strategy 
there can be no assurance that the dispositions will not result in additional pretax charges 
we believe  however  that any disposition operating losses would not materially affect our consolidated financial position 
however  the disposition losses could have a material effect on the results of operations or cash flows of a future period 
impairment of long lived assets 
as circumstances warrant  we determine whether the realizable value of long lived assets such as property and equipment  real estate and goodwill  are less than the value carried on the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that any impairment of such long lived assets would not materially affect our consolidated financial position 
however  impairment charges  if material  could have an effect on our results of operations or cash flows of a future period 
effective tax rate 
we expect the effective tax rate to decrease three to five percent from consistent with our integration strategies  we will complete a legal reorganization of the company and its subsidiaries 
the full year benefit of certain tax strategies is expected to be realized in the tax strategies are expected to reduce the effective tax rate by one to three percent 
the effective tax rate includes more than one percent related to the dispositions of utah and the workers compensation subsidiary that is not expected to recur 
finally  the impact of nondeductible goodwill on the effective tax rate is expected to decrease by approximately one percent because pretax income is projected to increase from there can be no assurance that these tax strategies will be successful or that pre tax income will increase as projected  for various reasons set forth in this document and other documents we have filed with the securities and exchange commission 
as a result  there can be no assurance our tax rate will decrease in year pacificare has implemented a year compliance program to address all major computing information systems  including core application systems  networks  desktop systems  infrastructure  and critical information supply chains 
in addition to all major information systems  we are verifying that all date fields and calculations used in critical business processes will be year compliant 
under the program we are also addressing our external year related risks which arise from the year readiness of third parties with whom we maintain ongoing relationships 
the year compliance program includes the following five phases which are listed in logical order  but are being addressed concurrently as appropriate awareness and communication 
there is an on going company wide communication and education effort to ensure that there is a clear understanding of the year problem and associated risks 
inventory and assessment 
a company wide inventory has been taken of all computer information systems and their components  including infrastructure equipment and hardware  software applications and information supply chains 
through the inventory  we are assessing the business risks and year compliance status of each system component 
for components which are not year compliant  a remediation plan is being developed which includes the year remediation action required and the time and resources needed to accomplish it 
priorities are also established based on the relative business critical function of each system component 
remediation 
based upon the remediation plan developed as part of the assessment phase  appropriate action is taken to correct or remediate the year issues associated with the system and its components to render it year compliant 
except for the fhp core system  we expect all affected system components to be remediated by march  contingency plans for critical business functions will be completed as part of this phase as well 
testing and certification 
following the completion of the remediation phase  each computer information system and its components are tested 
actual test results are reviewed and compared to expected test results based on accepted industry standards and methodologies 
if the actual test results are acceptable  the system and or component are certified as year compliant 
testing and certification for the pacificare core computer system are percent complete 
we expect all other systems except the fhp core system to be tested and certified as year compliant by june  testing and certification of the fhp core computer systems will occur during and are expected to be completed in december implementation and close 
there will be a final review and confirmation that the remediated systems and components have met all year compliance objectives 
when our year compliance program was first established in  we focused on existing systems and did not contemplate acquisitions of other companies 
these core computing programs became year compliant in the total cost to make our pre fhp core computing information systems year compliant was approximately million 
with the february fhp acquisition  we originally expected the arizona  colorado  nevada and ohio hmos to shift to our pre fhp core computing information systems throughout and as providers moved to delegated capitation arrangements 
in the second quarter of  we determined that while we had successfully moved some of these providers to capitation arrangements  the provider networks did not have sufficient infrastructure to administer the claims under a fully delegated capitated arrangement 
we concluded that our hmos in these states will need to continue to administer claims on behalf of providers 
because the claims based fhp core systems function more effectively than our core computing systems for claims administration on behalf of non delegated delivery systems  we decided to maintain the fhp systems 
as a result  the scope of our year compliance activities was expanded to include the fhp computer system 
we have a detailed project plan for modifying the fhp systems to be year compliant in phases during based upon an outside consultant s recommendations and internal analysis  we estimate that the total cost to make the fhp systems year compliant ranges from to million 
our year compliance program establishes priorities to achieve resolution of the most business critical issues first 
the program incorporates a regular reporting process which helps us to monitor and measure our progress toward year compliance against defined goals 
through this reporting process we can focus resources on  any year issue  as necessary 
we are also contacting our third party vendors  provider and hospital networks  business partners  contractors  and service providers  including hcfa  to assess their year level of readiness 
in some cases  we are seeking reasonable assurances with respect to year compliance 
our priority is to assess the readiness of our providers with delegated responsibility and other third parties with which we electronically exchange data or interact 
because we do not control the products  services  or systems of our providers  vendors or customers  we cannot ensure their year compliance 
we anticipate developing business process contingency plans by june for external sources that appear to be at risk 
if hcfa or certain other third parties experience significant failures or erroneous applications  it could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  and business prospects 
for example  if hcfa  opm  or our commercial customers experience system failures  this could cause a delay in our receipt of payments from these customers  including a significant hcfa payment due in january therefore  we are developing a cash receipts contingency plan 
we also could have difficulties processing medicare and other claims within required periods  collecting accurate claims and other data on which we depend  or enrolling new members 
in preparing contingency plans  we are developing risk reduction strategies 
however  some risks may be beyond our control 
further  our marketing  general and administrative expenses could increase due to year compliance expenditures 
opm 
opm generally audits health plans which it contracts with every five or six years 
we currently have several audits with opm that are in various stages 
we intend to negotiate with opm and doj on all unresolved matters to attain a mutually satisfactory result 
we cannot assure that the negotiations will conclude satisfactorily  or that there will not be additional liability upon completion of the audits 
however  we believe that any ultimate liability in excess of amounts already set aside would not materially affect our consolidated financial position 
the liability  if material  could have an effect on results of operations or cash flows of a future quarter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources 
additional borrowings on our credit facility may be necessary if hcfa and opm are unable to remit funds as a result of year compliance issues 
we also may continue to repurchase shares of outstanding stock  resulting in reduced cash or additional borrowings on our credit facility 
additional borrowings on the credit facility may make us subject to earlier mandatory reduction of the outstanding balance 
additionally  should the credit facility be drawn  our ability to repay amounts owed under the credit facility and other long term debt will depend on cash receipts from our subsidiaries restricted cash reserves 
these subsidiary receipts represent fees for management services rendered by us to the subsidiaries and cash dividends by the subsidiaries to us 
nearly all of the subsidiaries are subject to hmo regulations or insurance regulations and may be subject to substantial supervision by one or more hmo or insurance regulators 
subsidiaries subject to regulation must meet or exceed various capital standards imposed by hmo or insurance regulations  which may from time to time impact the amount of funds the subsidiaries can pay to us 
additionally  from time to time  we advance funds in the form of a loan or capital contribution to our subsidiaries to assist them in satisfying federal or state financial requirements 
if a federal or state regulator has concerns about the financial position of a subsidiary  a regulator may impose additional financial requirements on the subsidiary  which may require additional funding from us 
we believe that cash flows from operations  existing cash equivalents  marketable securities and other financing sources will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the credit facility 
risk based capital requirements 
the national association of insurance commissioners has proposed that states adopt risk based capital standards that  if implemented  would require new minimum capitalization limits for health care coverage provided by hmos and other risk bearing health care entities 
to date  washington is the only state where we have hmo operations that has adopted these standards 
we do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position in the near future if other states where we operate hmos adopt these standards 
further  we believe that cash flows from operations or  if necessary  borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund any additional risk based capital requirements 
legislation and regulation 
federal and state legislation and regulation significantly affect us 
during our government programs  the majority of which are medicare business  contribute percent of our revenue and an even greater percentage of our profits 
changes in state and federal legislation or regulation could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results discussed throughout this document 
changes that could effect us materially include limitations on premium levels  increases in minimum capital and reserves and other financial viability requirements  prohibition or limitation of capitated arrangements or provider financial incentives  benefit mandates including mandatory length of stay and emergency room coverage  many of which become effective in  limitations on the ability to manage care and utilization of any willing provider and direct access laws  and adoption on the federal and or state level of a patients bill of rights 
legislation and regulation could also include adverse actions of governmental payors  including reduced medicare premiums  discontinuance of or limitation on governmentally funded programs  recovery by governmental payors of previously paid amounts  the inability to increase premiums or prospective or retroactive reductions to premium rates for federal employees  and adverse regulatory actions
