management s discussion and analysis 
overview percent change from prior year thousands except per share amounts operating revenues    earnings available for common stock    average shares outstanding    earnings per average common share earnings per average common share assuming dilution dividends paid per share the following discussion and analysis presents factors which had a material effect on the operations and financial position of oge energy corp 
the company and its subsidiaries oklahoma gas and electric company og e  enogex inc and its subsidiaries enogex and origen inc 
and its subsidiaries origen during the last three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
average shares outstanding and all per share amounts have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split that occurred in june trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant 
the company became the parent company of og e and og e s former subsidiary  enogex  on december   in a corporate reorganization whereby all common stock of og e was exchanged on a share for share basis for common stock of the company 
prior to december   the company had no operations and the financial results discussed herein for essentially represent the consolidated statements of og e  and comparisons to the results represent comparisons to the consolidated results of og e 
under this corporate structure  the company serves as the parent holding company to og e  enogex  origen and any other companies that may be formed within the organization in the future 
this holding company structure is intended to provide greater flexibility  allowing the company to take advantage of opportunities in an increasingly competitive business environment and to clearly separate the company s electric utility business from its non utility businesses 
because og e is the company s principal subsidiary  the company s financial results and condition are substantially dependent at this time on the financial results and condition of og e 
earnings for increased percent from per share in to per share in the increase was primarily the result of higher revenues at og e due to warmer weather  the generation efficiency performance rider gep rider  higher margin sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales  customer growth and lower operation and maintenance expense 
the increase in earnings was partially offset by lower earnings at enogex and origen 
the gep rider allows og e to retain part of the fuel savings achieved through cost efficiencies and is discussed in more detail below 
the decrease from per share to per share resulted primarily from the million annual reduction in og e s electric rates that became effective in march  slightly lower earnings by enogex and a loss by origen  the company s new non regulated subsidiary  during its first year of operation 
the decrease in earnings was partially offset by the gep rider  customer growth in the og e service area and lower interest costs 
the dividend payout ratio expressed as a percentage of earnings available for common decreased to percent or percent weather adjusted in from percent in the company s goal is to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately percent based on the current business environment 
the company s regulated utility business has been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility industry 
significant changes already have occurred in the wholesale electric markets at the federal level 
in oklahoma  legislation was passed in to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric industry with the goal to provide retail customers with the ability to choose their generation suppliers by june  the arkansas public service commission apsc has initiated proceedings to consider the implementation of a competitive retail market in arkansas 
these developments are described in more detail below under regulation  competition 
in  the company decided upon an enterprise wide software system  which is year ready 
enterprise software is a corporate software system designed to handle most of the company s information processing needs and to improve work processes throughout the company 
the enterprise software system was successfully implemented throughout the company on january  and is expected to significantly enhance the company s abilities in the more competitive years ahead 
except for the historical statements contained herein  the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis  are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate  estimate  objective  possible  potential and similar expressions 
actual results may vary materially 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  business conditions in the energy industry  competitive factors  unusual weather  regulatory decisions  and the other risk factors listed in the reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations revenues percent change from prior year thousands sales of electricity to og e customers    sales of electricity to other utilities 
   enogex    origen total operating revenues    system kilowatt hour sales    kilowatt hour sales to other utilities    total kilowatt hour sales    in  approximately percent of the company s revenues consisted of regulated sales of electricity as a public utility  while the remaining percent were provided primarily by the non utility operations of enogex 
revenues from sales of electricity are somewhat seasonal  with a large portion of the company s annual electric revenues occurring during the summer months when the electricity needs of its customers increase 
enogex s primary operations consist of gathering and processing natural gas  producing natural gas liquids  transporting natural gas through its pipelines in oklahoma and arkansas for various customers including og e  marketing electricity  natural gas and natural gas liquids and investing in the drilling for and production of crude oil and natural gas 
origen s operations remained immaterial to the company during the company continues to evaluate the existing business lines of origen which to date has consisted of geothermal design and engineering and potential new ventures for origen 
actions of the regulatory commissions that set og e s electric rates will continue to affect the company s financial results 
the commissions also have the authority to examine the appropriateness of og e s recovery from its customers of fuel costs  which include the transportation fees that og e pays enogex for transporting natural gas to og e s generating units 
see regulation  competition and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of the oklahoma corporation commission occ rate order dated february   on these transportation fees 
operating revenues increased million or percent during  primarily due to a significant increase in revenue from og e and enogex 
in  og e revenues increased million or percent primarily due to an increase in kilowatt hour sales to og e customers system sales from warmer weather  the gep rider  higher margin sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales and customer growth 
kilowatt hour sales by og e to other utilities decreased percent in  however  the summer heat drove prices of this off system electricity to record levels  increasing operating revenues approximately million in and at margins significantly higher than had been experienced in the past 
there can be no assurance that such margins on future off system sales will occur again 
enogex revenues increased million or percent during  primarily as a result of significant increases in the volumes of natural gas sold through its gas marketing activities million  gas transportation services million and marketing of electricity million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in natural gas liquids processed and sold million 
the increased gas related revenues were attributable primarily to significantly higher volumes sold which more than offset a decrease in sales prices as such commodity prices were depressed 
other factors contributing to these increases were the acquisitions in of the noark pipeline and ozark pipeline  which are described below 
the increased electricity related revenues were due to the expansion in into the marketing of electricity 
on february   the occ issued an order the order that  among other things  effectively lowered og e s rates to its oklahoma retail customers by million annually based on a test year ended december  
of the million rate reduction  approximately million became effective on march   and the remaining million became effective march  this million rate reduction was in addition to the million rate reduction that was effective january  the order also directed og e to transition to competitive bidding of its gas transportation requirements  currently met by enogex  no later than april   and set annual compensation for the transportation services provided by enogex to og e at million until competitively bid gas transportation begins 
the order also established the gep rider  which is designed so that when og e s average annual cost of fuel per kwh is less than percent of the average non nuclear fuel cost per kwh of certain other investor owned utilities in the region  og e is allowed to collect  through the gep rider  one third of the amount by which og e s average annual cost of fuel is less than percent of the average of the other specified utilities 
if og e s fuel cost exceeds percent of the stated average  og e will not be allowed to recover one third of the fuel costs above that amount from oklahoma customers 
the fuel cost information used to calculate the gep rider is based on fuel cost data submitted by each of the utilities in their form no 
annual report filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the gep rider is revised effective july of each year to reflect any changes in the relative annual cost of fuel reported for the preceding calendar year 
for  the gep rider increased revenues compared to by approximately million  or approximately per share 
the current gep rider is estimated to positively impact revenue by million or approximately per share during the months ending june during  operating revenues increased million or percent primarily due to a significant increase in revenue from enogex 
in  enogex revenues increased million or percent  primarily as a result of significant increases in the volume of natural gas sold through its gas marketing activities million  and of natural gas liquids processed and sold million  mainly due to the acquisition of the nustar joint venture in may  with a modest increase in prices for natural gas 
the increased revenues from enogex were partially offset by decreased revenues at og e 
decreased revenues at og e were primarily attributable to the rate reduction in march  and milder weather in the first and second quarters of  partially offset by continued customer growth  the effect of the gep rider and warmer weather in the third quarter of expenses and other items percent change from prior year dollars in thousands fuel    purchased power    gas and electricity purchased for resale enogex    other operation and maintenance    depreciation and amortization    taxes    total operating expenses    total operating expenses increased million or percent in  primarily due to increases at og e in quantities of fuel burned and increased taxes 
at enogex  the increase was primarily due to increases in quantities of gas and electricity purchased for resale by its gas and electric marketing businesses 
enogex s gas and electricity purchased for resale pursuant to its energy marketing operations increased million or percent for compared to million or percent for the increase was due to a significant increase in sales volumes of natural gas  bbtu or percent which more than offset a decrease in sales prices due to depressed commodity prices 
this increase was also due to the recent expansion into the marketing of electricity 
the increase was due to a significant increase in sales volumes  bbtu or percent and an increase in purchase prices of approximately percent 
og e s generating capability is fairly evenly divided between coal and natural gas and provides for flexibility to use either fuel to the best economic advantage for og e and its customers 
in  fuel costs increased due to a modest increase in total generation and a slight increase in the average cost of fuel burned for generation of electricity 
during  despite a slight increase in kwh sales  fuel costs decreased million or percent primarily due to an increase in the percentage of coal fired generation relative to total generation 
other operation and maintenance decreased million or percent in primarily because of decreases at og e in post retirement medical costs million  bad debt expense million  completion in february of the amortization of the million regulatory asset established in connection with og e s workforce reduction million and general corporate expenses million 
these decreases were partially offset by expansion activities at enogex million 
in  other operation and maintenance expenses increased million primarily because of increased costs associated with expansion activities at enogex 
in  taxes increased million or percent primarily due to significantly higher pre tax income and normally occurring temporary differences 
in  taxes had a net decrease of million or percent primarily due to slightly lower pre tax income and normally occurring temporary differences 
purchased power costs increased million or percent in primarily due to a percent increase in the quantities purchased 
during  og e also began purchasing power from mid continent power company mcpc 
payments to mcpc in were approximately million 
mcpc is a qualified cogeneration facility from which og e is required to purchase peaking capacity through in  purchased power costs were million  remaining relatively constant compared to the million in as required by the public utility regulatory policy act purpa  og e is currently purchasing power from qualified cogeneration facilities 
variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to that component in cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s electric customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays enogex  which og e seeks to recover through the fuel adjustment clause or other tariffs 
in addition to the february   occ order  the apsc issued an order in july requiring  among other things  a million refund 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the july order 
og e has initiated numerous ongoing programs that have helped reduce the cost of generating electricity over the last several years 
these programs include utilizing a natural gas storage facility  spot market purchases of coal  renegotiated contracts for coal  gas  railcar maintenance and coal transportation  and a heat rate awareness program to produce kilowatt hours with less fuel 
reducing fuel costs helps og e remain competitive  which in turn helps og e s electric customers remain competitive in a global economy 
the increases in depreciation and amortization for and reflect higher levels of depreciable plant 
the increase in interest expense for was attributable to an increase in the average daily balance of short term debt 
interest on long term debt decreased as a result of og e refinancing million of long term debt at favorable rates 
the resulting savings was partially offset by enogex issuing million of long term debt 
in  the decrease in interest expense was attributable to og e retiring million of percent first mortgage bonds in january  the successful refinancing of million of short term and long term debt by og e and enogex in  and a lower average daily balance in short term debt 
liquidity and capital resources the primary capital requirements for and as estimated for through are as follows dollars in millions electric utility construction expenditures including afudc non utility construction expenditures and acquisitions maturities of long term debt total the company s primary needs for capital are related to construction of new facilities to meet anticipated demand for utility service  to replace or expand existing facilities in both its electric and non utility businesses  to expand its non utility businesses and to some extent  for satisfying maturing debt and sinking fund obligations 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings and permanent financing 
capital requirements and financing activities capital requirements were million in approximately million of the capital requirements were to comply with environmental regulations 
this compares to capital requirements of million in  of which million was to comply with environmental regulations 
during  the company s sources of capital were internally generated funds from operating cash flows  permanent financing and short term borrowings 
operating cash flow remained strong in as internally generated funds  short term debt and long term debt issued by noark pipeline systems  lp noark  met virtually all of the company s capital expenditures 
variations in accounts receivable and accounts payable are not generally significant indicators of the company s liquidity  as such variations are primarily attributable to fluctuations in weather in og e s service territory  which has a direct effect on sales of electricity 
short term borrowings were used during to meet temporary cash requirements 
at december   the company had outstanding short term borrowings of million 
on january   og e retired million principal amount of percent first mortgage bonds due january  on april   og e issued million in senior notes at percent due april  the proceeds from the sale of this new debt were applied to the redemption on april  of million principal amount of og e s percent first mortgage bonds due january   million principal amount of og e s percent first mortgage bonds due january  and million principal amount of og e s percent first mortgage bonds due november  and for general corporate purposes 
in october  the company made a million capital contribution to enogex reflecting the company s commitment to maintaining enogex s strong credit rating and financial health 
in january  enogex  through a newly formed subsidiary  enogex arkansas pipeline corp 
eapc acquired a percent interest in the partnership that owns noark  a natural gas pipeline  for approximately million and agreed to acquire ozark pipeline ozark  for approximately million 
the noark line is a mile intra state pipeline system that extends from near fort chaffee  arkansas to near paragould  arkansas 
the ozark line is a mile inter state pipeline system that begins near mcalester  oklahoma and terminates near searcy  arkansas 
in july  eapc completed its acquisition of ozark and contributed ozark to noark 
the two pipelines were integrated into a single  interstate transmission system on november  at an additional cost of approximately million 
current throughput capacity on the noark ozark line is approximately million cubic feet per day 
eapc  which funded the integration  owns a percent interest in noark and southwestern energy pipeline company owns the remaining percent interest in the partnership 
in january  eapc issued a million note at percent  due july  the proceeds from the note were utilized by eapc in the noark acquisition 
annual payments of approximately million including principal and accrued interest begin july  in june  noark pipeline finance  llc  a finance company subsidiary of noark  issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured percent notes due these notes are entitled to the benefits of a guaranty issued by enogex pursuant to which enogex has guaranteed percent subject to certain adjustments of the principal  interest and premium on such notes 
the remaining percent of the principal  interest and premium on such notes are guaranteed by southwestern energy company  the parent company of southwestern energy pipeline company 
the proceeds from the sale of the notes were loaned by noark pipeline finance  llc to noark and utilized by noark i to repay a bank revolving line of credit approximately million  ii to repay an outstanding short term loan from enogex approximately million and iii for general corporate purposes 
principal payments of million plus accrued interest are due semi annually 
in july  enogex agreed to lease underground gas storage from central oklahoma oil and gas corp 
coog 
coog currently leases gas storage capacity to og e 
in connection with this lease transaction  the company agreed to make up to a million secured loan to an affiliate of coog 
as part of this agreement  the company has an million loan outstanding repayable in and secured by the assets and stock of coog 
this loan is classified as other property and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
future capital requirements the company s construction program for the next several years does not include additional base load generating units 
rather  to meet the increased electricity needs of og e s electric utility customers during the foreseeable future  og e will concentrate on maintaining the reliability  increasing the utilization of existing capacity and increasing demand side management efforts 
approximately million of the company s construction expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
in november  the company announced plans to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock over the next two years 
on january   the company repurchased million shares of its common stock under an advanced share repurchase agreement with cibc oppenheimer corp 
the purchase price was million or per share  the closing price on january  under the terms of this advanced share repurchase agreement  the company will bear the risk of increases and the benefit of decreases on the price of the common stock until cibc oppenheimer corp 
replaces  through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions  the shares sold to the company 
future financing requirements may be dependent  to varying degrees  upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  acquisitions of other businesses  inflation  changes in environmental laws or regulations  rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies  new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators 
future sources of financing management expects that internally generated funds will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated construction expenditures  while maturities of long term debt will require permanent financing  with the amount and type dependent on market conditions at the time 
short term borrowings will continue to be used to meet temporary cash requirements 
the company has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
at december   the company had in place a line of credit for up to million  which was to expire december  in january  the company s line of credit was increased to million and the company entered into a million credit agreement with cibc oppenheimer corp 
to fund the share repurchase described above 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareowner returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions of non utility businesses 
permanent financing could be required for such acquisitions 
the year issue there has been a great deal of publicity about the year yk and the possible problems that information technology systems may suffer as a result 
the yk problem originated with the early development of computerized business applications 
to save then expensive storage space  reduce the complexity of calculations and yield better system performance  programmers and developers used a two digit date scheme to represent the year ie  for 
this two digit date scheme was used well into the s and s in traditional computer hardware such as mainframe systems  desktop personal computers and network servers  in customized software systems  off the shelf applications and operating systems  as well as in embedded systems chips in everything from elevators to industrial plants to consumer products 
as the year approaches  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems  including those of the company  its customers  suppliers  business partners and neighboring utilities to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly  if they are not year ready 
a failure to identify and correct any such processing problems prior to january  could result in material operational and financial risks if the affected systems either cease to function or produce erroneous data 
such risks are described in more detail below  but could include an inability to operate og e s generating plants  disruptions in the operation of its transmission and distribution system and an inability to access interconnections with the systems of neighboring utilities 
after the company s mainframe conversion in  some programs were identified as having date sensitive code 
all of these programs have since been corrected or will be replaced by yk ready packaged applications 
the company continues to address the yk issues in an aggressive manner 
this is reflected by the january  implementation throughout the company of sap enterprise software  which is yk ready  for the financial systems 
the sap installation significantly reduced the potential risks in our older computer systems 
the company is making significant progress towards the implementation of the enterprise wide software system for customer systems 
in addition to significantly reducing the potential risks of its current customer systems  the company is set to streamline work processes in customer service and power delivery by integrating separate systems into a single system using the enterprise wide software system 
this new single system will also provide for a more flexible automated billing system and enhancements in handling customer service orders  energy outage incidents and customer services 
in october of  the company formed a multi functional yk project team of experienced and knowledgeable members from each business unit to review and test its operational systems in an effort to further eliminate any potential problems  should they exist 
the team provides regular monthly reports on its progress to the yk executive steering committee and senior management as well as helping prepare presentations to the board of directors 
the company s year effort generally follows a three phase process phase i inventory and assess yk issues phase ii determine yk readiness of vendors  suppliers customers phase iii correct  test  implement solutions and contingency planning state of readiness the company has substantially completed the internal inventory and assessment phase i of the year plan 
follow up vendor surveys are being sent to vendors that have not responded to our original requests for information phase ii 
remediation efforts are ongoing and even though contingency planning is a normal part of our business  plans are being prepared to include specific activities with regard to yk issues phase iii 
in addition  as a part of the company s three year lease agreement for personal computers  all new personal computers are being issued with operating systems and application software that is yk ready 
all existing personal computers will be upgraded with yk ready operating systems before the turn of the century 
for embedded and plant operational systems  the company has generally completed the evaluative process and is commencing corrective plans 
in particular  the company s energy management system ems that monitors transmission interconnections and automatically signals generation output changes  has been contracted for replacement in equipment is currently being installed and software is being configured 
the company is also participating in an electric system readiness assessment program  which provides monthly reports to the southwest power pool spp and the north american electric reliability council nerc 
the responses from all participating companies are being compiled for an industry wide status report to the department of energy doe 
in addition  the company is in the process of developing its contingency plans that will be submitted shortly to the spp and nerc to assist them in assessing yk readiness of the regional electric grid 
costs of year issues as described above  with the mainframe conversion  the enterprise software installations and the ems replacement  a number of yk issues were addressed as part of the company s normal course upgrades to the information technology systems 
these upgrades were already contemplated and provided additional benefits or efficiencies beyond the year aspect 
in addition to the million spent to date for yk issues  since the company has spent in excess of million on the mainframe conversion  the enterprise software installations and the ems replacement 
the company expects to spend slightly less than million in these costs represent estimates  however  and there can be no assurance that actual costs associated with the company s yk issues will not be higher 
risks of year issues as described above  the company has made significant progress in the implementation of its year plan 
based upon the information currently known regarding its internal operations and assuming successful and timely completion of its remediation plan  the company does not anticipate significant business disruptions from its internal systems due to the yk issue 
however  the company may possibly experience limited interruptions to some aspects of its activities  whether information technology  operational  administrative or otherwise  and the company is considering such potential occurrences in planning for its most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
additionally  risk exists regarding the non readiness of third parties with key business or operational importance to the company 
year problems affecting key customers  interconnected utilities  fuel suppliers and transporters  telecommunications providers or financial institutions could result in lost power or gas sales  reductions in power production or transmission or internal functional and administrative difficulties on the part of the company 
although the company is not presently aware of any such situations  occurrences of this type  if severe  could have material adverse impacts upon the business  operating results or financial condition of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and correct all aspects of the year problem that affect it in sufficient time  that it will develop adequate contingency plans or that the costs of achieving yk readiness will not be material 
contingencies the company through its subsidiaries is defending various claims and legal actions  including environmental actions  which are common to its operations 
for a further discussion of these actions  including a lawsuit involving trigen oklahoma city energy corporation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as to environmental matters  og e has been designated as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to two waste disposal sites to which og e sent materials 
remediation of one of these sites has been completed and the required monitoring is in place 
og e s total waste disposed at the remaining site is minimal and on february   the company elected to participate in the de minimis settlement offered by the environmental protection agency epa  which is being contested by one party 
this limits the company s financial obligation in addition to removing any participation in the site remedy 
while it is not possible to determine the precise outcome of these matters  in the opinion of management  og e s ultimate liability for these sites will not be material 
beginning in  og e will be limited in the amount of sulfur dioxide it will be allowed to emit into the atmosphere 
in order to meet this limit the company has contracted for lower sulfur coal 
og e believes this will allow it to meet this limit without additional capital expenditures 
with respect to nitrogen oxides  og e continues to meet the current emission standard 
however  pending regulations on regional haze  and oklahoma s potential for not being able to meet the new ozone and particulate standards  could require further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides 
if this happens  significant capital expenditures and increased operating and maintenance costs would occur 
in  the united states was a signatory to the kyoto protocol on global warming 
if ratified by the us senate  this protocol could have a tremendous impact on the company s operations  by requiring the company to significantly reduce the use of coal as a fuel source  since the protocol would require a seven percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below the level 
the oklahoma department of environmental quality s caaa title v permitting program was approved by the epa in march by march of  og e had submitted all required permit applications and by january  og e expects to have new title v permits for all of its major source generating stations 
air permit fees for generating stations were approximately million in and are estimated to be approximately million in regulation  competition as previously reported  oklahoma enacted in april the electric restructuring act of the act 
in june  various amendments to the act were enacted 
if implemented as proposed  the act will significantly affect og e s future operations 
the purpose of the act  as set forth therein  is generally to restructure the electric utility industry to provide for more competition and  in particular  to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric utility industry in the state of oklahoma in order to allow customers to choose their electricity suppliers while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system in the state 
the act directs the joint electric utility task force  composed of seven members from the oklahoma senate and seven members from the oklahoma house of representatives  to undertake a study of all relevant issues relating to restructuring the electric utility industry in oklahoma and to develop a proposed electric utility framework for oklahoma 
the study was to be delivered in several parts 
as a result of the amendments  the time frame for the delivery of the remaining parts of the study was accelerated to october  this study is to address i technical issues including reliability  safety  unbundling of generation  transmission and distribution services  transition issues and market power  ii financial issues including rates  charges  access fees  transition costs and stranded costs  iii consumer issues such as the obligation to serve  service territories  consumer choices  competition and consumer safeguards  and iv tax issues including sales and use taxes  ad valorem taxes and franchise fees 
neither the oklahoma tax commission nor the occ is authorized to issue any rules on such matters without the approval of the oklahoma legislature 
other provisions of the act i authorize the joint electric utility task force to retain consultants to study  among other things  the creation of an independent system operator  ii prohibit customer switching prior to july   except by mutual consent  iii prohibit municipalities that do not become subject to the act  from selling power outside their municipal limits  except from lines owned on april   iv require a uniform tax policy be established by july  and v require out of state suppliers of electricity and their affiliates who make retail sales of electricity in oklahoma through the use of transmission and distribution facilities of in state suppliers to provide equal access to their transmission and distribution facilities outside of oklahoma 
a new bill was introduced in the state senate in january and if enacted would clarify certain ambiguities by defining key terms in the act 
in december  the apsc established four generic proceedings to consider the implementation of a competitive retail electric market in the state of arkansas 
during  the apsc held hearings to consider competitive retail generation  market structure  market power  taxation  recovery and mitigation of stranded costs  service and reliability  low income assistance  independent system operators and transition issues 
the company participated actively in those proceedings  and in october  the apsc issued its report on these issues to the arkansas general assembly 
on february   the occ issued an order  among other things  directing og e to transition to competitive bidding for its gas transportation requirements  currently met by enogex  no later than april  this order also set annual compensation for the transportation services provided by enogex to og e at million until competitively bid gas transportation begins 
in  approximately million or percent of enogex s revenues were attributable to transporting gas for og e 
other pipelines seeking to compete with enogex for og e s business will likely have to pay a fee to enogex for transporting gas on enogex s system or incur capital expenditures to develop the necessary infrastructure to connect with og e s gas fired generating stations 
nevertheless  a potential outcome of the competitive bidding process is that the revenues of enogex derived from transporting gas for og e may be significantly less after april  the occ has adopted rules that are designed to make the gas utility business in oklahoma more competitive 
these rules do not impact the electric industry 
yet  if implemented  the rules are expected to offer increased opportunities to enogex s pipeline and related businesses 
in october  the national energy policy act of energy act was enacted 
among many other provisions  the energy act is designed to promote competition in the development of wholesale power generation in the electric utility industry 
it exempts a new class of independent power producers from regulation under the public utility holding company act of and allows the ferc to order wholesale wheeling by public utilities to provide utility and non utility generators access to public utility transmission facilities 
in april  the ferc issued two final rules  orders and  which are having a significant impact on wholesale markets 
order  sets forth rules on non discriminatory open access transmission service to promote wholesale competition 
order  which was effective on july   requires utilities and other transmission users to abide by comparable terms  conditions and pricing in transmitting power 
order  which had its effective date extended to january   requires public utilities to implement standards of conduct and an open access same time information system oasis  formerly known as real time information networks 
these rules require transmission personnel to provide the same information about the transmission system to all transmission customers using the oasis 
in  the ferc issued clarifying final orders in response to rehearing requests by numerous market participants regarding orders no 
and during  og e submitted filings to the ferc to comply with these orders  and those filings have been accepted 
as og e continues to prepare for restructuring at the retail level  it is expected that additional filings will be made in order to ensure continuing compliance with the ferc s wholesale restructuring orders 
another impact of complying with ferc s order is a requirement for utilities to offer a transmission tariff that includes network transmission service nts to transmission customers 
nts allows transmission service customers to fully integrate load and resources on an instantaneous basis  in a manner similar to how og e has historically integrated its load and resources 
under nts  og e and participating customers share the total annual transmission cost for their combined joint use systems  net of related transmission revenues  based upon each company s share of the total system load 
management expects minimal annual expenses as a result of orders and as discussed previously  oklahoma enacted legislation that will restructure the electric utility industry in oklahoma by july  assuming that all the conditions in the legislation are met 
this legislation would deregulate og e s electric generation assets and the continued use of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation with respect to the related regulatory assets may no longer be appropriate 
this may result in either full recovery of generation related regulatory assets net of related regulatory liabilities or a non cash  pre tax write off as an extraordinary charge of up to million  depending on the transition mechanisms developed by the legislature for the recovery of all or a portion of these net regulatory assets 
the enacted oklahoma legislation does not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and the company believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory assets is appropriate 
however  if utility regulators in oklahoma and arkansas were to adopt regulatory methodologies in the future that are not based on cost of service  the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the regulatory assets related to the electric transmission and distribution assets may no longer be appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
on february   the apsc staff filed a motion for a show cause order to review og e s electric rates in the state of arkansas 
the staff is recommending a million annual rate reduction based on a test year ended december  
og e filed a cost of service study and has requested a million annual rate increase 
a decision on this rate case is expected in the next few months 
market risk risk management the risk management process established by the company is designed to measure both quantitative and qualitative risks in its businesses 
a senior risk management committee has been established to review these risks on a regular basis 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and certain commodity prices 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the company s policies on hedging practices 
derivative positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations and commercial paper 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the company does not currently participate in interest rate related derivative financial instruments 
the fair value of long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices and management s estimate of current rates available for similar issues 
the following table itemizes the company s long term debt maturities and the weighted average interest rates by maturity date 
year end dollars in millions thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate commodity price exposure the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in our commodity prices 
the prices of natural gas and electricity are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
to partially reduce price risk caused by these market fluctuations  the company s policy is to hedge through the utilization of derivatives a portion of the company s supply and related purchase and sale contracts  as well as any anticipated transactions purchases and sales 
because the commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company buys and sells in the physical market  no special studies other than monitoring the degree of correlation between the derivative and cash markets  are deemed necessary 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the price exposure to the market risk of the company s natural gas and electricity commodity positions 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of natural gas inventories  purchased electric capacity  commodity purchase and sales contracts  and derivative financial and commodity instruments 
the fair value of such position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in such prices over the next months 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows for fiscal dollars in thousands wholesale non trading commodity market risk  net besides the various existing contingencies herein described  and those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s ability to fund its future operational needs and to finance its construction program is dependent upon numerous other factors beyond its control  such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  inflation  new environmental laws or regulations  and the cost and availability of external financing
