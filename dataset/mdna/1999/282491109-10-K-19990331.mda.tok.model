item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests its available cash in short term us treasury obligations and commercial paper 
although the rate of interest paid on short term us treasury obligations and commercial paper may fluctuate over time based on changes in the general level of us interest rates  the company believes that its exposure to market risk fluctuation for these investments is not material due to the fact that all investments have a maturity of less than one year 
the company purchases its tobacco products from third party manufacturers  and therefore  does not believe that it has exposure to commodity price risk with respect to its tobacco inventories
