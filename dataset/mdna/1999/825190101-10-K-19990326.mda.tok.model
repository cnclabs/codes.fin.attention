item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides further information about the financial condition and results of operations of shoreline financial corporation 
it should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
highlights shoreline s net income for was million  up from last year s million while diluted earnings per share were compared with the earned last year 
the main reason for the increase was a increase in non interest income as net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  was up only and non interest expenses were higher for compared with the return on average assets was for and for the return on average equity ratio was and  respectively 
total assets were million at december   an increase of from the million reported at december  the increase was the result of the purchase of the state bank of coloma on july  and general growth within earning assets 
growth in the loan and investment securities portfolios of million and million  respectively  accounted for the increase in earning assets 
asset quality strengthened during with non performing assets decreasing to million  or 
of loans from million  or 
of loans at year end in addition  the allowance for loan losses at year end was  up from s ratio of  and coverage of non performing assets by the allowance was compared with 
at december   shareholders equity was million  million higher than at year end mainly due to net earnings retention and the shares issued for the acquisition of the state bank of coloma 
on july   shoreline completed its acquisition of the state bank of coloma  a state chartered commercial bank with assets of million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase under generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  the bank s assets  liabilities and operations have been included since the date of acquisition

summary of operating results net interest income the largest component of shoreline s operating income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest and fees earned on earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowed funds 
a number of factors influence net interest income  such as changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  market interest rates  governmental monetary and fiscal policies  and customer preference 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million in  an increase of million  or over s net interest income of million 
net interest income fte for was million 
shoreline s annual increases in net interest income resulted primarily from growth in the volume of earning assets 
average earning assets increased and for over and over  respectively  mainly from acquisitions completed during and table ii details the impact that the changes in volume and rate had on net interest income 
changes due to both volume and rate were allocated to volume and rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each

see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding recognition of loan fee income 
included in interest on loans are fees in the amount of   and  for  and  respectively 
yields are computed on a fully tax equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of percent for all years presented net interest margin the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
management continually monitors shoreline s balance sheet and employs other methods of analysis to protect net interest income from fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility 
these methods have produced net interest margins of  and for  and  respectively 
the net interest margin for was lower than s margin as the lower interest rate environment of caused both the yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities to decline 
for compared with  the net interest margin was negatively impacted by the acquisition of sjs bancorp 
sjs  like many thrift institutions  had a net interest margin substantially below that of the commercial banking industry due to its mix of earning assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount added to the allowance for loan losses to absorb losses that are currently anticipated 
the loan loss provision is based on historical loss experience and such other factors  which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in maintaining an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  for  and continued overall strength in asset quality measures along with another year of relatively modest levels of net charge offs helped to support the consistent level of provision for loan losses 
at year end  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was strong at compared with year end s ratio of 
the same ratio for year end was 
additional information on the provision for loan losses  net charge offs and non performing assets is provided in tables ix and xii presented later in this discussion other income non interest income for was higher than last year as gains realized on the sale of mortgages were significantly higher than in  and fees for trust  investments and deposit services continued to grow 
for compared with  non interest income increased 
the components of other income are shown in table iv 
table iv years ended december in thousands service charges on deposit accounts    trust income    net gain on security sales net gain loss on loan sales  other   total other income    service charges on deposit accounts  which increased from  remained the largest component of non interest income in trust income increased from a year ago as trust assets under management increased to million from million 
gains on the sale of mortgages increased million over s reported gains of 
million as a favorable interest rate environment kept new originations as well as refinancings high 
during  million of mortgage loans were originated with million being sold servicing released and million servicing retained 
the remaining loans originated were retained by shoreline for its mortgage portfolio 
other income increased primarily from gains on the sale of other assets  business manager income  atm fees  investment services income and insurance agency income 
the business manager program  an accounts receivable management program was introduced in this product helps cement relationships with customers while they improve their cash flows and avoids billing hassles 
the increase in other income for over was due primarily to gains on the sale of loans  an increase in trust income and a increase in service charge income 
other income also increased year over year due to a higher level of mortgage loan servicing fees 
other expense non interest expense was up million  or compared with of this increase  approximately 
million was directly attributable to the ongoing operating costs added as a result of the acquisitions made in mid and excluding these costs from both and  non interest expense would have increased 
table v years ended december in thousands salaries    employee benefits    occupancy    equipment    insurance professional fees    other taxes goodwill amortization other    total other expense    key ratios efficiency ratio other expense as a percent of average assets salary and employee benefits as a percent of average assets personnel costs  the largest category of non interest expense was up including the staffing costs added from acquisitions excluding these costs 
the primary reasons for the increase was normal compensation and fringe benefit cost adjustments  additional staff necessitated by new and expanded business opportunities and  as mentioned  acquisitions 
two ratios that measure internal efficiencies are the number of full time equivalent employees per one million dollars of average assets and net income per fte employee 
for  there were 
fte employees per one million dollars of average assets compared with 
a year ago and  of net income per fte employee versus  a year ago 
these ratios were 
and  for the remaining categories within non interest expense were up basically due to acquisitions and the investments made in technology during to better serve an expanding customer base and to resolve year issues 
the efficiency ratio measures non interest expense as a percent of the sum of net interest income fully taxable equivalent and non interest income 
the lower the ratio  the more efficiently a company s resources produce revenue 
table v includes the efficiency ratio over the past three years 
in  the efficiency ratio was compared with in this basis point improvement was mainly the result of steady growth in non interest income 
the burden ratio measures the relationship of non interest expense  net of non interest income  to average assets 
the burden ratio improved basis points since income tax expense income tax expense was million for compared with million in and million in a summary of significant tax components is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document

credit risk loan portfolio shoreline s management understands that credit risk is a fundamental element of its business 
conservative lending philosophies supported by comprehensive policies and administrative functions help shoreline lenders adhere to strict credit underwriting standards 
shoreline concentrates its lending efforts primarily in the communities in which shoreline bank branches are located and maintains a diversified loan portfolio of commercial  real estate and consumer loans 
shoreline bank has no foreign loans 
exposures to any single borrower  as well as industry concentrations  are continually monitored by management

the maturity and rate sensitivity for commercial and other selected loan categories is presented in table vii 
at december   residential mortgage loans totaled million compared with million at year end the decrease was the result of management s decision to sell more mortgages in the secondary market 
this decision was influenced in part by the borrower s preference for long term fixed rate loans 
consumer loans  which make up of the total portfolio  increased million between december  and december  included in consumer loans are direct and indirect auto loans  home equity loans and other secured and unsecured personal loans

allowance for loan losses management considers such factors as historical charge off experience  problem loan levels  current and projected economic conditions  portfolio mix and specific loan reviews in determining its allowance for loan losses 
quarterly  management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses with a detailed written analysis

funding is achieved through growth in deposits and accessibility to the money and capital markets 
deposits shoreline s primary source of funding is its deposits 
the average deposit balances outstanding and the rates paid on those deposits for the three years ended december  are presented as part of table ii  appearing earlier in this document 
the time remaining until maturity of time certificates of deposit of  or more at december  is as follows table xiii time until maturity in thousands three months or less  over three through six months  over six through twelve months  over twelve months  total  in addition to deposits  shoreline s sources of funding include both short and long term debt 
additional information regarding shoreline s debt is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document 
asset liability management asset liability management involves developing  implementing and monitoring strategies to maintain sufficient liquidity  maximize net interest income and minimize the impact significant fluctuations in market interest rates have on earnings 
shoreline s asset liability committee is responsible for managing this process 
much of this committee s efforts are focused on minimizing shoreline s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
one method of gauging sensitivity is a static gap analysis 
shoreline s static gap position at december  is shown in table xiv 
table xiv repriceable or maturing within to over in thousands days days years years total interest earning assets loans      securities      federal funds sold   interest earning deposits   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities time deposits     demand and savings accounts   other     total interest bearing liabilities      asset liability gap      cumulative asset liability gap     at december   shoreline had a cumulative liability gap position of million within the one year time frame 
this position suggests that if market interest rates decline in the next months  shoreline has the potential to earn more net interest income 
a limitation of the traditional static gap analysis  however  is that it does not consider the timing or magnitude of noncontractual repricing 
in addition  the static gap analysis treats demand and savings accounts as repriceable within days  while experience suggests that these categories of deposits are actually comparatively resistant to rate sensitivity 
because of these and other limitations of the static gap analysis  shoreline s asset liability committee utilizes simulation modeling as its primary tool to project how changes in interest rates will impact net interest income 
these models indicate  and management believes  shoreline is properly positioned against significant changes in rates without severely altering operating results 
however  management recognizes that  at the present time  shoreline s net interest margin may decline slightly under either a modest increase or decrease in interest rates from the current levels 
as discussed elsewhere  shoreline s net interest margin was negatively impacted by the decline in interest rates experienced during interest rate risk shoreline s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of shoreline s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
shoreline has only limited agricultural loan assets and  therefore  has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rate and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk irr is the exposure of a banking organization s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
accepting the risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value  however  excessive levels of irr could pose a significant threat to shoreline s earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains irr at prudent levels is essential to shoreline s safety and soundness 
evaluating a financial institution s exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to control irr and the organization s quantitative level of exposure 
when assessing the irr management process  shoreline seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems and internal controls are in place to maintain irr at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
evaluating the quantitative level of irr exposure requires shoreline to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity  and  where appropriate  asset quality 
various techniques may be used by an institution to measure and manage irr 
recognizing the limitations of static gap analysis  shoreline utilizes simulation analysis as the primary method of measuring its interest rate risk 
these simulation techniques involve changes in interest rate relationships and levels on all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  prepayment assumptions inherent in financial instruments  as well as changes in interest rate levels in order to quantify risk potential 
table xv illustrates the projected change in shoreline s net interest income during the next twelve months if all market rates were to uniformly and gradually increase or decrease by as much as over the same time period compared to results under a flat rate environment 
these projections  based on shoreline s balance sheet as of december   were prepared using the simulation analysis model and assumptions that shoreline was using for asset liability management purposes 
as of this date  shoreline had no derivative financial instruments  or trading portfolio 
the table indicates that if rates were to gradually and uniformly increase or decrease by  net interest income would be expected to remain essentially flat under a rising rate scenario and increase by under a declining rate scenario compared to results forecasted under a current rate environment 
this relatively modest projected exposure to interest rate risk is consistent with management s desire to limit the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates in order to reduce risk to earnings 
the model is based solely on gradual  uniform changes in market rates and does not reflect the levels of interest rate risk that may arise from other factors such as changes in the spreads between key market rates or in the shape of the treasury yield curve 
the expected maturity date values for loans receivable  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities were calculated by adjusting the instrument s contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments and call dates 
expected maturity date values for interest bearing core deposits were not based upon estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding  but rather the opportunity for repricing 
similarly  with respect to its variable rate instruments  shoreline believes that repricing dates  as opposed to expected maturity dates may be more relevant in analyzing the value of such instruments 
borrowings from the fhlb are reported based on repricing dates if variable rate in nature 
table xv projected effect on net interest income in thousands decrease in increase in december  existing flat rate rate rate change in interest rate from current existing level n a net interest income     change in net interest income from existing level n a n a decrease in increase in december  existing flat rate rate rate change in interest rate from current existing level n a net interest income     change in net interest income from existing level n a for comparison purposes  table xv also presents the comparable simulation analysis as of december  this comparison suggests that shoreline is somewhat more sensitive to a decrease in rates  but considerably less sensitive to an increase in rates  at december  than at december  shoreline is also subject to liquidity risk 
certain portions of an institution s liabilities may be short term or due on demand  while most of its assets may be invested in long term loans or investments 
accordingly  shoreline seeks to have in place sources of cash to meet short term demands 
these funds can be obtained by increasing deposits  borrowings  or selling assets 
also  federal home loan bank fhlb advances and short term borrowings provide additional sources of liquidity for shoreline 
capital resources at december   total equity capital of shoreline was million 
this includes an unrealized gain of million for shoreline s available for sale securities portfolio 
total equity capital was million at december  with an unrealized gain of million from available for sale securities 
during  shoreline issued  shares for the purchase of the state bank of coloma and retired  shares under its current repurchase program 
management monitors its capital levels to comply with regulatory requirements and to provide for current and future business opportunities 
as shown in table xvii  shoreline s capital ratios were well in excess of regulatory standards for classification as well capitalized 
being considered well capitalized is one condition for being assessed insurance premiums by the federal deposit insurance corporation at its lowest available rate 
table xvi regulatory well december minimum capitalized risk based tier i capital total capital tier i leverage cash dividends cash dividends paid increased to

per share  an increase of over table xviii summarizes the quarterly cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders during the last three years  adjusted for stock dividends and stock splits 
table xvii quarter st nd rd th total shoreline s principal source of funds to pay cash dividends is the earnings of its subsidiary bank 
state and federal laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that banks can pay 
cash dividends are dependent upon the earnings  capital needs  regulatory constraints and other factors affecting the bank 
based on projected earnings  management expects shoreline to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends on its common shares in impact of inflation reported earnings are affected by inflation  indirectly through changing interest rates  and directly by increased operating expenses 
however  in the opinion of management  the effects of general price level inflation have not had a material effect on the information presented in this report 
year readiness disclosure state of readiness shoreline does not develop or write its own software systems and programs 
it utilizes off the shelf systems developed by third party vendors 
in addition  it relies on third party vendors for various hardware and other services in executing daily operations 
a total inventory of all third party systems and services has been prepared 
using this inventory  shoreline has asked for and received responses from all third party software  hardware and service providers as to their year readiness and an assessment of those responses has been completed 
in the majority of cases  shoreline s vendors have indicated their systems or services to be year compliant 
shoreline has successfully completed its first phase of testing on its mainframe software system  and believes that the favorable response received from the third party provider was appropriate 
during the first quarter of  testing of other systems management considered critical to its state of readiness was completed satisfactorily 
costs shoreline has incurred expenses throughout related to this project and will continue to incur expenses over the next year 
based on available information  these expenses are not expected to have a materially adverse impact on operating results  financial condition  or liquidity 
existing staff that has been redeployed represents a significant portion of these expenses to this project 
through december   total expenses accrued for remediation and testing relating to the year issue were  estimates of incremental costs for remediation over the remaining period of this project is projected to be between  and  which will be recorded as expense when and as accrued 
risks shoreline believes its management has taken  and will continue to take  all prudent actions needed to address year issues 
in addition  it is acting to comply with directives provided by its regulators with respect to year and has received on site examinations from its regulators to determine its readiness 
while management anticipates successful implementation of its year readiness plan and believes its current estimates of cost reasonable  it can not guarantee actual results will not materially differ from those anticipated  and it can not assure that all third parties upon which shoreline relies will not have business interruptions due to year issues 
contingency plans shoreline currently has a disaster recovery plan for its information technology system 
additional contingency plans for other mission critical or high risk systems not covered in the current disaster recovery plan are expected to be completed by april  in addition to reviewing its own computer operating systems and applications  shoreline has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which shoreline s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to resolve their year issues 
there is no assurance that the systems of other companies on which shoreline s systems rely will be timely converted 
if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have an adverse impact on the operations of shoreline 
the costs of the project and the date on which shoreline believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause differences include  but are not limited to  the ability of other companies on which shoreline s systems rely to modify or convert their systems to be year compliant  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
this year readiness disclosure is based upon and partially repeats information provided by shoreline s outside consultants  vendors and others regarding the year readiness of shoreline and its customers  vendors and other parties 
although shoreline believes this information to be accurate  it has not in each case independently verified such information 
the year statements contained in this report and in other reports and materials filed with the securities and exchange commission by shoreline are year readiness disclosures under the year information and readiness disclosure act item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information presented under the subcaptions asset liability management and interest rate risk in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is incorporated herein by reference
