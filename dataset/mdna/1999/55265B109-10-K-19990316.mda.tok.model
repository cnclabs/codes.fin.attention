item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year compliance 
government regulation the health care industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation of physicians  other health care providers  managed care organizations and other third party payors 
health care regulation affects the company s operations both directly and indirectly 
many states require regulatory approval  including certificates of need  before establishing or expanding certain types of health care facilities or offering certain health care services 
several states in which the company operates prohibit the corporate practice of medicine except by professional medical corporations or associations 
the company provides only nonphysician services and does not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians to whom it provides its services 
in addition  the laws of many states prohibit physicians from splitting fees with non physicians  and some states have promulgated statutes that prohibit the solicitation  payment  receipt or offering of any direct or indirect remuneration for referral of patients and that prohibit referrals by physicians for designated health services to entities with which they have a financial relationship 
the company believes that its current and planned activities are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulation as currently interpreted 
there can be no assurance  however  that a review of the company s business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect the operations of the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the company operates will not change significantly in the future  which change could adversely affect the company s operations  financial condition  business opportunities or future expansion 
the manufacturers of medical devices utilized by the company are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
failure of the manufacturer of such devices to comply with fda regulations could result in the loss of approval by the fda of such medical devices 
in addition  physicians in the company s network are subject to significant federal and state regulation 
the ability of the company to operate profitably will depend in part upon its network physicians  the manufacturers of its medical devices and its third party payors obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses  certificates of need and other approvals  and operating in compliance with applicable health care regulations 
the company s services involve the handling of chemical and biological substances and regulated waste materials  some of which may be considered contaminated  hazardous or toxic 
the company is subject to state and federal laws that regulate labor and environmental matters such as the handling and disposal of regulated medical wastes  the release of pollutants and contaminants into the air and water  and the protection of employees who may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials including those which may contain bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis b virus 
the company is also subject to federal and state laws relating to business conduct and general employee matters 
the company believes that it is in material compliance with applicable laws 
competition the company competes with companies that offer medical equipment to physicians offices on either a rental or a fee for service basis and with hospitals and surgery centers that provide comparable surgical services 
the company also competes with other providers in the health care industry for access to technology  relationships with third party payors and relationships with physicians 
the company believes the trend toward managed care could increase the competition to obtain contracts with third party payors 
the health care industry is highly competitive and is subject to continuing changes in the manner in which such services are provided and the manner in which providers are selected and paid 
some of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
in addition  competitors of the company could obtain exclusive rights to provide mobile surgical services for products that the company currently offers or expects to offer 
the market for aesthetic elective services is highly competitive 
the company believes that the heightened interest in aesthetic procedures among physicians and patients  the development of advanced medical technologies to perform aesthetic procedures and the industry practice of requiring immediate cash payment for such services will create increased competition in this segment 
competition in the provision of medical surgical services may also increase because these services are becoming more accepted by physicians  patients and third party payors and the medical equipment used in providing such services is readily available from various sources 
the company believes that competition in the provision of services to create temporary office based surgical environments is based on the price  quality  breadth and availability of services 
the company considers its comprehensive high quality services  trained on site technical personnel  per case billing for certain services and strategic relationships with payors and medical device manufacturers to be important factors in enabling it to compete effectively 
the company believes that it is the only national provider of medical surgical services for use in performing office based procedures that has developed contracts with managed care organizations 
insurance the company maintains professional  general and product liability insurance in amounts deemed appropriate by management 
the company carries an aggregate of million of general and public liability insurance coverage  which covers premises  operations and product liability  and a million professional liability insurance policy

should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated  believed  estimated or expected 
the company does not intend to update these forward looking statements 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s existing or future services will gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians  patients and third party payors 
the company believes that market acceptance of office based procedures  including those performed using the company s services  depends upon various factors including i the company s ability to provide evidence to the medical community of the safety and efficacy of the office based procedures and the corresponding benefits to payors  physicians and patients  ii the willingness of physicians to perform and patients to undergo procedures in the physician s office which have traditionally been performed in a hospital or outpatient facility  iii the willingness of physicians to perform and patients to undergo procedures under local rather than under general anesthesia  iv the willingness of physicians to utilize the company s services rather than perform office based procedures utilizing their employees and medical equipment  and v the continued availability of third party reimbursement for certain procedures performed using the company s services 
acquisition  obsolescence and regulation of advanced technology 
the company s future success will depend in large part on the company s ability to provide advanced medical technology to physicians 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
the acquisition of medical technology requires substantial expenditures  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  acquiring and receiving timely delivery of technology for which sufficient demand will exist and that such technology will not become obsolete during its anticipated product life cycle 
currently  there are alternative technologies to those offered by the company 
such technologies may gain broader market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategy to obtain medical technology through relationships with medical equipment manufacturers and distributors will be successful or  if successful  that such relationships can be maintained 
in addition  the medical equipment utilized by the company requires approval by the food and drug administration the fda  and there can be no assurance that such medical equipment will receive or retain fda approval for desired current and future applications 
the loss of any fda approval for such equipment could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results or financial condition  as the company would be unable to utilize such equipment in the provision of its services 
furthermore  the medical equipment industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that manufacturers or distributors of medical equipment utilized by the company will obtain or retain patents or other intellectual property rights related to the equipment used by the company 
see regulation of and change in the health care industry and business business strategy establishing strategic alliances with medical equipment manufacturers 
uncertainty of acquisitions 
the company s strategy has included and will continue to include growth through acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully identify  complete or integrate any acquisition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any future acquisition will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s operating results or financial condition  particularly during the period in which the operations of the acquired business are being integrated into the company 
furthermore  the company s ability to make acquisitions may depend upon its ability to obtain financing  and there can be no assurance that financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
competition 
the market for aesthetic elective services is highly competitive due to i low barriers to entry  ii low capital requirements  and iii high profitability 
currently  the company believes its competition is primarily comprised of small  locally based equipment rental companies 
competition in the provision of medical surgical services may also increase because these services are becoming more accepted by physicians  patients and third party payors and because the medical equipment used in providing such services is readily available from various sources 
the company competes with companies that offer medical equipment to physicians offices on either a rental or a fee for services basis  and with hospitals and surgery centers that provide comparable surgical services 
the company also competes with other providers in the health care industry for access to technology  relationships with third party payors and relationships with physicians 
any of these competitors may have greater financial and other resources than the company 
the health care industry is highly competitive and is subject to continuing changes in the manner in which health care services are provided and the manner in which providers are selected and paid 
there can be no assurance that competition will not adversely affect the company s operating results or its ability to maintain or increase net revenues 
reimbursement risk 
the company generally receives payment directly from the patient or physician for its aesthetic elective services 
in those instances where payment is not received at the time of the service  the company will invoice the responsible party 
if the invoice is not paid  the account is subject to write off as an uncollectible account 
the company relies almost exclusively on third party payors for payment for its medical surgical services 
if the claim is invoiced to a noncontracted payor  ie  a noncontracted managed care plan or an indemnity plan  the claim is subject to denial by the payor 
denial of reimbursement may occur  among other reasons  because of the claim examiner s lack of understanding regarding the company s services or the lack of a contractual arrangement with a managed care company 
to the extent any third party payor ultimately fails to recognize or accept company s services as being reimbursable  the company may not be able to collect fees for its services 
in addition  the health care industry is experiencing a trend toward cost containment  and third party payors are seeking to reduce the cost and control the utilization of health care services and to negotiate reduced payment schedules with service providers 
reduced payment schedules could result in lower revenues for the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate satisfactory arrangements with managed care organizations or other third party payors under such conditions  or at all 
see business business strategy continuing the development of managed care contracts 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of its senior management and other key personnel 
because the company has a relatively small number of employees  its dependence on retaining its employees is particularly significant 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified management and professional personnel 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s current employees will continue to work for the company 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s key employees could adversely affect the company s operating results or financial condition 
further  the company s growth in revenue has resulted  to a significant degree  from the hiring and training of new field personnel 
the company s continued growth will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain high quality field and other personnel 
the company may need to grant additional stock options to key employees and to provide similar or other forms of incentive compensation to attract and retain key personnel 
fluctuations in quarterly results  volatility of stock price 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
as a result  the company s stock price may by subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
quarterly revenues and operating results will depend upon  among other factors i seasonal demand for the company s services  ii the timing of new service introductions by the company  iii the timing of regulatory and third party reimbursement approvals  iv the timing of acquisitions or entry into new markets  and v the timing of expenditures for medical equipment 
a shortfall in revenues from anticipated levels  changes in general conditions in the economy or the health care industry  or other developments affecting the company or its competitors  could cause the market of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
regulation of and change in health care industry 
the health care industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the company s services generally are not directly subject to health care rules or regulations  although such rules and regulations apply to the equipment provided to physicians by the company and to the medical personnel utilizing the company s services and products and therefore may indirectly affect the company s business 
in addition  promulgation of new laws and regulations  or changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  may directly or indirectly affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
further  the company s services involve the handling of chemical and biological substances  thereby subjecting the company to certain labor and environmental regulations 
see hazardous materials 
there can be no assurance that a review of the company s operations by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect the operations of the company 
the manufacturers of medical equipment utilized by the company are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
failure of such manufacturers to obtain fda approval for new technologies which the company wishes to offer may adversely affect the company s plans for future expansion 
in addition  failure of medical equipment manufacturers to comply with fda regulations could result in the loss of approval by the fda of medical equipment utilized by the company  which could adversely affect the company s operating results or financial condition 
subject to certain statutory exceptions  physicians who have a financial relationship with an entity providing health services are prohibited by federal law the stark ii legislation from referring or admitting patients to that entity for the furnishing of certain designated services reimbursable under medicare or medicaid  as well as certain other federally assisted state health care programs 
possible sanctions for violations for the stark ii legislation include civil monetary penalties  exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs  and forfeiture of all amounts collected in violation of such prohibition 
federal law generally prohibits certain activities under medicare and medicaid programs the fraud and abuse statutes 
violations of anti kickback legislation are felonies punishable by monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare or medicaid programs 
several states in which the company operates prohibit the corporate practice of medicine except by professional medical corporations or associations 
several states in which the company operates also prohibit physicians from splitting fees with non physicians 
although the company has attempted to structure its business relations with physician groups to comply with the stark ii legislation  the fraud and abuse statutes  and the state corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws  there can be no assurance that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with the company s practices or that other laws or regulations will not be enacted in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results or financial condition 
while the company does not currently derive any of its net revenues from medicare or medicaid programs  and therefore it is not subject to such federal legislation  there can be no assurance in the future that i future legislation may not be expanded to include health care services other than those subject to medicare or medicaid reimbursement  ii the company will not derive net revenues from medicare or medicaid reimbursements  or iii managed care providers with which the company has contracts will not contract with medicare or medicaid 
certain of the states in which the company currently operates or may operate in the future have laws which prohibit physicians who have financial relationships with an entity that provides health care services from referring patients to that entity and that prohibit arrangements which provide remuneration to physicians in order to induce the referral of business 
possible sanctions for violation of these laws include civil monetary penalties  forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws and the requirement that the company discontinue the prohibited activity 
although the company believes it has structured its existing business relations with physician groups to comply with these laws  there can be no assurance that such laws will be interpreted in a manner consistent with the company s practices 
such laws in states where the company may conduct operations in the future could prohibit the company from structuring its business relations with physician groups in the same manner in which it conducts its current operations 
accordingly  such prohibitions could adversely affect the future growth of the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the company operates will not change significantly in the future  which change could adversely affect the company s operations  financial condition  business opportunities or future expansion 
as consolidation among physician provider groups continues and provider networks continue to be created  purchasing decisions may shift to persons with whom the company has not had prior contact 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its physician  payor or manufacturer relationships under such circumstances
