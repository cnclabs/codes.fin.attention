debt on september   the company obtained a million aud approximately million us bank facility from westpac banking corporation in order to refinance the claims of the company s unsecured creditors 
the westpac loan provides for a five year term at an interest rate equal to the australian interbank borrowing rate  plus a margin 
the margin is based on a formula tied to the company s international operations ratio of debt to earnings before interest and taxes  and varies between and 
the westpac loan involved the collateralization of the company s principal operating assets of its international division 
the westpac loan is subject to a number of financial covenants and other restrictions 
based on current levels of operations and anticipated sales growth  management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet all of its debt service requirements when due and to fund its capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
inflation increases in interest rates and the costs of labor  food and construction can significantly affect the company s operations 
management believes that the current practices of maintaining adequate operating margins through a combination of menu price increases and cost controls  careful management of working capital and evaluation of property and equipment needs are its most effective tools for coping with inflation 
other the company is aware of industry concerns regarding the potential impact of possible further increases in the minimum wage  the increased marketing of prepared foods by grocery and convenience stores  customer resistance to increases in menu prices  the growth of home delivery of prepared foods  increased concerns over the nutritional value of foods and compliance with existing or proposed health and safety legislation and other similar contingencies 
the company is unable to predict the possible impact of such factors on its business 
in the past  the company has been able to address similar types of changes in the business climate and been able to pass any associated higher costs along to its customers  because the changes have generally impacted all restaurant companies 
year the company is aware of the broad impact the year issue could have on its business and  as a result  in fiscal established a comprehensive enterprise wide program to prepare its computer systems and applications 
this program consists of three areas information systems  supply chain and critical third party readiness and business equipment 
the company has utilized both internal and external resources to inventory  assess  remediate  replace and test its systems for year compliance and expects that all mission critical systems will be year compliant by october  the company s assessment of the impact of the year issue indicated that several information technology projects required acceleration due to potential year issues 
specifically the company has upgraded certain software applications and is in the process of replacing others in connection with a lease that ended in the ordinary course of business 
to reduce the risks associated with the year the company has closely assessed the vendors supplying the company s restaurants with food and other products to ensure that they are aware of the year business risks and are appropriately addressing them 
surveys were sent to critical suppliers and service providers to obtain reasonable assurance that plans are in place to address the year issue 
contingency plans have been developed for those vendors that have not provided the company with satisfactory evidence of their readiness to handle year issues 
the company is also communicating with its franchise business partners regarding the potential business risks associated with the year issue 
equipment critical to restaurant and corporate office operations was scheduled to be replaced in early fiscal in connection with a lease ending in the ordinary course of business 
the new equipment is year compliant and is currently being installed 
the cost incurred by the company to date for software and hardware is approximately  and management estimates the remaining cost to complete year upgrades to be approximately  these costs were budgeted and will be funded by cash flow from operations 
the company believes that based on available information the costs related to year compliance will not be material to its financial position 
however  the cost of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions including the availability of certain resources  third party modification programs and other factors 
unanticipated failures by critical vendors and franchise partners  as well as the failure by the company to execute its own remediation efforts could have a material adverse effect on the cost of the project and its completion date 
as a result there can be no assurance that these forward looking estimates will be achieved and the actual cost and vendor compliance could differ materially from those plans resulting in material financial risk 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures the company is protected against the risk of foreign exchange fluctuations associated with its bank facility with westpac banking corporation because both the borrowings and principal and interest payments are denominated in australian dollars and the company funds its principal and interest payments from cash generated by its restaurant operations in australia
