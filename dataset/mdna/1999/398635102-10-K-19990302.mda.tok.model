the sales of the stores amounted to  of the annualized week s sales 
in addition  the remodeling of stores during the week period resulted in substantial sales increases 
sales for the same stores were  for the weeks ended november  as compared with  for the weeks ended december   a decrease of 
the sales decline in the period was due to the same favorable weather conditions during such period and continuing deflationary pressures in food prices previously noted 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was for the week period ended november  as compared to for the week period ended march  the decreases in gross profit margin was mainly due to the curtailment of our long term forward buying program in the november period as compared to the march period

professional fees were of sales for the week period ended november  as compared with of sales for the week period ended march  the decrease was due to the reduced need for the services of outside legal counsel in connection with litigation  real estate and general corporate matters 
the subcategory corporate expenses are those expenses attributable only to a public company and are thus solely applicable to the week period ended november  liquidity and capital resources on november   the company completed its financial arrangements with a group of banks for a credit facility in the aggregate amount of  under the credit agreement the company obtained a term loan in the amount of  to refinance prior bank debt  an improvement term loan line of credit in the amount of  to finance capital improvements to its supermarkets and a revolving line of credit in the amount of  to provide working capital 
the  term loan matures on october  the improvement term loan line of credit and the revolving line of credit mature on october  and november   respectively  at which times all amounts outstanding thereunder are payable 
presently  the bank facilities are fully utilized and the company is negotiating an increase in the credit facilities with its banks 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate such an increase on terms satisfactory to the company 
if the company is unable to obtain its desired financing from its bank  the company will seek increased financing from third party leasing companies and or additional financing from the company s principal shareholder and other sources 
the company has not incurred any material commitments for capital expenditures  although it anticipates spending approximately  on its store remodeling and expansion program in fiscal such amount is subject to adjustment based on the availability of funds 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at a spread over either the prime rate of the bank acting as agent for the group of banks or a libor rate  with the spread dependent on the ratio of the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the facility during the weeks ended november  was per annum 
the credit facility contains covenants  representations and events of default typical of credit facility agreements  including financial covenants which require the company to meet  among other things  a minimum tangible net worth  debt service coverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios  and which limit transactions with affiliates 
the facility is secured by equipment  inventories and accounts receivable 
during fiscal the company and the banks amended the credit facility to  among other things  modify certain of the financial covenants and extend the term of the revolving line of credit by one month until november  the company has available approximately million in third party leasing lines of credit to lease finance equipment for its store remodeling and expansion program 
year issue the company has assesed its information technology it systems for the year readiness and has given the highest priority to those it systems it considers mission critical 
the systems the company considers mission critical are its store automation systems including point of sale systems and its computer systems at its main office which support these store systems 
management expects all in store it systems as well as the host support system located in the company s main office will be certified by the original vendor as year compliant by may  these systems were either year compliant as installed or are being upgraded by the original vendors to a year compliant status under the existing maintenance programs 
no additional expense has or will be incurred by the company to bring these systems in to year compliance since any necessary changes are provided by the vendors under software maintenance programs 
the company has assessed its other it systems  including accounting and payroll systems  deployed at its main office and its city produce warehouse facility for year compliance and has identified the steps necessary to ensure systems will be year compliant 
the company has developed and tested a methodology that will allow its existing software programs to be year compliant by making minor changes to some of the existing programs 
the existing data files need not be altered 
the company will perform application level review to identify processes that involve the input of output of a date 
that program will require a minor modification utilizing the already tested code  to make it year compliant 
these systems will then be tested to confirm that they function as expected 
some of the company s hardware is not now year compliant and the company has budgeted for the replacement or modification of such hardware as necessary in the first half of the company expects to spend  for hardware and will spend an additional  for software modifications and related expenses to ensure that these systems are compliant 
the company expects that the necessary funds for these expenditures will come from cash flow generated from its operations 
all testing on these systems in expected to be completed by june  at which time it is expected that these systems will be year compliant 
the company does not currently intend to hire an outside firm to independently verify that its systems are year compliant 
the company has assessed the majority of its non it systems for year readiness and has identified a small number of systems  including certain equipment at store level  which may not be year ready 
the company is working with the vendor of these systems of identify the best approach 
while these systems have an internal clock and date  the date is not necessary for the systems to be productive 
such systems could therefore continue to function as need and management does not anticipate that these systems will pose any significant year problem or expense 
the company has begun to review the year readiness plans of its major vendors in an effort to ensure that operations remain unaffected by year related failures 
the company will place preset orders with certain major vendors to help ensure product deliveries in the event that the vendor is affected by failures at some level of its operations but is still able to deliver merchandise 
in the event a major vendor is unable to provide products the company will increase its purchases from other vendors from which it currently buys 
the company purchases merchandise sold in its stores from multiple vendors and is not reliant on any one vendor for the normal conduct of its operations 
the company is not dependant on these supplier relationships since merchandise is readily available from numerous sources under different brand names  subject to conditions affecting food supplies generally 
the company believes that its efforts will result in year compliance 
however  the impact on business operations of failure by the company to achieve compliance of failure by external entities which the company cannot control  such as vendors  to achieve compliance  could be material to the company s consolidated results of operations
