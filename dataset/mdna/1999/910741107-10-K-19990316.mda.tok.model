item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
uirt has been operating since as a texas reit engaged in the acquisition  ownership  management  leasing and redevelopment of neighborhood and community shopping centers in the sunbelt region of the united states 
uirt focuses on purchasing properties anchored primarily by national and regional supermarkets  drug stores and other credit worthy retailers that offer everyday necessities and convenience to their neighborhood communities 
results of operations quarter ended december  net income was  or per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of  up from  or per share  for the same quarter of the increase in net income from to is due primarily to uirt s acquisitions since december  and a charge in of  for issuance of stock to the investment manager 
rental revenues were  for the fourth quarter of  as compared to  for the fourth quarter of this increase relates almost totally to acquisitions 
interest expense increased by  from  in to  in this increase was due mainly to the increase in the average debt outstanding between periods  from  for to  for the increase in debt outstanding is primarily a result of expenditures for acquisitions since december  the increases in depreciation and amortization  operating expenses  and property taxes were primarily the result of acquisitions 
twelve months ended december  net income was  or per share in  compared to net income in of  or per share 
net income for includes the effect of  in amortization of bridge financing costs and  of extraordinary charges  or an aggregate per weighted average share 
earnings in before such charges were  or per weighted average share 
net income for includes the effect of the above mentioned  charge 
the increase in earnings before non recurring and extraordinary charges is primarily a result of operating income generated by properties acquired since december  rental revenues increased to  in  compared with  for the same period of the prior year 
this increase relates almost totally to acquisitions since december  interest expense  before amortization of bridge financing costs  increased by  from  in to  in weighted average debt outstanding increased from  for to  for the increase in weighted average debt outstanding is primarily a result of expenditures for acquisitions  including the amounts borrowed and repaid under the bridge financing arrangement 
the increases in depreciation and amortization  operating expenses and property taxes were primarily the result of acquisitions since december  primarily in order to manage properties acquired in  the investment manager had approximately employees more on december  than on the same date in  since december  through march   the investment manager employed four additional personnel 
all of these employees are assigned full time to property operations accounting  leasing  and asset management and their salaries and related benefit costs are reimbursed by uirt to the investment manager 
uirt believes that the level of staffing at march  is generally sufficient to operate currently owned properties and additional properties that may be acquired during liquidity and capital resources uirt acquired four shopping centers for approximately  including approximately  in assumed debt and refinanced approximately  in mortgage debt in february with the proceeds of a  bridge financing arrangement 
in march and april  uirt sold  common shares through the ipo and raised approximately  net of offering costs 
the proceeds were used to repay the bridge financing  acquire partnership units from minority interest holders  retire preferred shares and convertible debt  and acquire five additional properties for approximately  including approximately  in assumed debt 
at december   cash and cash equivalents of approximately  were comprised of cash flow from operations 
cash flows provided by operations for the twelve months ended december  were  versus  for the year earlier period 
substantially all of the year to year difference is the result of operating income from properties acquired since december  and the effect of changes in the amounts of and interest rates on mortgage debt as a result of the refinancing described below and the assumption of debt in connection with the acquisitions 
the properties acquired since december  comprise approximately  square feet of gla  and were acquired subject to approximately  in mortgage debt 
in addition  one of the properties was acquired by a limited partnership in which uirt is the sole general and a majority limited partner  the limited partnership issued limited partnership units to the sellers of the property in consideration of the sellers contributing the property to the partnership 
such limited partnership units were valued at approximately  and are convertible to  common shares after may  in connection with our intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  uirt expects to continue paying regular distributions to shareholders 
these distributions will be paid from operating cash flows that are expected to increase due to property acquisitions and growth in rental revenues in the existing portfolio and from other sources 
since cash used to pay distributions reduces amounts available for capital investment  uirt generally intends to maintain a conservative distributions payout ratio  reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in our portfolio  debt reduction  and the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise 
it is our intention that uirt continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business 
accordingly  uirt may seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings or debt financing in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt capitalization policy 
we anticipate that adequate cash will be available from operations to fund its operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and the payment of distributions in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
uirt executed a revolving line of credit agreement during the third quarter of the line of credit  which was initially collateralized by four of our texas properties  provides for borrowings of up to  at approximately basis points over a london interbank offered rate 
at december   we had borrowed approximately  under the line of credit  and had issued letters of credit aggregating approximately  approximately  was available under the line of credit at december  pursuant to board approval  uirt repurchased  common shares during the third and fourth quarters of the prices paid were the market prices on the dates of purchase and averaged approximately per share 
twelve months ended december  for the year ended december   net income was  as compared to  in during  uirt awarded the investment manager and certain officers and trust managers an aggregate of  common shares  for which uirt took a charge of  also  uirt incurred  in additional professional costs related to the employment of a contract chief financial officer  and  in fees related to a canceled bridge financing 
without these charges  net income for the year ended december  would have been  as compared to  in  an decrease 
total revenues increased to  for as compared to  in of the increase   was attributable to the addition of two shopping centers in late interest expense increased from  in to  in  an increase of 
of this amount   is directly attributable to mortgages assumed in connection with the acquisition of the two shopping centers in late depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in from  in  most of this increase is attributable to the addition of the two shopping centers in late trust manager fees were  in each of and advisory fees increased from  in to  in advisory fees  which were based on a percentage of assets of uirt in and increased as a result of the acquisition of the two shopping centers in late effective january  the method of calculating the advisory fee was changed and is currently based on a percentage of funds from operations as defined in the advisory agreement 
had this change been in effect in and  the investment manager would have received  and  respectively 
the year issue many computer systems were designed and programmed in such a manner as to be unable to recognize dates beyond december  in such cases  computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year management has completed an evaluation of the risks of a material effect on uirt s results of operations and financial condition with respect to its management information systems and the year issue 
uirt uses application software  including its accounting and property management software  which has been certified by vendors as being year compliant 
accordingly  management does not believe that uirt s results of operations or financial condition have been or will be materially affected by any future costs to make its management information systems year compliant 
additionally  management does not expect to incur any material costs to correct year deficiencies in its management information systems 
in addition to management information systems  the year risks include those related to embedded technology  such as micro controllers  and to the year issues of other parties with which uirt has material relationships 
uirt has recently completed the process of assessing these risks 
with respect to embedded technology  the assessment process included surveying each of the properties to determine which systems may be subject to disruptions 
these systems may include climate control  lighting  security  and telecommunications 
management believes that substantially all such systems  if not year compliant  can be controlled by manual operation and monitoring for the remainder of their economic lives 
accordingly  management believes uirt will not be forced to replace or upgrade non compliant components if any of such systems and has no present plans for replacement or upgrade 
should such systems require manual operation and monitoring  uirt may experience an immaterial increase in labor costs for its property management operations until such time as the non compliant components are replaced in the ordinary course of business 
management is not presently aware of any year issues related to other parties that may adversely affect uirt 
based on the relatively small number of properties and a low level of reliance on technology for property operations  revenue collections  and cash disbursements  management believes that documentation of transactions that might otherwise be disrupted will be available to recreate transaction records if necessary 
funds from operations uirt considers funds from operations to be an alternate measure of the performance of an equity reit since such measure does not recognize depreciation and amortization of real estate assets as operating expenses 
management believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
nareit defines funds from operations as net income plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  less gains and losses on sales of properties 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of uirt s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations increased to  for the fourth quarter of  as compared to  for the same period of for the twelve months ended december   funds from operations totaled  up  from the same period of the prior year 
this increase relates almost totally to the impact of uirt s acquisitions since december united investors realty trust calculation of funds from operations and funds available for distribution three months ended twelve months ended dec dec dec dec funds from operations net income     plus depreciation expense     plus share grant to advisor and officers   plus write off of costs associated with unsuccessful acquisition  plus loss on early extinguishment of debt  plus write off of unamortized bridge financing costs  plus minority interest town n country   funds from operations     funds from operations per share and downreit unit funds available for distribution funds from operations     plus amortization of financing costs and leasing costs     less tenant improvements     less leasing commissions     less capital improvements     less straight line rents     amounts received from seller pursuant to master lease   funds available for distribution     funds available for distribution per share and downreit unit basic and diluted weighted average number of shares and downreit partnership units     item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations 
we do not have any significant foreign operations and thus are not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations
