item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and outlook the company s results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of oil and gas exploration and development activity maintained by oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  north africa  west africa  latin america  and the middle east  ii the company s ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements and iii the company s ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and gas prices  and changes in technology which reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment 
over the first four of the past five years  generally favorable trends in these factors led to increased activity levels in the gulf of mexico  however  declining commodity prices in the past year have caused a corresponding reduction in activity levels in the gulf of mexico 
improvements in three dimensional seismic  directional drilling  production techniques  and other advances in technology have increased drilling success rates and reduced costs 
technological improvements have also led to larger discoveries of oil and gas in subsalt geological formations which generally are located in to feet of water and in deep water to  feet areas of the gulf of mexico 
activity in water depths greater than feet  where larger structures requiring more steel tonnage are needed  has helped maintain demand on the available capacity of the major platform fabricators serving the gulf of mexico  with a resulting stability in pricing levels for their services through the end of demand for the company s products and services remained high the first four of the past five years 
the resultant backlog of projects that were built up during resulted in a strong performance for revenue in was million  a increase over revenue  and pro forma net income was million  a increase over pro forma net income 
declining oil and natural gas prices have caused a reduction in industry levels  however  and this is reflected in the company s backlog at december  which was million as compared to million at the end of despite the company s performance for the twelve months ended december   the company expects that the downturn in the industry brought on by continued low oil prices and a downturn in natural gas prices will impact the company s ability to maintain these high levels of performance beyond the dollar value of projects available in the market is significantly below last year s levels and the company s backlog is being similarly eroded 
competition for available projects has become more intense and future margins will likely be diminished 
cost reduction measures will be undertaken as appropriate to meet these conditions 
in the longer term  demand for the company s services will continue to depend largely upon prices for oil and gas  which are difficult to predict 
at some point however  it is expected that these prices should recover as supplies are reduced and the company s customers are forced to replace them 
the company has from time to time increased the average hourly wages of its employees  has subcontracted work to others on a fixed price basis and  in some years  has found it necessary to engage contract labor 
during  the company s work force ranged from approximately  to  employees  including approximately employees added through the acquisition of southport 
because the company has succeeded in increasing its production workforce through the acquisitions of southport and dolphin services and its own recruiting efforts and due to recent reduced demand for the company s products and services  the company does not anticipate the need to increase average hourly wages or engage a material amount of contract labor in the foreseeable future 
most of the company s revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours worked to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  the company would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
year issues the problem 
year issues result from the past practice in the computer industry of using two digits rather than four when coding the year portion of a date 
this practice can create breakdowns or erroneous results when computers and processors embedded in other equipment perform operations involving dates later than december  the company s state of readiness 
the company has assessed the year compliance of its information technology systems and has purchased software and hardware that it believes will be adequate to upgrade all of these systems to year compliance 
the company has also surveyed its significant non information technology equipment for year issued 
while the company uses several such items of equipment that are significant to its operations such as automated welding and cutting equipment none of the automated functions of this equipment are date sensitive and the company believes that none of the equipment will require replacement or modification for year compliance 
the company does not have any significant suppliers or customers whose information technology systems directly interface with that of the company 
nevertheless  as part of its assessment of its state of readiness  the company has surveyed a representative number of its suppliers and customers for year compliance 
to date  the company has received replies from approximately of the suppliers that it has contacted  all of which with insignificant exceptions have indicated that they have taken appropriate steps to achieve year compliance or have plans to do so 
the company has received replies from approximately of its customers contacted all of which have indicated that they have taken appropriate steps to achieve year compliance or have plans to do so 
costs 
because the company s information technology systems have been regularly upgraded and replaced as part of the company s ongoing efforts to maintain high grade technology and because the company is not heavily dependent on non information technology equipment that is date sensitive  the company s year compliance costs are expected to be relatively low 
recently the company has incurred  to purchase software and hardware to upgrade its information technology systems and management does not believe that significant additional costs will be required for year compliance 
there can be no guarantee  however  that actual costs will not exceed that amount 
risks 
while the company believes that it has taken reasonable steps to access its internal systems and prepare them for year issues  if those steps prove inadequate the company s ability to estimate and bid on new jobs and its financial and other daily business procedures could be interrupted or delayed  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
because the company s survey of its suppliers and customers is not complete  the company is not in a position to evaluate the risk of their non compliance 
it is possible that the operations of the company could be adversely affected to a material extent by the non compliance of significant suppliers or customers 
contingency plan 
while the company intends to continue to monitor year issues  it does not currently have a contingency plan for dealing with the possibility that its current systems may prove inadequate  nor does the company currently intend to develop such a plan 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the company s revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million in revenue for the year ended december  revenue increased as a result of the southport acquisition  the on going labor recruiting and retention efforts by the company which generated an increase in the volume of direct labor hours applied to contracts and the implementation of productivity enhancing equipment for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increased employment levels and the utilization of labor saving equipment enabled the company to increase volume and profit margins 
the volume of direct labor hours applied to contracts increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for gross profit increased by to million of revenue for compared to million of revenue of gross profit for the year ended december  cost of revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenue consists of cost associated with the fabrication process  including direct cost such as direct labor hours  subcontractor cost and raw materials allocated to specific jobs and indirect cost such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs that are associated with production but are not directly related to a specific project 
as a percentage of revenue  these costs decreased to for compared to for the company s general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  although general and administrative expenses increased by million  as a percentage of revenue  these expenses decreased to from of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase of million for the year was caused by the additional general and administrative costs associated with southport and the additional costs associated with increased production levels 
the company had net interest income of  for the year ended december  compared to net interest expense of  for the year ended december  the company completed its initial public offering in april  and used the proceeds to eliminate all of its outstanding bank debt and provide working capital to the company 
since that time  the company s cash provided by operations has increased to a level that has allowed the company to make capital expenditures and acquisitions with little or no debt 
the company converted to c corporation status on april  the pro forma provision for income taxes and pro forma net income give effect to federal and state income taxes as if all entities presented had been taxed as c corporations during all of pro forma net income for excludes a non recurring charge of million to record the cumulative deferred income tax provision upon the election on april  to convert from s corporation status to c corporation status 
comparison of the years ended december  and the company s revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million in revenue for the year ended december  revenue increased as a result of the acquisition of dolphin services and high activity levels in the oil and gas industry during which created increased demand and  thus  upward pressure on the pricing of the company s goods and services 
in addition  the on going labor recruiting and retention efforts at the company generated an increase in the volume of direct labor hours applied to contracts for the year ended december   compared to million in versus million in 
the combination of increased volume and strong pricing enabled the company to increase gross profit by to million of revenue for the year ended december   compared to the million of revenue of gross profit for the year ended december  cost of revenue was million in compared to million in cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the fabrication process  including direct costs such as direct labor hours and raw materials allocated to specific projects and indirect costs such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs that are associated with production but are not directly related to a specific project 
as a percentage of revenue  these costs decreased to compared to in the company s general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  although the absolute dollar cost of the company s general and administrative expenses increased by million for  as a percentage of revenue  it remained constant at 
the increase of million for the year was caused by i additional general and administrative costs associated with dolphin services  ii greater accrual of performance based employee incentives which resulted from increased profits for the year ended december   and iii additional costs associated with increased production levels and the reporting requirements of a public company for the company s net interest expense decreased to  for compared to  for as a result of the use of the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering to repay all of the company s outstanding debt and net cash provided by operations of million in  as compared to million in  the weighted average borrowings for were lower in comparison to the company converted to c corporation status on april  pro forma provision for income taxes and pro forma net income give effect to federal and state income taxes as if all entities presented had been taxed as c corporations during all the periods presented of both and pro forma net income excludes a non recurring charge of million to record the cumulative deferred income tax provision upon the election on april  to convert from s corporation status to c corporation status 
pro forma tax adjustments from april until april   the company operated as an s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes 
as a result  the company paid no federal or state income tax  and the entire earnings of the company were subject to tax directly at the shareholder level 
immediately prior to the initial public offering  the company s shareholders elected to terminate the company s s corporation status 
as a result  the company recorded a one time deferred tax liability in the amount of approximately million in the second quarter of pro forma income taxes related to operations as an s corporation for and would have been million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources historically the company has funded its business activities through funds generated from operations and borrowings under its bank credit facility 
net cash provided by operations decreased by to million for the year ended december   primarily attributable to the increased balances of accounts receivable and retainage related to increased sales 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  related to the million purchase of southport  million of capital expenditures and  of other miscellaneous items 
the company s capital expenditures were for improvements to its production facilities and for equipment designed to increase the capacity of its facilities and the productivity of its labor force 
during the company purchased four new manitowoc crawler cranes and a used american crawler crane  upgraded the shot blast facility  constructed a pressure vessel shop  installed construction skidways  and acquired various other fabrication equipment and facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities of  during represented the net proceeds of  from the issuance of stock related to option exercises and  net borrowings under the revolving line of credit the revolver 
the company s bank credit facility provides for a revolver of up to million which bears interest equal to  at the company s option  the prime lending rate established by citibank  na or libor plus at december  
the revolver matures december  and is secured by a mortgage on the company s real estate  equipment and fixtures 
the company pays a fee quarterly of three eighths of one percent per annum on the average unused portion of the line of credit 
the company is required to maintain certain covenants  including balance sheet and cash flow ratios 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
at december   the company had million borrowed under the revolver 
effective january   the company acquired all the outstanding stock of southport 
the purchase price was million in cash  plus contingent payments of up to million based on southport s net income over a four year period ending december  the initial payment of million was funded through working capital generated from operations 
no contingent payments were payable for the company s board of directors has approved a capital budget of million for  including additional bulkheading  skidway systems  and automated painting  welding and steel cutting systems 
management believes that its available funds  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures and its working capital needs 
however  the company may expand its operations through acquisitions in the future  which may require additional equity or debt financing
