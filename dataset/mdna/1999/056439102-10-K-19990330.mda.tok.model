item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  as well as our selected financial data  all appearing elsewhere herein 
statements contained in this discussion or elsewhere herein that are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  words such as believes  anticipates  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we caution you that a number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  the following continued demand for our current product lines  the success of our new product introductions  the success of our acquisition strategy  continued availability and favorable pricing of raw materials  our ability and the ability of our key vendors to successfully respond to year issues  competitive pressures  general economic conditions  and regulatory matters 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to anticipate or respond timely to changes in any of the factors listed above  which could adversely affect our operating results in one or more fiscal periods 
our operating results in any past period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
background effect of acquisitions we are pursuing a business strategy that includes acquisitions as an important element 
as described more fully below  we completed six acquisitions during the past three years  which significantly increased our product offerings and size 
annual net sales volume has increased from million actual for the fiscal year ended july  to net sales on a pro forma basis equal to million for the year ended december  our gross margin and operating margin for the fiscal year ended july   were and  respectively 
historical margins attributable to the operations of businesses acquired by us have generally been lower than margins at our platform uvex safety business 
in addition  intangible assets totaling million have been recorded subsequent to july   resulting in a significant increase in amortization expense 
integration of acquired businesses into our existing uvex safety business  and an increase in amortization expense  have each resulted in a decline in our margins from the fiscal year ended july on february   we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire perfect fit glove co  inc and certain affiliates and related assets perfect fit  manufacturers and distributors of protective gloves and other related products worldwide 
historical gross margins and operating margins of perfect fit have been lower than the consolidated margins of bacou 
although we expect our gross  operating and net profit to increase as a result of our acquisition of perfect fit  we expect that inclusion of the operating results of this business will further reduce our consolidated margins in see liquidity and capital resources 
effective february   we acquired substantially all assets and assumed substantially all liabilities of howard leight  a manufacturer of hearing protection products including disposable  reusable and banded ear plugs  and ear muffs for cash consideration of million  million of which represented the refinancing of howard leight indebtedness 
we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of comasec holdings  inc comasec on may  for cash consideration of million 
the assets of comasec consisted primarily of its wholly owned subsidiary  survivair  a manufacturer of respiratory protection products 
on september   we also acquired all of the capital stock of biosystems  a manufacturer of gas monitors and equipment for testing self contained breathing apparatus  in exchange for  shares of our common stock having a fair market value equal to million 
the initial acquisition price for biosystems may be increased if the operating results of this business in the year exceed certain defined thresholds 
finally  we acquired lase r shield for million in june of we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of titmus effective september  for approximately million and substantially all of the assets of pro tech effective march  for approximately million 
operating results for each of the above acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning with the respective acquisition dates 
certain non recurring costs  principally relating to the above acquisitions  have been included in our and operating results 
in connection with the acquisition of howard leight and certain of the acquisitions  a portion of the acquisition price was allocated to the fair value of purchased in process research and development 
these amounts  totaling million in and million in  were charged to operating expenses in full upon the date of acquisition 
in connection with each of the acquisitions  acquired inventories were adjusted to fair values  and these adjustments were subsequently charged to cost of sales when the acquired inventories were sold 
these amounts were equal to million in and million in we paid cash bonuses in the amount of million to certain senior executives of howard leight in connection with that acquisition  which have been included with general and administrative expenses 
we also recorded acquisition related charges during totaling  that are included with general and administrative expenses 
the following discussion provides an analysis of our actual operating results  and also analyzes our operating results excluding the effect of these acquisition related items 
results of operations the following table presents selected operating data of bacou and such amounts as percentages of net sales for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentages 
year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses selling    general and administrative    research and development   purchased in process research and development   amortization of intangible assets    total operating expenses    operating income    other expense income  net  income before income taxes    income taxes    net income    includes acquisition related costs totaling  of net sales for the year ended december   and  of net sales for the year ended december  includes acquisition related charges totaling  of net sales for the year ended december   and non recurring charges for termination benefits totaling  of net sales and acquisition related bonuses totaling  of net sales for the year ended december  amounts for all periods represent acquisition related charges for acquired in process research and development 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our net sales increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net sales in our safety segment increased from million in to million in  principally the result of acquired businesses and new product introductions  while net sales in our optical frames and instruments segment declined by from million in to million in export sales represented of net sales in and of net sales in  and increased by from to due principally to acquired businesses 
of the million increase in net sales of safety products  million was the result of acquired businesses 
operating results of howard leight were included for ten months in and results of survivair and biosystems were included for the full year in  compared to the period  which only included survivair for seven months and biosystems for three months 
the remaining growth in sales of safety products of was principally the result of new product introductions  including uvex r lines of astrospec protective eyewear with the colors and logos of national football league teams  bandit and bandido protective eyewear  the survivair series air purifying respirator line  and the panther self contained breathing apparatus 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of higher sales volume 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  excluding acquisition related items  our gross margin was approximately in both and because of relatively higher margins attributable to hearing protection products  our acquisition of the howard leight business has improved our overall gross margin 
this improvement however  was offset by the effect of our acquisition of the biosystems and survivair businesses  due to the lower margins attributable to respiratory and gas monitor products 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of operating expenses attributable to acquired businesses 
in june  we announced the termination of employment of the president and chief operating officer of bacou safety 
the period includes a charge equal to million for termination payments due to this former officer 
in addition  the period includes acquisition related charges for acquired in process research and development totaling million and acquisition related bonuses totaling million 
the period also includes acquisition related charges for acquired in process research and development totaling million 
excluding these charges  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to higher levels of spending for research and development at acquired businesses and increased amortization expense 
amortization expense increased from million in to million in as a result of additions to intangible assets in connection with businesses we recently acquired 
operating income 
our operating income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  excluding acquisition related items in both years and excluding the termination benefits discussed above  our operating income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  and our operating margin declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  other expense income  net 
other expense income  net was  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the period includes net interest expense totaling million  whereas the period includes net interest income totaling 
the increase in net interest expense from to is due principally to debt we incurred in connection with the acquisition of howard leight 
see liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in and in our effective rate in both periods was higher than the federal statutory rate of due to state and local income taxes 
in addition  our effective rate in the period was higher because a tax benefit could not be recorded for charges totaling million and relating to acquired in process research and development 
net income 
our net income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  excluding acquisition related items in both years and excluding the termination benefits discussed above  our net income increased from million in to million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our net sales increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net sales of our safety segment increased from million in to million in  while net sales of our optical frames and instruments segment declined from million in to million in export sales represented of net sales in and of net sales in  and increased by from to net sales of safety products increased principally as a result of acquired businesses  as the acquisitions of biosystems and survivair contributed incremental sales totaling million 
during the fourth quarter of we withdrew from the business of selling completed prescription eyewear  and as a result  net sales of our optical frames and instruments segment declined from the period to the period by approximately million 
excluding the effect of businesses acquired in  and excluding sales in from discontinued product lines  our net sales increased by  principally as a result of increased units shipped 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volume and acquisition related costs resulting from the acquisitions of biosystems and survivair 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  excluding the effect of acquisition related items  our gross margin would have been in compared with in our gross margin declined from to principally as a result of lower margins at acquired businesses 
during we also experienced a reduction in the average selling price of many of our protective eyewear product lines as a response to lower priced competitive products 
lower average selling prices resulted in a reduction of the gross margin from to of about one percentage point 
we believe competitive pressures may limit our ability to increase prices to previous levels 
in addition to these factors  our gross margin during was reduced as a result of higher costs to produce eyeglass frames and components 
these higher costs occurred primarily during the first quarter of and resulted from disruption in production caused by relocation to a new facility and  interruption in production and quality problems both associated with a newly acquired plating line 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  excluding acquisition related charges for acquired in process research and development totaling million  operating expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted principally from operating expenses attributable to biosystems and survivair  each acquired by us during in addition  selling expenses as a percentage of sales increased from in to in  principally as a result of expansion of our international sales force  higher advertising and promotion costs  and somewhat higher product development costs 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing  our operating income decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  excluding acquisition related items  operating income decreased from million in to million in other expense income  net 
other expense income  net was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  we had lower average levels of debt outstanding during the period  and the change in other expense income is primarily due to a decline in net interest expense from to income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in and in our effective rate in both periods was higher than the federal statutory rate due to state and local income taxes and  in the period  because a tax benefit could not be recorded for charges totaling million and relating to acquired in process research and development 
excluding the effect of these charges  our effective income tax rate for would have been 
net income 
primarily as a result of acquisition related items  our net income decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  excluding acquisition related items  our net income increased from million in to million in effects of inflation inflation during recent years has been modest and has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity historically has been derived from cash flow provided by operations and  periodically  from bank borrowings utilized to finance acquisitions of businesses 
we utilize ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as a measure of our cash flow provided by operations 
our ebitda prior to the effect of non recurring items increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was principally due to inclusion of the operating results of acquired businesses 
we used cash equal to million for working capital purposes during the year ended december  our net use of cash for working capital purposes resulted principally from increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
our accounts receivable balances were higher at december  than at december  principally as a result of sales volume during the fourth quarter of that was substantially higher than the comparable period in inventory levels increased from to principally due to planned increases in response to higher order rates and due to initial stocking for new product introductions 
we used cash equal to million during the year ended december   and million during the year ended december   for investing activities 
the year ended december   includes cash payments totaling million that we made in connection with the acquisition of howard leight 
we made cash payments for the acquisition of survivair  totaling million  during the year ended december  our capital expenditures totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in connection with our acquisition of biosystems we provided former shareholders of biosystems put options covering  shares issued in connection with that acquisition 
the put options may be exercised at any time through september   at a price equal to approximately per share 
if the put options were exercised in full  we would be required to make cash payments totaling approximately million to repurchase these shares  and we expect that such payment would be funded by bank borrowings 
in february we entered into an agreement with banque nationale de paris pursuant to which the bank made a term loan the bnp loan in the principal amount of million 
the bnp loan requires quarterly interest payments at an effective annual rate equal to three month libor plus and requires principal repayments in equal quarterly installments over seven years 
we also maintain a million revolving line of credit facility the revolving facility with citizens bank of rhode island 
the revolving facility is available to fund acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes  bears interest at a rate per annum equal to three month libor plus and is due in full on may  in connection with our acquisition of howard leight we borrowed a total of million  consisting of the million bnp loan and million on the revolving facility 
we repaid principal during the year ended december   equal to million 
principal repayments consisted of payments totaling million on the bnp loan and million of indebtedness we assumed in connection with the acquisition of howard leight 
at december   we had debt outstanding totaling million consisting of million on the bnp loan and million on the revolving facility 
we have entered into an agreement to acquire perfect fit for an approximate purchase price of million in cash plus the assumption of the sellers balance sheet liabilities  currently estimated at million 
we expect this acquisition will close on or about april   and anticipate borrowing an amount approximating the cash purchase price from banque nationale de paris 
we expect the loan would be a seven year term loan  with equal quarterly installments of principal and with an effective annual interest rate equal to three month libor plus approximately 
we are pursuing a business strategy that includes acquisitions as an important element 
as a result  we may incur additional indebtedness  may be required to negotiate additional credit facilities  or may issue additional common or preferred stock in order to fund potential future investments resulting from our acquisition strategy 
we believe we would have access to sufficient capital to consummate future acquisitions in addition to the perfect fit acquisition 
except for cash requirements to fund acquisitions  we believe that our cash flow provided by operating activities together with unused borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  debt service requirements and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
seasonality our business has been subject to slight seasonal variations  which we have attributed to fluctuations in industrial activity and annual weather patterns 
historically  our sales from october through december have been somewhat lower than other periods due to anticipated lower demand in the more inclement winter months and planned inventory reductions by major distributors 
in addition to seasonality  our business has been variable period to period due to other factors  including promotional activity undertaken by certain of our business units in response to competitive pressures  market demand  production capacity  inventory levels and other considerations 
year compliance many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without consideration of the impact of the upcoming change in century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results at or before the year we initiated a comprehensive project in june to address our year compliance 
the project consists of four phases including assessment phase identification of areas of non compliance based upon a combination of our own analysis and direct communication with vendors that developed and support our software and evaluation of risk  planning phase development of specific steps to correct non compliance  including a timetable  implementation phase execution of steps developed during the planning phase  and testing phase conducting tests to validate year compliance 
the project considers both our primary information systems software for all financial systems  network software and equipment  personal computers and incumbent software  etc 
and other applications dependent upon embedded software manufacturing equipment  telephone systems  security systems  etc we have completed the assessment and planning phases of this project 
results of the assessment phase initially identified applications  principally at our survivair and uvex safety divisions  which were not year compliant 
during  we initiated a project to install and implement common software at all of our business units and we signed a license agreement with jd edwards company for such software in september full implementation of this software was completed at our survivair division on january   and we expect that full implementation at our uvex safety division will be completed during the second quarter of jd edwards company has represented that this software is year compliant and that its processes used to achieve year readiness are certified by the information technology association of america 
we believe that implementation of this software at our survivair division has corrected its material year deficiencies  and further believe that upon full implementation of this software at our uvex safety division we will have corrected all of our remaining material year deficiencies  except any that exist at perfect fit which we will address following consummation of the acquisition 
we have incurred costs totaling approximately million through december  for implementation of the software at our survivair and uvex safety business units  and we estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete full implementation to be approximately million 
except for the cost of training  these costs will be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software 
the cost of training is estimated to be million and will be expensed as incurred 
although there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete implementation of the common software at our uvex safety business unit by dates critical for year compliance  implementation is currently progressing in accordance with timetables established by us 
although failure to complete implementation on a timely basis may have material adverse financial and operational impacts on us  we believe such failure is not reasonably likely 
we believe the possible effects of unsuccessful implementation of this software by our uvex safety division would be temporary and may include the following for that business an inability to process transactions  an inability to order raw materials  an inability to timely process orders and billings  or an inability to deliver finished products to customers 
the implementation phase for other applications with embedded software is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of the cost of modifying or correcting deficiencies in these applications is currently estimated to be immaterial and such costs will principally be expensed as incurred 
our business is also dependent upon the systems of third parties 
with the exception of a few significant vendors  we believe that year deficiencies in these systems would not represent a material financial or business risk to us 
with regard to these few vendors  we are assessing their year readiness based upon direct communication with each such vendor 
we believe that the most reasonably likely worst case result relating to year would be the failure of certain applications with embedded software  or failure of third party systems on which our systems rely 
failure of applications with embedded software could result in temporary disruption to an aspect of our operations  such as disruption in operation of certain manufacturing equipment 
failure of the information systems of a vendor could result in the temporary interruption of supply of material or services required by us 
although there can be no assurance that these failures would not have an adverse effect on our business  we believe the effect of such failure would not be material to our business 
we have developed informal contingency plans relating to any such failure  which include reliance upon redundant systems  short term reliance upon manual systems and reliance upon alternate vendors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk can result from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market exposures 
uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax  other regulatory or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of our market risks 
we believe our only market risk exposure is the risk of adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   we had debt outstanding totaling million consisting of million on the bnp loan and million on the revolving facility 
interest rates on this debt are variable based upon three month libor 
three month libor approximated at december we have prepared sensitivity analyses of our interest rate exposure for to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based upon the results of these analyses  a adverse change in interest rates from the december  rate would result in a reduction of our after tax earnings of approximately  or per share
