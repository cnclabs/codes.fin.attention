item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction mmt is a medical device and drug delivery system company focusing on early intervention healthcare and emergency medical technologies 
the company has three areas of business 
the injectable drug delivery systems business focuses on injectable drug delivery devices with an emphasis on commercial auto injectors 
this business also supplies customized drug delivery system design  pharmaceutical research and development  and sterile product manufacturing to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the cardiopulmonary systems business focuses on non invasive cardiac diagnostics and telemedicine 
the cardiopulmonary systems business is beginning the european distribution phase for the prime ecg system  an lead cardiac mapping system designed for rapid and improved diagnostic accuracy of cardiac ischemia 
multiple distributors in major western european markets are being targeted and  subject to the completion of negotiations and execution of distribution agreements  will become distributors of the system over the coming months 
a us based fda clinical study of the prime ecg system will begin in november meridian intends to complete the us clinical study by the fourth quarter of fiscal subject to a successful completion of the clinical  a k application will be made to the fda for approval to market the product in the us the company  through shahal  is also planning a us expansion of its telemedicine business 
the government systems business focuses on the world wide market for auto injectors used for self administration of nerve agent antidotes  morphine and diazepam  and markets to the us and allied governments  as well as local governments for civil defense applications 
results of operations compared with mmt s net loss after taxes for the year ended july  was  per share on revenues of million compared to a fiscal net loss of  per share on revenues of million 
included in the net loss for was a fourth quarter charge of  for the epipen recall  and included in the net loss for were charges of million for the epipen recall and  for the extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment 
gross margins decreased to in compared to in this decrease reflects the impact of supplying free units of epipen as a result of the epipen recall 
operating expenses decreased by from to  excluding the recall charges from and this reduction reflects planned cost reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income and ebitda were and million  respectively  in  down from and million in due to the gross margin decline associated with the recall 
the company has estimated results excluding the impact of the epipen recall and the epiezpen voluntary exchange program for the years ended july  and as follows in thousands impact of the epipen recall and the epiezpen voluntary reported results exchange program estimated results the year ended july  net sales    operating income    loss income before income taxes    the year ended july  net sales    operating income    income before income taxes and extraordinary loss   the table above removes the estimated impact of the epipen recall and the epiezpen voluntary exchange program from actual reported results 
the impact includes lost sales and gross margins due to free units supplied to reimburse for cash costs  as well as the actual expense provided 
the above analysis does not quantify the impact that the free units supplied for replacement purposes had on sales and gross margins 
drug delivery business sales were million in  lower than resulting from free units of epipen supplied to satisfy replacement units and cash costs relating to the epipen recall 
government business sales were million  higher than as sales to the us department of defense dod and civilian defense customers continued to grow 
cardiopulmonary sales were million in  higher than reflecting increased telemedicine sales  primarily the cardiobeeper product 
gross margins were of sales in compared to in the decreased gross margins from to resulted primarily from recall obligations 
the company shipped  free epipens in fiscal  both for actual units returned and to reimburse the distributor for cash costs 
while the direct cost of these free units was fully reserved in  the lost revenue from those units caused the gross margin to decline 
the company has provided  in the fourth quarter of fiscal for what it believes to be the final costs of the recall

the company continues to have significant operating loss carryforwards as explained in note to the financial statements 
line of business discussion drug delivery sales were million in  lower than in due to free units of epipen supplied to satisfy obligations from the may  product recall 
the company produced and shipped in excess of million epipens in fiscal   of which were for recall obligations and were non revenue generating 
of the  units  a portion were to replace actual units returned  and the remainder were to reimburse for cash costs incurred by the distributor 
the reserve provisions exclude any impact from lower sales revenue and resulting lower margins because the company is reimbursing recall costs with free epipen units instead of cash reimbursement 
it is estimated that the delivery of epipen units to reimburse recall cash costs depressed revenues by million 
r d services and contract filling both had an increase in revenues from to  including the initial shipment to mylan laboratories of acyclovir  contributing toward this business unit s results 
government revenues increased by in over the prior year to million 
the increase resulted from higher sales to the dod under the ibmc contract  as well as sales to local municipalities for civil defense domestic preparedness applications

the contract calls for the retention by the company of key personnel and facilities to assure expertise for manufacturing auto injectors containing nerve agent antidotes  the storage of serviceable material from expired auto injectors  the management of the us army s shelf life extension program  the pre stocking of critical components to enhance readiness and mobilization capability  and new product orders 
this contract is expected to generate at least million in revenues in fiscal cardiopulmonary product revenues in were million  an increase from sales of million 
the increase was due to higher telemedicine sales  specifically the cardiobeeper and cardiopocket products 
significant activities in the cardiopulmonary business is focused on moving the prime ecg system from the development phase towards market introduction 
sensitivity and specificity results continue to improve and are currently above expectations 
a ce mark was received in  approving the product for sale in europe  and a distribution network in western europe is presently being developed 
us clinical trials will begin in november and  subject to the successful completion  fda approval is expected in late fiscal the company capitalized  in for software development costs relating to prime

borrowings under the working capital line were million leaving million available credit at july  the company is exploring financing options to provide additional sources of capital and or potentially refinancing all or a portion of its existing long term debt 
inflation in the view of management  the low levels of inflation in recent years and changing prices have had no significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
generally  the company is able to mitigate the effects of inflation on operating costs and expenses through price increases and productivity gains 
year the company s program the company has undertaken a program to address the year issue yk with respect to the following i the company s information technology and operating systems including its billing  accounting and financial reporting systems  ii the company s non information technology systems such as buildings  plant  equipment and other infrastructure systems that may contain embedded micro controller technology  iii certain systems of the company s major suppliers and material service providers insofar as such systems relate to the company s business activities with such parties  and iv the company s major distributors insofar as the year issue relates to the ability of such distributors to distribute the company s products 
as described below  the company s year program involves i an assessment of the year problems that may affect the company  ii the development of remedies to address the problems discovered in the assessment phase  iii the testing of such remedies and iv the preparation of contingency plans to deal with worst case scenarios 
assessment phase as part of the assessment phase of its program  the company has attempted to identify substantially all of the major components of the systems described above 
in order to determine the extent to which such systems are vulnerable to the year issue  a yk three tier matrix was applied to mmt systems 
tier one systems are mission critical and tier two systems are critical business operations 
mission critical tier can be defined as extended downtime hr 
for or more employees 
downtime for employees lasting from to hours is categorized as critical tier 
the last tier  three  is for productivity systems that are important to the ongoing improvement of the business  mmt however  could operate without these systems for a period of time days 
remediation and testing phase based upon the results of its assessment efforts  the company has undertaken remediation and testing activities which are intended to address potential year problems in computer software used by the company in its information technology and non information technology systems in an attempt to demonstrate that this software will be made substantially year compliant on a timely basis 
in this phase  the company first evaluated a program application and  if a potential year problem was identified  it took steps to remediate the problem and individually test the application to confirm that the remediating changes were effective and did not adversely affect the functionality of that application 
it was determined that all mmt systems had a completed plan and are yk compliant  as of the date of this filing  with the exception of minor remediation efforts that will be completed during november the following summarizes the efforts being made a 
mmt will not risk the possibility of downtime based on vendor assurances of yk compliant systems in tier and systems 
yk has been completed for all tier systems 
one tier item is in its final phase of remediation that will be completed during november b 
mmt is a medium sized company with packaged software purchased from reliable vendors 
yk compliant programs are supplied by the vendor 
c 
mmt has no tier or systems which are proprietary or custom designed that need to be fixed internally 
all new systems have passed an internal yk validation for tier  and d 
all tier and systems are supported by vendor contracts or through excellent relationships with mmt 
all contracts for tier and systems are through the year e 
vendors supplying components or plcs have submitted documentation to mmt concerning their yk compliance 
f 
programmable logic controllers plc  lab and testing equipment used with machinery that produces mmt product could malfunction and stop production 
all plcs  lab and testing equipment is yk compliant or in the final phase of remediation that will be completed during november g 
low risk tier systems have been addressed 
yk compliance will be completed for tier during november with the above items completed by november  mmt will still be dependent on some suppliers  such as utility and telecommunication companies 
to address this risk  mmt s current forecast and orders have been adjusted with our customers input 
mmt believes that all customer orders will be unaffected during the transition to the year contingency plans the company developed a contingency plan to handle its most likely worst case year non compliant scenarios 
the sales forecast was then adjusted to reflect these scenarios 
costs related to the year issue to date  the company s costs  which have been expensed as incurred  have amounted to  additional costs to be incurred in the future are not expected to exceed  the costs and timetable in which the company completes the year readiness activities are based on management s best estimates  which are derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party readiness plans and other factors 
the company can make no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ from such plans 
risks related to the year issue although the company s year efforts are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the year issue on the company s business and operations  the actual effects of the issue and the success or failure of the company s efforts described above cannot be known until the year occurs 
failure by the company and its major suppliers  other material service providers and major distributors to address adequately their respective year issues in a timely manner insofar as such issues relate to the company s business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies  as a result of transactions in foreign markets 
at july   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s transactions are denominated would have resulted in an increase in operating income of approximately  for the year ended july  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors services become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
while the company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its outstanding debt  the company does not currently utilize any derivative financial instruments related to its interest rate exposure 
total short term and long term debt outstanding at july  was million  consisting of million in variable rate borrowing and million in fixed rate borrowing 
at this level of variable rate borrowing  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have decreased pre tax earnings by approximately  for the year ended july  at july   the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt outstanding was estimated at million 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt
