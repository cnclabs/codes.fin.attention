item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s results of operations are affected primarily by conditions affecting offshore drilling contractors  including the level of offshore drilling activity by oil and gas companies 
the level of offshore drilling is affected by a number of factors  including prevailing and expected oil and natural gas prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and overseas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  local and international political and economic conditions and the ability of oil and gas companies to access or generate capital sufficient to fund capital expenditures for offshore  exploration  development and production activities 
despite declines in oil and natural gas prices over the past year  worldwide offshore drilling activity has remained relatively high over the past few years 
according to offshore data services  inc as of february   the utilization rate of the worldwide fleet of offshore mobile drilling units was 
while this rate represents a decline from the utilization rate of one year ago  it is only slightly less than the utilization rate of five years ago 
this level of drilling activity is generally attributed to a number of recent industry trends  including three dimensional seismic mapping  directional drilling and other advances in technology that have increased drilling success rates and efficiency and have led to the discoveries of oil and gas in subsalt geological formations which generally are located in depths of to feet of water and deepwater areas of the gulf of mexico 
in the deepwater areas where larger and more technically advanced drilling rigs are needed  increased drilling activity resulted in increased demand for newly constructed semisubmersible drilling rigs and for retrofitting offshore drilling rigs 
during the second half of calendar  worldwide orders for the construction of new offshore drilling rigs declined 
however  the company has maintained a significant contract backlog of deepwater related projects 
at december   the company s backlog was approximately million 
the company s backlog at december  was approximately million  of which over million was related to deepwater projects 
in addition  in february  the company was awarded a million contract for the new construction of a friede goldman  ltd 
designed millennium sa semisubmersible offshore drilling rig 
the contract is subject to the securing of rig financing by the owner 
to accommodate its rapid growth  the company has leased additional acreage adjacent to fgo west s existing shipyard in pascagoula  mississippi  that provides it with additional dock space and covered fabrication capacity 
in addition  the company has completed construction of a state of the art shipyard  also in pascagoula  mississippi  that is capable of constructing new offshore drilling rigs and production units as well as converting  retrofitting and repairing existing offshore drilling rigs and production units 
the new facility fgo east formerly known as the greenwood island facility began generating revenue in the first quarter of and became fully operational in the third quarter 
further  the company has increased its workforce from approximately employees at december  to approximately  employees at december  in january the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets of a shipyard and fabrication facility in marystown  newfoundland the marystown facility 
the marystown facility expanded the company s capacity for new construction as well as retrofit and repair of offshore drilling rigs and production units 
also  in february  the company acquired a company located near nantes  france  that designs and manufactures mooring  anchoring  rack and pinion jacking systems and cargo handling equipment 
this additional capacity is expected to help the company in meeting the anticipated increase in demand for such equipment as components of new and modified offshore drilling rigs 
due to general declines in oil and gas prices during  demand for offshore drilling rigs has declined and  as a result  dayrates earned by drilling contractors have also declined 
while the company s backlog remains strong  it is possible that continued low oil and gas prices could result in a further decline in demand for deepwater drilling rigs and  as a result  dayrates for rigs could also decline further 
substantially all of the contracts included in the company s backlog at december  relate to deepwater drilling rigs 
some of these contracts are subject to cancellation by the customers  however  the company has had no indication that any of its contracts might be cancelled 
at december   the company has paid or committed approximately million for the manufacture of certain jackup rig components 
as noted above  demand for new construction of jackup drilling rigs has declined 
however  management of the company believes that contracts for new construction  modification or repairs will be secured that will utilize these components and permit the company to realize its investment in the components 
the company generally performs conversion  retrofit and repair services pursuant to contracts that provide for a portion of the work to be performed on a fixed price basis and a portion of the work to be performed on a cost plus basis 
in addition  the scope of the services to be performed with respect to a particular drilling rig often increases as the project progresses due to additional retrofits or modifications requested by the customer or additional repair work necessary to meet the safety or environmental standards established by the coast guard or other regulatory authorities 
with respect to the fixed price portions of a project  the company receives the negotiated contract price  subject to adjustment only for change orders placed by the customer 
as a result  under fixed price arrangements  the company retains all cost savings but is also responsible for all cost over runs 
under cost plus arrangements  the company receives specified amounts in excess of its direct labor and materials cost so that it is protected against cost overruns but does not benefit from cost savings 
the cost and productivity of the company s labor force are primary factors affecting the company s operating profits 
accordingly  control by the company of the cost and productivity of direct labor hours worked on its projects is essential 
the company believes that the access to information provided by its project management system allows it to effectively manage its current projects as well as to negotiate contracts on new projects on a profitable basis 
the company s operations are subject to variations from quarter to quarter and year to year resulting from fluctuations in demand for the company s services and  due to the large amounts of revenue that are typically derived from a small quantity of projects  the timing of the receipt of awards for new projects 
in addition  the company schedules projects based on the timing of available capacity to perform the services requested and  to the extent that there are delays in the arrival of a drilling rig or production unit into the shipyard  the company generally is not able to utilize the excess capacity created by such delays 
although the company may be able to offset the effect of such delays through adjustments to the size of its skilled labor force on a temporary basis  such delays may adversely affect the company s results of operations in any period in which such delays occur 
the company s revenue on contracts is earned on the percentage of completion method which is based upon the percentage that incurred costs to date  excluding the costs of any purchased but uninstalled materials  bear to total estimated costs 
accordingly  contract price and costs estimates are reviewed periodically as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require such adjustments become known 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are identified 
other changes  including those arising from the contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  the company would report such a change by recognizing a charge against current earnings  which might be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
cost of revenue includes costs associated with the fabrication process and can be further broken down between direct costs such as direct labor hours and raw materials allocated to specific projects and indirect costs such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs that are associated with production but are not directly related to a specific project 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and during the year ended december   the company generated revenue of million  an increase of  compared to the million generated for the year ended december  this increase was caused by an increase in demand for conversion and retrofit services related to deep water offshore drilling rigs  revenues of approximately million attributable to the completion and outfitting of an existing semisubmersible drilling rig hull  approximately million of revenues attributable to the new construction of semi submersible drilling rigs  and revenues of approximately million generated by the company s marystown facility and french operations 
cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   resulting in an increase in gross profit from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues can be explained as follows the new build construction of semisubmersible offshore drilling rigs generally results in lower gross margin percentages than those generated from repair and retrofit work  the company earned smaller margin percentages on contracts assumed upon the acquisition of the marystown facility  and margin percentages earned on equipment sales from the company s french operations  while typically higher than margins earned on new build construction are generally less than those earned from repair and retrofit work 
management expects that gross margins  as a percentage of revenues  may trend lower as a more significant portion of the company s total revenues is derived from the new construction of offshore drilling rigs and from sales of equipment 
such lower gross margin percentages result from a higher dollar volume of lower margin material and subcontract costs included in costs of revenues  and from a greater portion of the total project being performed on a fixed price basis 
gross margins on repair and retrofit projects also vary based on  among other things  the size of the project undertaken 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses reflects an increase in sales and administrative workforce and facilities due to overall growth of the company s business  the additional administrative costs associated with international activities and costs associated with being a publicly held corporation 
operating income increased by million from the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased revenue and gross profit discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
net interest income interest income less interest expense declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased interest expense attributable to borrowings related to fgo east and equipment additions in the existing fgo west yard 
the change in other income expense is primarily attributable to miscellaneous items  none of which are individually material 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  reflects a composite income tax rate of approximately including foreign taxes of approximately million 
the actual and proforma provision for income taxes for the year ended december   reflects a combined federal and state tax rate of 
the decline in the overall rate for the year ended december  is the result of available state income tax credits related to increased employment levels at the company s pascagoula  mississippi locations 
comparison of the years ended december  and during the year ended december   the company generated revenue of million  an increase of  compared to the million generated in this increase was caused primarily by an increase in demand for conversion and retrofit services and a general increase in the size of the conversion and modification projects in as compared to cost of revenue was million in compared to million in  resulting in an increase in gross profit from million in to million in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the type of work being completed in compared to during  a greater portion of the projects performed consisted of conversion and retrofit projects  compared to primarily repair and inspection projects completed in conversion and retrofit projects generally provide higher profit margins than repair and inspection projects 
in addition  during  f g ltd 
completed a major design project for a customer that resulted in higher gross profits than those earned in sg a expense were million in compared to million in the increase in sg a expenses reflects an increase in administrative workforce and facilities due to overall growth of the company s business and costs associated with being a publicly held corporation 
operating income increased by million from to primarily as a result of increased revenue and enhanced profit margins discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
net interest income interest income less interest expense was million in compared to net interest expense of million in this change reflects the favorable cash flows of the company which have provided capital sufficient to sustain current operations  reducing the need to draw on its credit facilities 
cash flow was further enhanced by the company s initial public offering which provided million in cash to the company 
during  the company realized gains of approximately million as a result of the distribution of certain appreciated assets not used in the business to the stockholder of one of the predecessors 
also  gains of approximately million resulted from the sale of real estate held for investment 
the gain on the asset sales in the year ended december  related primarily to the sale of marketable securities 
during  the company received approximately million in proceeds from the settlement of a lawsuit filed in related to a contract 
settlement proceeds of approximately million were received in related to another contract 
the provision for income taxes for represents income tax expense for the period subsequent to the termination of the predecessors status as s corporations  plus a one time charge of approximately million attributable to the initial recording of a net deferred tax liability 
the pro forma provision for income taxes is the result of the application of a combined federal and state tax rate of to estimated taxable income for the period prior to termination of s corporation status 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its business activities through funds generated from operations  a credit facility secured by accounts receivable  and long term borrowings secured by assets acquired with proceeds from such borrowings 
net cash provided by operations was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
accounts receivable and inventory related to contracts as of december  have increased significantly over amounts outstanding at december  while  at the same time  billing in excess of revenues and estimated profits on several large projects being in progress have declined causing the decline in operating cash flow 
during the year ended december   the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures primarily related to the overall expansion of the company s business activities 
of the total  million was expended for facilities and related additional equipment 
million was also expended for furniture and fixtures and million was related to building improvements 
in addition  in february   approximately million was expended for the acquisition of the company s french subsidiary 
the capital expenditures and acquisition costs were funded from operating cash flow  proceeds from the initial public offering  the marad arrangement and the million and million debt facilities discussed below 
in march   fgo entered into a credit facility the credit facility which provided for borrowings of up to million  subject to a borrowing base limitation equal to of eligible receivables 
the credit facility is secured by contract related receivables 
during  the borrowing capacity under the credit facility was increased to million and was extended until march  at december   million was the outstanding balance under the credit facility and million was available 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest equal to the lender s prime lending rate plus per annum 
at december   the interest rate under the credit facility was per annum 
the credit facility contains a number of restrictions  including a provision that would prohibit the payment of dividends by fgo to the company in the event that fgo defaults under the terms of the facility 
in addition  the company must maintain certain minimum net worth and working capital levels and ratios and debt to equity ratios 
the company has signed a commitment letter with the bank for million credit facility that would provide up to million in receivable based credit and a million capital expenditure and acquisition facility that can be converted to a year term loan upon termination of the facility 
other terms and restrictions of the million facility are similar to the existing facility 
as a source of borrowing for expansion  the united states maritime administration marad provided its guarantee for million of bonds issued by the company 
the proceeds from the sale of marad guaranteed bonds were used for capital expenditures relating to constructing and equipping the company s fgo east facility 
borrowings under the marad facility are secured by the fgo east facility  bear interest at and are repayable over years 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under the marad facility 
during  the company entered into an million equipment financing arrangement 
amounts borrowed bear interest at and are being repaid in quarterly installments of  plus interest through march the balance outstanding at december  was million 
during december  the company issued million of year mississippi business finance corporation taxable industrial development revenue bonds the mbfc bonds 
the bonds require annual principle and interest of approximately million 
the proceeds from both the million equipment facility and the million mbfc bonds were used to purchase equipment primarily cranes and welding related equipment and a floating dry dock 
the borrowings are secured by the equipment purchased 
during  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan under which the company could repurchase shares of its common stock in open market transactions with an aggregate fair value of up to  through december   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate of approximately million 
the company utilized a million short term credit facility provided by an investment banking firm to finance a portion of the purchases 
no amounts were outstanding under that arrangement as of december  in july  the company completed an initial public offering the offering of  shares of its common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
proceeds from the offering have been used to finance a portion of the company s expansion of its fgo west shipyard  the new fgo east facility  and the acquisition of the french operations and for working capital 
at december   the company had invested approximately million in an unconsolidated subsidiary ilion llc in which the company currently owns a equity interest 
the company s ownership interest in ilion llc is expected to be reduced to 
ilion llc owns a hull for a semi submersible drilling rig that requires substantial completion and outfitting 
the company and the other member of ilion llc who is also one of the company s largest customers are considering various options for formal arrangements related to the hull  including financing of the completion  securing a contract for utilization or sale of the rig  or other options 
the company s investment in ilion llc was financed through cash flow from operations 
other than the initial purchase of the drilling rig hull  ilion llc has had no significant activity as of december  the company s investment in ilion llc is accounted for using the equity method 
management believes that cash generated by operating activities  and funds available under its various credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its capital expenditure requirements and its working capital needs at current levels of activity 
management of the company has historically been able to manage cash flow from construction contracts in such a manner as to minimize the need for short term contract related borrowings 
however  in light of the significant increase in revenues during  additional debt financing or equity financing may be required if the company continues to significantly increase its conversion  retrofit and repair business or obtains significant additional orders to construct new drilling rigs or production units 
although the company believes that  under such circumstances  it would be able to obtain additional financing  there can be no assurance that any additional debt or equity financing will be available to the company for these purposes or  if available  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
as noted above  the company has experienced rapid growth during the past two years 
during this period  construction was completed on the fgo east facility  an initial public offering of common stock was completed and the company s employment level  revenues and backlog increased significantly 
the company has also invested in an equity ownership in an unconsolidated subsidiary that owns a semi submersible drilling rig  and  unlike prior operations  the company has incurred costs related to construction or fabrication of rig components for which no specific customer has committed 
in addition  in early  the company completed the acquisition of foreign entities in canada and france 
these changes in and significant expansion of the company s operation  expose the company to additional business and operating risks and uncertainties 
year yk many software applications  hardware and equipment and embedded chip systems identify dates using only the last two digits of the year 
these products may be unable to distinguish between dates in the year and dates in the year that inability  if not addressed  could cause applications  equipment or systems to fail or provide incorrect information after december   or when using dates after december  this in turn could have an adverse effect on the company  due to the company s direct dependence on its own applications  equipment and systems and indirect dependence on those of other entities with which the company must interact 
compliance program 
in order to address the yk issue  the company has implemented a yk compliance plan to coordinate the five phases of yk remediation 
those phases include awareness  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation of necessary modifications 
the company has made all applicable levels of its organization aware of the yk issue and of the company s plans to assure yk compliance 
in connection with the rapid expansion of the company s business activities  the company  with the assistance of third party consultants  has conducted an overall assessment of its computer and information systems needs 
as a result of such assessment  the company has begun implementation of an expanded and upgraded information system 
the new system  which will be yk compliant  includes upgraded software and hardware and will involve the outsourcing of certain data processing functions 
implementation of the new system is scheduled to be substantially complete for the company s domestic operations during the third quarter of as part of the implementation process  the new system will be tested for yk compliance 
implementation of the system s applications at the company s international locations will follow the domestic implementation  but will not be complete prior to the year with respect to the company s domestic non financial systems applications  and its international financial and non financial systems  the company has initiated a review and testing program to assess the yk compliance of the systems currently in place 
such review will determine the nature and impact of the year issue for hardware and equipment  embedded chip systems  and third party developed software 
the review involves  among other things  obtaining representations and assurances from third parties  including third party vendors  that their hardware and equipment  embedded chip systems  and software being used by or impacting the company are or will be modified to be yk compliant 
the company s non it systems primarily consist of equipment with embedded technology and computer assisted design software 
the company is in the process of completing its preliminary assessment of all date sensitive components 
upon completion of its assessment  the company will replace or modify any non compliant non it systems as necessary 
company s state of readiness 
as noted above  the company expects that implementation of its new information systems at its domestic locations will be complete before the end of the third quarter of nevertheless  the company is currently testing its existing domestic information systems for yk compliance and expects to have such testing completed by the end of the second quarter of the review of yk compliance at international locations and for domestic non financial applications is underway 
as previously noted  the review involves soliciting responses from third parties concerning yk compliance of their products 
to date  the responses from such third parties are inconclusive 
as a result  management cannot predict the potential consequences if these or other third parties are not yk compliant 
management expects that the review  testing  and any required remediation will be completed by the end of the third quarter of costs to address year compliance issues 
the costs of acquiring and implementing the company s expanded and upgraded information system are not directly attributable to achieving yk compliance  rather  such costs are a direct result the company s growth 
while these costs are expected to be significant in the aggregate  the most significant portion is being financed through a five year operating lease 
annual lease payments are expected to total approximately million 
costs incurred to date and expected to be incurred with respect to review  testing and remediation of international financial and non financial systems and domestics non financial systems are not anticipated to be significant 
risks of non compliance and contingency plans 
the major applications that pose the greatest threat to the company if the yk compliance program is not successful are the company s financial systems  including project management systems and payroll 
a failure of such systems could result in an inability to determine the status of construction projects or to disburse payroll to the company s workforce on a timely basis or to perform its other financial and accounting functions 
failure of embedded technology could result in the temporary unavailability of equipment and disruption of construction projects 
the primary potential yk risk attributable to third parties would be from a temporary disruption in certain materials and services provided by such third parties 
the goal of the yk project is to ensure that all of the company s critical systems and processes remain functional 
however  because certain systems and processes may be interrelated with systems outside of the control of the company  there can be no assurance that all implementations will be successful 
accordingly  as part of the yk project  contingency and business plans are being developed to respond to any failures as they may occur 
such contingency and business plans are scheduled to be completed by mid year management does not expect the costs to the company of the yk project to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
based on information available at this time  however  the company cannot conclude that any failure of the company or third parties to achieve yk compliance will not adversely affect the company

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
given the company s historically minimal use of these types of instruments  the company does not expect a material impact on its statements from adoption of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company currently does not use any derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about the company s future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments and fair value at august  all instruments described are non trading instruments in millions 
fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate         average interest rate short term debt variable rate    average interest rate foreign currency risks although the majority of the company s transactions are in us dollars  two of the company s subsidiaries conduct some of their operations in various foreign currencies 
the company currently does not use any off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage its risks associated with its operating activities conducted in foreign currencies unless that particular operation enters into a contract in a foreign currency which is different that the local currency of the particular operation 
in limited circumstances and when considered appropriate  the company will utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated purchases and or sales 
the company has historically used these instruments primarily in the manufacturing and selling of certain marine deck equipment 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching its revenues and expenses in the same currency for its contracts 
as of december   the company does not have any outstanding forward exchange contracts
