item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries during the past three years 
the discussion and analysis is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
prior year information has been restated to reflect acquisitions accounted for using the pooling of interests accounting method 
financial institutions acquired by the company during the past three years and accounted for as purchases are reflected in the financial position and results of operations of the company since the date of their acquisition 
this report may contain forward looking statements which are subject to numerous assumptions  risks  and uncertainties 
statements pertaining to future periods are subject to uncertainty because of the possibility of changes in underlying factors and assumptions 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by such forward looking statements for a variety of factors including sharp and or rapid changes in interest rates  significant changes in the economic scenario from the current anticipated scenario which could materially change anticipated credit quality trends and the ability to generate loans  significant delay in or inability to execute strategic initiatives designed to grow revenues and or control expenses  unforeseen business risks related to year computer systems issues  and significant changes in accounting  tax or regulatory practices or requirements 
summary in  the company reported record net income of million  a percent increase over the company s previous high of million in  which represented a percent increase over basic earnings per share for was per share  also a record  compared with per share in and per share in  representing an percent increase in and a percent increase in diluted earnings per share increased to per share in  an percent increase  from per share in diluted earnings per share in increased percent over pretax income for was up million  or percent  over while income tax expense increased percent over the same period reflecting a decrease in the company s effective tax rate from percent in to percent in earning assets average earning assets in increased percent over due principally to a percent increase in average available for sale securities  a percent increase in investment securities  and a percent increase in loans 
these increases were significantly impacted by the company s securitization activity for consisting of the securitization and sale of approximately million of indirect automobile loans in june and the securitization and transfer of approximately million in residential mortgages to available for sale securities in september 
these securitizations resulted in a moderate shift in the average earning asset mix in with loans at percent  investment securities and investment securities available for sale at percent  and other earning assets at percent 
in  loans were percent  investment securities and investment securities available for sale were percent  and other earning assets were percent 
the mix of earning assets is monitored on a continuous basis in order to place the company in a position to react to interest rate movements and to maximize the return on earning assets 
loans average loans increased six percent in with much of the increase concentrated in commercial  financial and agricultural loans  real estate construction loans  and commercial real estate loans 
excluding the impact of securitizations  average loans increased percent in total loans outstanding at year end increased six percent over previous year end levels 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans  which were percent of total loans  increased percent in compared to the previous year 
real estate construction loans increased percent while commercial mortgage loans increased percent from year end to year end residential mortgage and consumer installment loans decreased percent and percent  respectively  compared to levels due to the company s securitization activity 
the percent growth in the company s loan portfolio from to was primarily the result of an increase of percent in commercial  financial and agricultural loans  a percent increase in real estate construction loans  and a percent increase in consumer installment loans 
the company s loan portfolio continues to reflect the diversity of the markets served by the subsidiary banks 
the condition of the economy in states in which the subsidiary banks lend money is further reflected in the loan portfolio mix 
the volume of commercial  financial and agricultural loans  as a percentage of total loans outstanding  increased significantly during continuing the trend of prior years 
residential real estate loans represented percent of the total portfolio at december   down from the percent reported in the prior year 
the loan portfolio table shows the classifications of loans by major category at december   and for each of the preceding four years

the primary objectives of the company s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the company s interest rate position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
the company s investment securities are classified into one of three categories based on management s intent to hold the securities i trading account securities  ii investment securities or iii investment securities available for sale 
securities held in a trading account are required to be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
investment securities designated to be held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
securities classified as available for sale are required to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings and shown separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
for securities classified as held to maturity  the company has the ability  and it is management s intention  to hold such securities to maturity 
management of the maturity of the portfolio is necessary to provide liquidity and control interest rate risk 
maturities of investment securities in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
sales and maturities of investment securities available for sale totaled million and billion  respectively  in while sales and maturities in the portfolio in were million and million 
net gains realized during the year accounted for two percent  four percent and six percent of noninterest income in   and  respectively 
gross unrealized gains in the company s investment securities portfolio at year end totaled million and gross unrealized losses totaled million 
in recent years  the trend of the company has been to invest in taxable securities due to the lack of preferential treatment afforded tax exempt securities under the tax laws 
because of their liquidity  credit quality and yield characteristics  the majority of the purchases of taxable securities have been in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
total average investment securities  including those available for sale  increased percent during after remaining relatively unchanged in  due in part to the securitization and transfer of approximately million in real estate mortgages to securities available for sale in september the following table reflects the carrying amount of the investment securities portfolio at the end of each of the last three years

the amounts and yields disclosed for investment securities available for sale reflect the amortized cost rather than the net carrying value  ie  fair value  of these securities

during a period of rising rates  prepayment speeds generally slow on mbs and cmos with a resulting extension in average life  and vice versa 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
similarly  given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
the weighted average market prices as a percentage of par value for mbs and cmos at december   were percent and percent  respectively 
the market prices for mbs and cmos generally decline in a rising rate environment due to the resulting increase in average life as well as the increased market yield on fixed rate securities and impact of annual and life rate caps on adjustable rate securities 
the opposite is generally true during a period of falling rates 
at december   fixed rate mbs and cmos totaled million and billion  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
adjustable rate mbs and cmos totaled million and million  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
substantially all adjustable rate mbs and cmos are subject to life rate caps  and mbs are also generally subject to a two percent annual cap 
the weighted average life caps at year end were percent and percent for mbs and cmos  respectively  and the corresponding weighted average coupon rates at year end were percent and percent 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the estimated market prices for mbs and cmos would be and  respectively 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the estimated market prices for mbs and cmos would be and  respectively 
trading account securities and other earning assets securities carried in the trading account  while interest bearing  are primarily held for sale to institutional customers for their investment portfolio and generally are sold within thirty days of purchase 
the volume of activity is directly related to general market conditions and reactions to the changing interest rate environment 
the average balance in the trading account securities portfolio for decreased by percent following a percent increase in the following table details the composition of the company s trading account at december   and trading account composition december in thousands us treasury and government us    states and political subdivisions    mortgage backed pass through securities    other debt securities  derivative securities collateralized mortgage obligations    interest rate floors and caps other options average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell decreased percent in compared to a percent decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits in other banks decreased percent during from levels after decreasing percent from to deposits and borrowed funds changes in the company s markets and the economy in general were also reflected in the liability mix during average interest bearing deposits  the primary source of funding for the company  made up percent of total average interest bearing liabilities in  down from percent in and percent in contributing to the overall decrease in the proportion of average interest bearing liabilities represented by average interest bearing deposits relative to was the impact of investment alternatives pursued by customers in response to the low level of interest rates 
in addition  the mix of average interest bearing deposits in and shifted from demand deposits to savings due primarily to a program initiated by the company during under this program  deposit balances in certain now accounts above a certain threshold are transferred to savings accounts  thereby reducing the level of deposit reserves required to be maintained with the federal reserve 
refer to note  regulatory matters and dividends from subsidiaries  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of reserve requirements maintained with the federal reserve 
as a result of this program  during and now account balances averaging million and million  respectively  were transferred to the savings category 
contributing to the change in the mix of interest bearing liabilities in was a percent decrease in average certificates of deposit less than  and other time deposits  offset in part by a percent increase in average certificates of deposit of  or more 
during  average certificates of deposit less than  declined three percent while average certificates of deposit of  or more increased by two percent 
the following table summarizes the maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  maturities of time deposits certificates of deposit other time over deposits over   total in thousands three months or less    over three through six months   over six through twelve months   over twelve months   in order to support earning asset growth of percent in and as a result of consumers choosing investments other than deposits  the company relied more heavily on borrowed funds in continuing a trend that began in borrowed funds consist of federal home loan bank fhlb advances  guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the company s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures capital securities and other short term borrowings  primarily in the form of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
included in other short term borrowings are trading account short sales and the commercial paper of compass bancshares  inc average federal funds purchased increased million  or percent  and the average balance of fhlb and other borrowings  including the capital securities  increased million  or percent  primarily as a result of additional fhlb advances of million  partially offset by repayments of million 
for a discussion of interest rates and maturities of fhlb and other borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  and note  capital securities and preferred stock  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the short term borrowings table below shows the distribution of the company s short term borrowed funds and the weighted average interest rates thereon at the end of each of the last three years

liquidity management involves maintaining the company s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of its customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities they serve 
additionally  the parent holding company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  business combinations  capital injections to its subsidiaries  the servicing of debt and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent holding company is dividends from the subsidiary banks 
at december   the company s subsidiary banks could have paid additional dividends to the parent holding company in the amount of million while continuing to meet the capital requirements for well capitalized banks 
also  the parent holding company has access to various capital markets as evidenced by the issuance of the capital securities during the first quarter of the parent holding company does not anticipate any liquidity requirements in the near future that it will not be able to meet 
asset and liability management functions not only to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the company s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the company can earn a return that meets the investment requirements of its shareholders 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain an acceptable cash position that meets both requirements 
in a banking environment  both assets and liabilities are considered sources of liquidity funding and are monitored on a daily basis 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of investment securities available for sale and trading account securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various customers interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and  basically  represent the company s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
during and  the company has funded the growth in interest earning assets through its increased reliance on borrowed funds as a direct result of consumers choosing investments other than deposits as the general level of interest rates has continued to decline and the stock market has remained strong 
fhlb and other borrowings increased by million in and million in for more information on the composition of the company s long term borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million primarily due to net income 
net cash used in investing activities of billion consisted primarily of net loans originated of billion  available for sale securities purchased of billion  and purchases of investment securities of billion  largely funded by maturities of investment securities of million  proceeds from the sale of securitized indirect automobile loans of million  as well as sales and maturities of investment securities available for sale of million and billion  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities provided the remainder of funding sources for the billion of net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of a net increase of million in fhlb advances and other borrowings  a million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and an increase of billion in deposits offset partially by the payment of million in dividends 
interest rate sensitivity management the company s net interest income  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets at least monthly and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
the estimated impact on the company s net interest income sensitivity over a one year time horizon at december  is shown in the following table along with comparable prior year information 
such analysis assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in interest rates  no balance sheet growth  and the company s estimate of how interest bearing transaction accounts will reprice in each scenario 
percentage increase decrease principal notional in interest income expense amount of earning given immediate and sustained assets  interest parallel interest rate shifts bearing liabilities and down up swaps basis points basis points in thousands december  assets which reprice in one year or less  over one year  liabilities which reprice in one year or less  over one year  non trading swaps  total net interest income sensitivity december  assets which reprice in one year or less  over one year  liabilities which reprice in one year or less  over one year  non trading swaps  total net interest income sensitivity as shown in the table  net interest income sensitivity increased from december   to december  in the down rate scenario  the sensitivity increased due in large part to the decrease in the general level of interest rates during this decrease in interest rates resulted in increased estimated prepayment speeds for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  including cmos 
increased prepayments in a down rate environment result in reinvestment of cash flows at lower rates  thus increasing interest rate sensitivity 
the increase in sensitivity was also a function of the use of less aggressive deposit repricing assumptions in the december  scenario due to the current low interest rate environment 
in the up rate scenario  the slight increase in sensitivity is primarily due to an increase in callable fhlb advances that  in the up rate scenario  are expected to be called requiring replacement of this funding at higher costs 
the alco policy  with which the company complies  is based on the same assumptions as the above table and provides that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not reduce net interest income by more than six percent 
certain financial instruments have been excluded from the above analysis because of the no growth assumption  including letters of credit and commitments to extend credit 
trading account interest rate contracts and options have also been excluded because they have no material impact on net interest income 
the company enters into various interest rate contracts not held in the trading account interest rate protection products to help manage the company s interest sensitivity 
such contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors 
interest rate swaps are contracts where the company typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index  generally the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
interest rate caps and floors purchased or written are contracts where the company receives or pays  respectively  interest if the specified index falls below the floor rate or rises above the cap rate 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the overall interest management strategy and the company s interest risk management program 
the income or expense associated with interest rate swaps  caps and floors is ultimately reflected as an adjustment to interest income or expense 
changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate protection contracts are not reflected in the financial statements until realized 
refer to note  off balance sheet instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements for the composition of the company s interest rate protection contracts as well as a discussion of interest rate risks  credit risks and concentrations in off balance sheet financial instruments 
the net interest amount received or paid on an interest rate protection contract represents an adjustment of the yield or rate on the respective asset or liability with which such contract is associated 
the gain or loss on a terminated interest rate protection contract is deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the original contract as an adjustment of yield or rate on the asset or liability with which the original contract was associated 
at year end  there were no deferred gains and there were  of deferred losses on terminated interest rate protection contracts  which will be recorded as net interest expense through see note  off balance sheet instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding the asset or liability category with which the company s non trading interest protection contracts were associated at december  in addition to interest rate protection contracts used to manage overall interest sensitivity  the company also enters into interest rate contracts for the trading account 
the primary purposes for using interest rate contracts in the trading account are to facilitate customer transactions and to protect cash market positions in the trading account against interest rate movement 
changes in the estimated fair value of contracts in the trading account are recorded in other noninterest income as trading account profits and commissions 
net interest amounts received or paid on interest rate contracts in the trading account are recorded as an adjustment of interest on trading account securities 
see note  off balance sheet instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of interest rate contracts held in the trading account at december  capital resources shareholders equity increased percent in both and exclusive of the change in accumulated other comprehensive income in both and  net income after dividends accounted for substantially all of the increase in shareholders equity 
dividends of million were declared on the company s common stock in  representing a percent increase over the annual dividend rate was per common share  an percent increase over the dividend payout ratio for was percent compared to percent for and percent for the company intends to continue a dividend payout ratio that is competitive in the banking industry while maintaining an adequate level of retained earnings to support continued growth 
on february   the company s board of directors approved a percent increase in the annual dividend rate  raising it to per common share for this marked the eighteenth consecutive year the company has increased its dividend 
a strong capital position  which is vital to the continued profitability of the company  also promotes depositor and investor confidence and provides a solid foundation for the future growth of the organization 
the company has satisfied its capital requirements principally through the retention of earnings 
the company s five year compound growth rate in shareholders equity of percent was achieved primarily through reinvested earnings 
average common shareholders equity as a percentage of total average assets is one measure used to determine capital strength 
overall  the company s capital position remains strong as the ratio of average common shareholders equity to average assets for was percent compared to percent in and percent in as noted above  exclusive of the change in accumulated other comprehensive income  the increase in shareholders equity in and is due almost exclusively to the retention of earnings 
in order to maintain this ratio at appropriate levels with continued growth in total average assets  a corresponding level of capital growth must be achieved 
the table below summarizes these and other key ratios for the company for each of the last three years 
return on equity and assets december return on average assets return on average common equity dividend payout ratio average common shareholders equity to average assets ratio in addition to the capital ratios mentioned above  banking industry regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the company and the subsidiary banks are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off of the balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
tier i capital is defined as common shareholders equity  excluding the net unrealized holding gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  plus perpetual preferred stock and the capital securities  minus goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets 
other disallowed intangibles represent intangible assets  other than goodwill  recorded after february  total qualifying capital is defined as tier i capital plus tier ii capital components  which include such items as qualifying allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
at december   the company s tier i capital and total qualifying capital totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were percent and percent for tier i and total qualifying capital  respectively  at year end  down from percent and percent at year end these ratios are well within the minimum requirements of four percent for tier i capital and eight percent for total qualifying capital 
tier i capital increased by million  or percent  in primarily as a result of earnings retained by the company  net of dividends  while risk adjusted assets increased by billion  or percent 
this significantly greater growth in risk adjusted assets resulted in the decline in percentage ratios from to two other important indicators of capital adequacy in the banking industry are the leverage ratio and the tangible leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is defined as tier i capital divided by total adjusted quarterly average assets 
average quarterly assets are adjusted by subtracting the average unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  period end goodwill and other disallowed intangibles 
the tangible leverage ratio is defined similarly  except  by definition  all other intangible assets not previously excluded are removed from both the numerator and denominator 
the company s leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end while its tangible leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end the following table shows the calculation of capital ratios for the company for the last two years 
capital ratios december in thousands risk based capital tier i capital   tangible tier i capital   total qualifying capital   assets net risk adjusted assets   adjusted quarterly average assets   adjusted tangible quarterly average assets   ratios tier i capital total qualifying capital leverage tangible leverage the regulatory capital ratios of the company s subsidiary banks currently exceed the minimum ratios of percent leverage capital  percent tier i capital and percent total qualifying capital required in for well capitalized banks as defined by federal regulators 
the company continually monitors these ratios to ensure that the subsidiary banks exceed the guidelines

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the principal component of a financial institution s income stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  unless otherwise noted  to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets 
net interest income for increased percent over after increasing percent in over a percent increase in the volume of average earning assets partially offset by a basis point decrease in the net yield was responsible for the increase in the increase in was a function of a percent increase in the volume of earning assets  primarily a percent increase in total loans  coupled with a basis point increase in the net yield 
the schedule on page provides the detail of changes in interest income  interest expense and net interest income due to changes in volumes and rates 
interest income increased percent in as a result of a percent increase in the volume of average earning assets and an basis point decrease in the average interest rate earned 
the decline in the yield on average earning assets was due to decreases in yield in all significant categories of earning assets including a basis point decline in the yield on loans  which was attributable in part to declines in the prime rate  and a basis point decrease in the yield on investment securities 
the decline in the yield on loans was due in part to the company s securitization and sale of million of indirect automobile loans with a weighted average yield to the company of percent in june conversely  the company experienced only a two basis point decline in the yield on investment securities available for sale partly as a result of the company s transfer of million in residential mortgages with a weighted average yield of percent to the investment securities available for sale portfolio in september total interest expense increased by eight percent in due to a nine percent increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities offset partially by a nine basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased by two percent as the result of a three percent increase in the average volume and a seven basis point decrease in rate 
for borrowed funds  which represents interest bearing liabilities that are not classified as deposits  a percent increase in interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings was a result of a percent increase in the average balance coupled with a basis point decline in the rate paid 
similarly  a percent increase in the average balance of federal funds purchased offset by an basis point decrease in the rate paid resulted in a percent increase in interest expense in this category 
from to  interest income increased percent as a result of a percent increase in the volume of average earning assets and a basis point increase in the yield on average earning assets 
interest income on loans rose percent as a result of a percent increase in average volume and a basis point decrease in yield 
interest income on investment securities increased percent from to as a result of a percent increase in average volume and a basis point decrease in the yield 
for securities available for sale  a six percent decrease in the average balance combined with a seven basis point increase in yield resulted in a five percent decrease in interest income 
a basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities combined with a percent increase in average volume resulted in a percent increase in interest expense on interest bearing liabilities in this increase was due to a percent increase in interest expense on federal funds purchased and a percent increase in interest expense on fhlb and other borrowings 
both increases were primarily a function of increases in the average balance of each category of percent and percent  respectively 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased three percent as a result of a four percent increase in average balance and an eight basis point decline in the rate paid 
net interest income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using the net yield and the interest rate spread 
the net yield on earning assets is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average total earning assets 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds 
the net yield decreased basis points to percent in after increasing basis points to percent in the decline in was due to the basis point decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets which was only partially offset by a basis point decline in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the moderate increase in net yield in was a function of the downward repricing of interest bearing deposits and fhlb and other borrowings which outpaced the downward repricing of loans and total investment securities 
this is evidenced by the fact the yield on interest earning assets increased three basis points while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased by one basis point 
during  the net yield on interest earning assets was favorably impacted by the company s use of interest rate contracts  primarily interest rate swaps  increasing the taxable equivalent net yield on interest earning assets by eight basis points 
the greatest impact from the use of interest rate contracts was on the yield and interest income on loans where the net yield was increased by nine basis points and interest income was increased by million 
at the same time  the impact of interest rate contracts on interest bearing liabilities was less significant  decreasing interest expense by less than million 
the impact of the use of interest rate contracts was significantly less in when the positive impact on the net yield on interest earning assets was four basis points 
it is the company s intention to continue to use interest rate contracts to manage its exposure to the changing interest rate environment in the future  although there can be no assurance that the impact of interest rate contracts on the earnings of future periods will be positive 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased nine basis points to percent from the spread of percent 
the increase in was four basis points from percent in see the accompanying table entitled consolidated average balances and rate volume variances for more information 
the following table presents certain interest rates without modification for tax equivalency 
the table on pages and contains these same percentages on a taxable equivalent basis 
tax exempt earning assets continue to make up a smaller percentage of total earning assets 
as a result  the difference between these interest rates with and without modification for tax equivalency continues to narrow

 investment securities available for sale  trading account securities total taxable equivalent adjustment  net interest income  provision for loan losses  net charge offs and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the annual cost of providing an allowance or reserve for estimated losses on loans 
the amount for each year is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
the economic outlook for the states in which the company does business is optimistic in the midst of a stable economy overall 
on a regional basis  however  any economic slowdown in the company s markets could have an effect on most regional bank holding companies and could impact overall asset quality 
such an economic slowdown would probably also have a negative impact on real estate lending as well as the level of net charge offs and delinquencies 
loan review procedures  including loan grading  are constantly utilized by the company s loan review department in order to ensure that potential problem loans are identified early in order to lessen any potentially negative impact such problem loans may have on the company s earnings 
automated loan reports are prepared and used in conjunction with the identification and monitoring of such loans on a monthly basis 
management s involvement continues throughout the process and includes participation in the work out process and recovery activity 
these formalized procedures are monitored internally by the loan review department whose work is supplemented by regulatory agencies that provide an additional level of review on an annual basis 
such internal review procedures are quantified in monthly and quarterly reports to senior management and are used in determining whether such loans represent potential loss to the company 
special reports are prepared for consumer installment loans to identify trends unique to that portfolio 
management monitors the entire loan portfolio  including loans acquired in business combinations  in an effort to identify problem loans so that risks in the portfolio can be identified on a timely basis and an appropriate allowance maintained 
the allowance for loan losses is established by risk group as follows 
large past due loans  classified loans and nonaccrual loans are evaluated individually with specific reserves allocated based on management s review 

smaller nonaccrual and adversely classified loans are assigned a portion of the allowance based on loan grading 
smaller past due loans are assigned a portion of the allowance using a formula that is based on the severity of the delinquency 

the remainder of the portfolio is also allocated a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and the economic conditions for the particular loan portfolio 
allocation weights are assigned based on the company s historical loan loss experience in each loan category  although a higher allocation weight may be used if current conditions indicate that loan losses may exceed historical experience 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is for inherent losses which probably exist as of the valuation date even though they may have not have been identified by the more objective processes used for the allocated portion of the allowance 
this portion of the allowance is particularly subjective and requires judgments based upon qualitative factors which do not lend themselves to exact mathematical calculations 
some of the factors considered are changes in credit concentrations  loan mix  changes in underwriting practices  including the extent of portfolios of acquired institutions  historical loss experience  and the general economic environment in the company s markets 
while the total allowance is described as consisting of an allocated and an unallocated portion  these terms are primarily used to describe a process 
both portions are available to support inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
approximately three percent of the company s loan portfolio represents loans to energy related companies that are dependent on oil and natural gas production as a source of repayment 
the current low level of oil prices has had an adverse impact on this segment of the portfolio 
while management reviews the status and the prospects for this segment of the portfolio on an ongoing basis  the company has specifically allocated reserves for all large credits for which there is concern as to collectibility 
a continued weakness in energy prices is likely to result in a higher level of nonperforming assets for the company 
at december   the allowance for loan losses increased to million from million at year end as a percent of loans  the allowance declined from percent at december  to percent at december  the allowance decreased as a percentage of loans for the following reasons 
the company s nonperforming assets increased because of one million energy credit secured by a combination of proved producing and proved non producing oil reserves that was placed on nonaccrual status during with regard to this loan  the company has established specific reserves that management believes are adequate to absorb the probable loss on the credit 
excluding this loan  nonperforming assets and nonaccrual loans at december   actually decreased from december  
the company s energy loan portfolio and certain segments of the consumer installment portfolio required a greater allocation of the allowance  including a greater allocation for past due loans in these categories 

continued strength in the company s real estate mortgage and commercial real estate portfolios required a smaller allocation of the allowance 

management s favorable experience with the credit quality of the loan portfolios of acquired entities warranted a reduced allowance  particularly in the unallocated portion of the allowance 
because of these factors  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate 
as shown in the following table  net loan charge offs in were million  or percent of average loans  compared with million  or percent of average loans  in and million  or percent of average loans  in the increase in the level of net charge offs in was concentrated in the consumer installment portfolio and commercial  financial and agricultural portfolio continuing the trend from and during  net charge offs of consumer installment loans and commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased by million and million  respectively 
the company s consumer installment portfolio was impacted by the continuing nationwide deterioration in consumer credit quality  as indicated by the increasingly high number of bankruptcies 
net charge offs for the credit card portfolio  which represented only percent of the company s loan portfolio  increased as a percentage of average volume from percent in to percent in similarly  net charge offs as a percentage of loans in the company s indirect consumer installment portfolio  consisting primarily of new and used automobile loans  increased from percent in to percent in the following table sets forth information with respect to the company s loans and the allowance for loan losses for the last five years

when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in nonperforming and past due loans  historical loan loss experience  the existing risk of individual loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries and current and projected economic conditions 
as shown in the following table  management determined that at december   approximately percent of the allowance for loan losses was related to commercial  financial and agricultural loans  percent was associated with real estate loans and percent was related to consumer installment loans 
the portion of the allowance that has not been identified by the company as related to specific loan categories has been allocated to the individual loan categories on a pro rata basis for purposes of the following table

it is the general policy of the company to stop accruing interest income and place the recognition of interest on a cash basis when any commercial  industrial or real estate loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest and the ultimate collection of either is in doubt  unless collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security 
accrual of interest income on consumer loans is suspended when any payment of principal or interest  or both  is more than days delinquent 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income unless the collateral for the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest or a guarantor assures payment of interest 
nonperforming assets at december   were million  an increase of million from year end nonperforming loans increased million from year end to million 
the increase in nonperforming assets in was due in large part to the classification of a million energy related loan as nonaccrual in july as discussed previously  a portion of the company s loan portfolio is energy related and a continued weakness in energy prices is likely to result in a higher level of nonperforming assets for the company

year issues the company initiated a program in to review all of the computer systems of the company and its subsidiaries in order to determine whether the systems were year compliant 
this study not only involved identifying any required modifications or replacements of certain hardware and software maintained by the company  but also receiving assurance from vendors that the appropriate actions have been taken or are being taken by them to remedy their year issues for computer systems that the vendors are responsible for maintaining and that are relied upon by the company 
as a financial institution  the company s compliance has been closely monitored by federal regulatory agencies which have completed two examinations of the company and its year readiness in the past twelve months 
the company is not aware of any existing regulatory restrictions imposed on it by the federal regulatory authorities as a result of the company s current plan and implementation 
as of december   the company has identified its information technology it and non it systems and has completed the assessment phase of each system s year readiness 
it systems within the company include mainframe computer applications  including loan and deposit systems  while non it systems typically include embedded technology  for example  microcontrollers in elevators 
in connection with the identification process  each system was classified as to its importance within the company with systems categorized in one of four categories mission critical  medium priority  low priority or immaterial 
mission critical systems are those identified as vital to a core business activity of the company 
for each it and non it system that was assessed as year compliant  testing was performed to confirm compliance while for each system that was not found to be year compliant  a three step plan involving renovation  validation and implementation was developed to bring the system into compliance 
renovation is comprised of modifying or replacing hardware and software in order to make the system compliant the renovation phase 
validation involves testing the system to determine compliance after modification the validation phase 
implementation entails bringing the compliant system into production the implementation phase 
as of december   percent of the company s mission critical systems were in the renovation phase  percent were in the validation phase  and percent were in the implementation phase 
with regard to all mission critical systems  the company s plan called for the substantial completion of the renovation phase for all systems and the validation phase for in house systems by december  the company s plan also outlines the substantial completion of the validation phase for vendor supported systems by march   and the substantial completion of the implementation phase by june  in addition  the company is also taking appropriate actions to receive assurance that its customers  principally commercial lending customers  are taking necessary steps to address their year issues since noncompliance could adversely effect their ability to repay borrowings to the company 
as of december   the company has evaluated the readiness of a majority of its commercial lending customers as well as a substantial majority of its financial instrument issuers  broker dealer counterparties  and federal funds counterparties 
based on these assessments  management currently believes that there is a low risk of a material detrimental impact on the company s results of operations and financial position because of third party business disruptions or failures related to year events 
the company s assessment of these parties will be ongoing throughout in order to identify any changes in third party readiness that could negatively impact the company 
during and  the company paid million related to year compliance and anticipates additional payments of approximately million 
a substantial portion of these costs have been or will be capitalized in the installation of software and hardware and will be amortized over the life of the related assets 
there has been no material increase in it salaries expense due to year compliance activities as many of the system renovations have coincided with previously planned system replacements or enhancements  the costs of which have been included in the costs disclosed above 
the deferral of certain other it projects in order to assure year readiness has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
while a failure to achieve year compliance with regard to it and non it systems could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition due to inability to perform normal lending  investing and deposit gathering functions  the company believes that its year readiness will be essentially completed by the target date of june   and that any impact of failure to achieve year compliance with any of the company s systems will be immaterial 
the company s contingency plans have concentrated on potential funding needs that may arise if there are disruptions in the company s normal sources of funds as a result of year events  including increased withdrawals by depositors and the inability of corporate customers to maintain their usual levels of deposits because of disruptions in their business caused by year related computer problems 
the plan also addresses the possibility that some of the company s federal funds counterparties may be unable to sell federal funds to the company and that some of its downstream federal funds counterparties may increase borrowing over normal levels 
however  the company s plan does not address funding requirements arising from the systemic failure of the financial system in the united states or globally 
the company s plan also addresses other potential failures by third parties to fully remedy their systems 
this plan will be continually updated as more information becomes available on the year status of the company s funds providers and as funding sources are evaluated and procedures to access those sources are put in place 
other accounting issues in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  fas 
fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
fas will significantly change the accounting treatment of derivative instruments and  depending upon the underlying risk management strategy  these accounting changes could affect future earnings  assets  liabilities  and shareholders equity 
as a result  the company may reconsider its risk management strategies since the new standard would not reflect the results of many of those strategies in the same manner as current accounting practice 
the company is presently evaluating the impact of fas on its computer systems and accounting policies and is also closely monitoring the deliberations of the fasb s derivative implementation task force 
the company will be required to adopt fas on january  presently  the company has not yet quantified the impact that the adoption will have on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
pending acquisitions for information on pending acquisitions  see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  note  business combinations 
impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
various information shown elsewhere in this annual report will assist in the understanding of how well the company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  the summary of net interest income  the maturity distributions  the compositions of the loan and securities portfolios  the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits  and the information related to off balance sheet hedging activities discussed in note  off balance sheet instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered
