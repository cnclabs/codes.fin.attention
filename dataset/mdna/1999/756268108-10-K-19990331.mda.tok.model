comparison of years ended december  and was the most successful sales year in recoton s history 
net sales increased from by million  or  to million 
the record sales performance achieved by recoton in is primarily the result of expanded retail distribution  innovative new product introductions across the company s group of brand names  a strong worldwide distribution system and global market share increases for the company s consumer electronics  video and pc gaming products and mobile accessories and loudspeakers

this increase is attributable to both the inclusion of aamp acquired in november and expanded retail distribution of the company s products 
gross profit in increased million to million and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from in the dollar increase in gross profit was primarily reflective of strong growth in the sales of video game  multimedia and mobile electronic products and the additional sales due to the inclusion of aamp 
the slight decline in the gross profit margin for the year was primarily attributable to sales mix and lower than anticipated sales in home speaker products  resulting in higher factory overhead per unit sold 
in  gross profit for the video and computer game business increased million to million mainly due to the growth in sales of video game and multimedia products  rac business increased million to million primarily due to mobile accessories and speaker sales and the accessories business increased million to million mainly due to the inclusion of aamp 
as a percent of net sales  gross profit for the video game and multimedia products decreased to in from in mainly due to sales mix from the inclusion of pc products sourced by std from outside manufacturers  which sold at a lower margin than products manufactured by std  and competitive pricing pressures due to the mature nature of certain products 
rac s gross margin decreased to in compared to in due mainly to lower than anticipated gross profit margin in the domestic home speaker products 
gross margin on the accessories business increased to in compared to in due primarily to the inclusion of aamp sales for the full year and the transfer of pc product sales to the video and computer game business 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in by million to million  and decreased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the dollar increase was attributable to the variable selling expenses relating to the increased sales volume 
there were also additional expenses for promotional activities and market development 
the percent decrease was attributable to fixed costs being absorbed by the higher sales volume 
as further described in note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company expects to soon reach agreements with the us attorney s office and us customs service to settle all outstanding criminal and civil matters involved in a pending customs investigation 
the company plans to enter guilty pleas to a number of counts involving country of origin mismarking and undervaluation of imports  which will be subject to judicial approval 
the company is presently negotiating the precise terms of written agreements with the government 
while the company is optimistic that this matter will be settled shortly  there can be no assurance that the agreements will be finalized or approved 
the company has recorded million for this global settlement  which together with related fees and costs of approximately million  has been separately reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
the classification of the accrual on the consolidated balance sheet is based on the expected periods of payment  subject to approval by the government 
interest expense net of investment income increased by million to million in the increase was attributable to increased borrowings interest rates were approximately the same to support the inventory buildup required for anticipated record sales in the fourth quarter 
income before income taxes for was million million before the provision for the expected us customs settlement  a increase over the million reported in net income for was million million before the provision for the expected us customs settlement  a decrease over the million in the results of operations for also include a charge of  related to a loan repayment extension in the fourth quarter 
in  income before income taxes  unallocated expenses and the expected us customs settlement was million for the video and computer game business  million for the accessories business and a loss of  for the rac business  which includes a loss before income taxes of the us home audio division of rac of million 
the consolidation of the domestic home audio business under the recoton home audio subsidiary rha and the formation of the recoton mobile electronics division allowed this segment to foster the profitable growth of the car stereo operations  as well as integrate and reposition the home audio business to take advantage of the forthcoming digital age 
new management teams have been put in place  lead by talented industry professionals  and investments are being made in rha 
in recent years  the company s income taxes and effective consolidated income tax rate have been materially affected by changes in the proportion of domestic and foreign earnings 
while earnings from operations in north america and western europe are primarily taxed at or above united states income tax rates  earnings from the company s asian operations are taxed at a current maximum rate of in 
however  the actual tax rate from asian operations is dependent upon the proportion of earnings from mainland china  which have been subject to a tax holiday 
this tax rate is higher in than in because of the expiration of one half of the tax holiday 
recoton s chinese subsidiary  being a production oriented foreign investment enterprise located in a special economic zone in china  was granted a five year tax holiday beginning in this tax holiday allows for full exemption from chinese corporate tax for the and years  and a exemption for the following three years 
the company s pretax income of million is comprised of a combination of foreign earnings and domestic losses 
in addition  since no determination has been made as to what portion of the expected settlement with the us customs service might be deductible for income tax purposes  no deduction has been made for this item in the computation of income taxes for this resulted in a net income tax expense of million or of pretax income in in  the company reported an income tax credit of on pretax income of million  primarily because the tax credits attributable to domestic tax losses were at higher tax rates than the income tax expense attributable to earnings at foreign subsidiaries 
also  in the company reported the benefit of a million nonrecurring tax credit in germany relating to the company s decision to declare dividends from that subsidiary to its us parent 
in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires the company to report components of comprehensive income in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
it includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners 
to date  the company s comprehensive income has been comprised of the company s net income and foreign currency translation adjustments which adjustments were a positive million in and a negative million in included in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
as a result of significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to currencies in western europe for the years ended and  and the related foreign currency translation adjustments recorded by the company  in addition to the changes in net income  comprehensive income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement  effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december   requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that is used internally for evaluating operating performance and deciding how to allocate resources 
the company s reportable operating business segments are described in note p to the notes to consolidated financial statements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires capitalization of costs of software developed or purchased for internal use 
the company elected early adoption of the sop for which resulted in the capitalization of software development costs of approximately  the after tax effect on net income in was approximately  or 
per diluted share 
in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share  which establishes revised standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps 
in accordance with this standard  all prior period eps data was restated 
there was no material change to eps for the year ended december  as a result of the adoption of this standard 
for the year ended december   basic eps was 
share and diluted eps was 
share based on average shares of  basic and  diluted 
in  basic eps for the year was share and diluted eps was share based on average shares of  basic and  diluted 
comparison of years ended december  and net sales in increased from by million or  to million 
the sales increase was primarily attributable to three factors 
the first factor is the inclusion of a full year s sales of the speaker and related product lines of rac acquired in late august the second factor is growth in the video game and multi media product lines 
the video and multi media product lines contributed million to gross sales in as compared to million in the third factor is the acquisitions of heco audio produkte gmbh  a german manufacturer and marketer of home loudspeakers acquired in december  and tambalan limited  an english seller of headphones and other consumer products under the name ross in the united kingdom and to other european and asian markets  acquired in february  and aamp of america  inc  a direct marketer of car audio installation products acquired in november these increases were partially offset by slight declines in sales of certain other accessory product lines 
in  net sales for the video and computer game business increased by million or  to million due mainly to the increase in sales of the video and multi media products  the rac business increased by million to million due to the inclusion of a full year s sales of the speaker and related product lines of rac  acquired in late august the accessories business increased by million or  to million mainly due to the inclusion of sales from aamp of america  inc acquired in november these increases were partially offset by slight declines in sales of certain other accessory product lines 
gross profit in increased million to million and increased as a percentage of net sales to from in the dollar increase resulted from increased sales  of which the rac and video and computer game businesses were the primary contributors 
the increase in gross margin percentage was attributable primarily to a higher margin product mix 
in  gross margin for the video and computer business increased to from in mainly due to a higher margin product mix on video game products 
the rac business increased to from due primarily to certain cost of goods and purchasing synergies 
the accessories business decreased to from in due to the inclusion of pc products which sold at lower gross margin  in such products were sold by the video and computer game business segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in by million to million  and increased as a percentage of net sales from to in the primary portion of the dollar increase was attributable to the inclusion of a full year of the rac operations  acquired in late august  and the other acquisitions 
the percentage increase was attributable to several factors  including increases in bad debt expense as a result of the bankruptcy of three customers and increases in market development expenses 
interest expense increased by million to million in this was primarily attributable to the increased debt associated with the rac acquisition  which was carried for a full year in as compared to four months in in addition  the company incurred debt to finance the growth in sales of the video and computer product lines 
the company s income taxes and effective consolidated income tax rate were affected by changes in the proportion of domestic and foreign earnings and losses 
while earnings from north america and western europe were primarily taxed at or above united states income tax rates  earnings from the company s asian operations were taxed at a maximum rate of 
the actual tax rate from asian operations was dependent on the proportion of earnings from mainland china 
the company s pretax income of million was comprised of a combination of foreign earnings and domestic losses 
this resulted in a net income tax credit of million  primarily because the tax credits attributable to domestic tax losses were at higher tax rates than the income tax expense attributable to earnings at foreign subsidiaries 
also in the company recorded the benefit of a million nonrecurring tax credit in germany relating to the company s decision to declare dividends from that subsidiary to its us parent 
under german law  the german corporate income tax rate can be reduced by approximately when income is distributed instead of being transferred to retained earnings 
recoton s decision to declare stock dividends from its german subsidiary triggered germany s ability to receive a refund of taxes previously paid at the higher corporate tax rate 
this compares to pretax income of million and corresponding income tax expense of million 
as restated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 for basic eps was share and diluted eps was share as compared with basic eps of share and diluted eps of share for outstanding shares in were  basic and  diluted as compared to  basic and  diluted in impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation and changing prices on the company s net sales and revenues and on income from continuing operations in each of the  and fiscal years has been negligible 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  cash flow from operations  borrowings under credit facilities provided by banks in the united states and abroad and proceeds from the sale of the company s securities  including the private placement of the company s notes 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared with million at december  at december   the company had working capital of approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  and to at december  the decreases in working capital and the working capital ratio are primarily the result of the classification of the loans under the company s revolving line of credit  which expires in december  as a current liability at december  at december   these loans were classified as a noncurrent liability as a result of extension in their terms and the elimination of a provision for an annual clean up 
trade receivables increased million to million at december  as compared to december  as a result of the increase in the company s sales volume 
inventories increased from december  levels by million to million at december  the increase in the inventory levels was substantially attributable to the company s video and computer game and mobile electronics product lines 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million to million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to increases in inventories and certain accrued performance bonuses payable in march  which bonuses were classified as noncurrent liabilities at december  the company currently has a multibank credit facility the credit facility  entered into in january and modified several times with the most recent modification occurring on march  as of march  the company has a million revolving credit facility through december   reduced from million  which was in effect on december  the outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving facility were approximately million at december  as compared to million at december  the company also has a million term loan  repayable in quarterly installments with the last installment due in may million balance as of december

the pricing of the additional warrants would be based on market values for the company s common shares at that time 
at december  and at various times prior to such date  the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under the notes and the credit facility 
at such times both the note holders and bank lenders either amended the covenants or waived the company s non compliance with such covenants 
at december   the company was in compliance with the amended covenants under the notes and the credit facility

to date there has been limited exposure to loss due to foreign currency risks in the company s asian subsidiaries  because the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the us dollar at an official exchange rate of hk to us 
additionally  in recent years there have been no material fluctuations in the hong kong chinese exchange rates 
also  the company maintains the majority of its currency in asia in us dollar accounts 
however  as a result of on going turmoil in the asian currency markets  there can be no assurance that these relationships will continue 
the company s operations  which are currently being transacted on a global basis  are exposed to variations in foreign exchange rates 
the company s shareholders equity was increased by a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company s shareholders equity was reduced by a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately million  of which approximately million occurred in the first quarter of the changes in the exchange rates of the german and italian currencies  which were the principal causes of the foreign translation adjustment  had no material impact on the company s results of operations 
if there are any material adverse changes in the relationships between the european and or canadian currencies with the united states dollar or if the hong kong or chinese currencies should no longer be tied to the us dollar  such changes could adversely affect the results of the company s european  canadian and or asian operations included in the consolidated financial statements and could cause further increases in the amount of foreign currency translation adjustments which are charged directly to shareholder s equity 
the company has leased expanded facilities for sales and warehousing in germany and the uk and is considering enlarging its manufacturing facilities in mainland china 
in addition the company is considering the acquisition of additional computer hardware and software to be used both in the united states and in its foreign locations 
the company will also continue to evaluate possible acquisitions that may be attractive to the growth of the company 
year the company is in the process of analyzing and addressing what is known as the year or yk issue 
based on current information  the company believes that it will be year compliant in a timely manner and the cost of achieving such compliance will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
as noted in the following discussion  however  there are multiple variables in determining whether full yk compliance can be achieved  many of which are dependent on efforts of third parties 
background this issue has arisen because many existing computer programs use only two digits instead of four eg  instead of to identify a year in the date field 
this is a holdover from the days when businesses first started using computers and electronic memory was limited and storage was expensive 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
accordingly  some computers can not determine if the reference to the year means or the failure of such applications or systems to properly recognize the dates beginning in the year could result in miscalculations or even system failures 
the company  through a team including its vice president information systems and its vice president compliance  is assessing its yk compliance situation 
internal systems the company s vice president information systems has the responsibility to have the company s entire computer and computer dependent systems tested and  if necessary  modified or replaced to ensure yk compliance 
based on its analysis to date  including tests run on the company s backup computer system and analysis of the in place systems  the company believes that all of its domestic and substantially all of its foreign internal computer systems hardware  system software and applications software and computer dependent systems  including technology embedded in the company s machinery and other equipment to the extent that it is date sensitive  are currently yk compliant and that the foreign operations which are not currently compliant will  through the replacement or modification of existing hardware and software  be made compliant in a timely manner 
this process was completed in the first quarter of the company has not retained any outside service provider to conduct independent verification of the company s compliance status and does not at this time intend to hire any such service provider 
the company is currently in the process of contacting its key vendors and service providers  as well as key customers  to ascertain their yk compliance to the extent that their problems could affect the company s internal systems or other aspects of the company s business 
inquiry letters have been sent to all key united states vendors  service providers and customers and the company is in the process of sending similar letters to most key foreign vendors  service providers and customers 
returns from such persons are being received 
the company has not yet determined when it will have that process completed 
the company at this time cannot make any prediction as to the degree of compliance by such vendors and service providers or the consequence to the company of any noncompliance 
any serious yk problems which significant vendors and service providers encounter could materially adversely impact the company 
if significant customers especially those which are ordering from the company electronically have yk problems  that also could materially adversely impact the company by seriously impacting the level of their purchases from the company until such problems are resolved 
while the company believes that the efforts which it has taken and plans to take should be sufficient to identify and correct any yk problems before december   there can be no assurance that the company will be fully yk compliant in a timely manner 
financial ramifications the expenses incurred to date to achieve year compliance have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
based on the company s current status of internal yk compliance review and other preliminary information  the company does not anticipate that any expenses yet to be incurred to achieve year compliance will have any material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition or that its business will be adversely affected by the yk issue in any material respect 
the company preliminarily estimates that the costs of achieving yk compliance  including costs of personnel devoting significant effort on yk matters  will be immaterial 
the costs associated with any new computers or computer programs  which are year compliant  have been and will be capitalized and amortized over the computer s and or software s expected useful life 
any system modifications or maintenance costs necessary to make the company s existing computer programs yk compliant have been and will be expensed as incurred 
achieving yk compliance  however  is dependent on multiple factors  many of which are not within the company s sole control 
accordingly  should one or more of the internal systems of the company or key customers or key vendors exhibit significant yk problems  the company s business and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
no information technology projects have been deferred due to yk efforts 
risks until it has completed its yk assessment  and attempted to fix any problems which such assessment may disclose  the company can not be in a position to determine what would be its most reasonably likely worst case yk scenario or any plan for handling such scenario 
the company has not devised any back up plans should it suffer any internal yk problems or should any of its vendors or customers yk problems affect the company 
after completion of its yk assessment  including review of queries sent to such vendors and customers  the company will assess the need for any contingency plans 
the failure to correct a material yk problem could result in an interruption of  or inability to perform on a timely fashion  a necessary business activity or operation 
such failures could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
because of the general uncertainty which companies face regarding the year issue  in part due to the fact that actions of third parties could affect the company s compliance  it is not possible to determine at this time whether any actual failures will have any material adverse impact on the company 
implications to the company from the adoption of a european common currency the company has extensive operations in certain european countries  including germany  italy and the united kingdom 
it also sells to additional countries in europe 
for the most recently competed fiscal year  approximately of the company s net sales were in europe 
with the exception of the united kingdom  all of the countries in which the company has operations have confirmed their participation in a new country european common currency  the euro 
the adoption of such common currency is being phased in over a three year period  which started in january during such phase in period  both the euro and the historical currency of a country will be valid  although new euro denominated currency will not be issued until each member country will decide when its legacy currency will cease to be legal tender  which will occur during the period january through june  until the introduction of euro denominated currency  the paying party will have the option to decide whether to pay in the legacy currency or in euro converted to the legacy currency 
among other possible economic implications  it is expected that the adoption of such common currency will lead to greater price transparency and thereby increased competition within such common currency zone 
for instance  with a single currency applicable to the entire region  consumers may be able to more easily discern any material price differences for the company s products between different countries and modify their buying practices accordingly 
this may require adjustments in the company s marketing and pricing strategies 
whether any such price differentials will lead to significant changes in purchasing practices by the company s customers depends on factors such as convenience and language related matters as well as other factors which may determine where a consumer will purchase products 
the company is not able at this time to gauge whether the likelihood of increased competition arising from the introduction of the euro would have any significant long term adverse impact on the pricing for the company s products 
the adoption of a common currency may require a significant modification to the company s accounting systems 
among other things  it will be necessary to operate in each country with dual currencies until the three year phase in period has passed 
management believes  however  that any necessary changes can be rapidly and inexpensively implemented using off the shelf systems if the company s internal systems are not sufficient
