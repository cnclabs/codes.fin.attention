prior year disclosures have been presented to conform to the requirements of sfas no 
information systems and year readiness some computers  software  and other equipment include computer code in which the calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result  some of these systems will not operate correctly after because they may interpret to mean  rather than these problems are widely expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year approaches  and are commonly referred to as the year problem 
the company believes that is has identified all significant data  computer hardware  software applications and related equipment  as well as office and facilities equipment such as telephone switches and security systems used in connection with its internal operations that must be modified  upgraded or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to its business 
the company is currently in the process of modifying  upgrading and replacing major systems that have been assessed as adversely affected  and expects to complete this process before the occurrence of any material disruption of its business 
however  there can be no assurance in this regard 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required modifications and test year compliance 
the company estimates that its compliance activities will be completed no later than the first quarter of for all mission critical items and no later than the third quarter of for all medium and low risk items and estimates that the total costs of this effort will be million for the five year period ending june  total costs incurred through year end are approximately million 
the year problem also affects some of the company s vendors and suppliers of data  computers  software and other equipment 
the company has been actively contacting all vendors and suppliers to inquire about their year readiness 
however  the company has limited or no control over the actions of these vendors and suppliers 
accordingly  the company cannot guarantee that these vendors and suppliers will resolve any or all year problems 
if the company s vendors and suppliers fail to resolve year problems  the company s business could be materially disrupted 
the company expects to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially adversely affect its business operations 
however  due to the number of interactions with internal and external systems  equipment and data  management believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting the company or its clients have been identified or corrected 
in addition  no one can accurately predict how many year problem related failures will occur or the severity  duration or financial consequences of these potential failures 
as a result  management expects that the company could suffer a small number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for the company and its clients that will divert some of management s time and attention and financial and human resources from its ordinary business activities 
the company is developing contingency plans to minimize the impact of potential year problems on its mission critical systems 
the company expects to complete its contingency plans by the end of third quarter the discussion of the company s efforts  and management s expectations  relating to year compliance constitutes forward looking statements 
the company s ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  vendor ability to modify proprietary software and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review 
seasonability and inflation the company does not believe its operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on operations
