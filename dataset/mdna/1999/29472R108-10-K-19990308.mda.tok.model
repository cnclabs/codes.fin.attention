year the year issue year is the result of computer programs and embedded processors systems failing to properly account for the end of and the rollover to the year the year issue comes from three date related problems and practices

as a result  programs and equipment that have time sensitive functions may interpret a date using as being rather than second  the year is a leap year 
there is a possibility that some systems may fail to account for the leap day properly 
third  in practice  an artificial date of is sometimes used as a fictitious date when testing systems 
it is possible that some systems will reject the actual date of september  as fictitious 
problems arising from one or more of these problems and practices could result in failure of one or more systems causing a disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  collect rents  or engage in similar normal business activities
