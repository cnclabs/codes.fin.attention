income from the disposition of client warrants totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company has historically obtained rights to acquire stock in the form of warrants in certain clients as part of negotiated credit facilities 
the receipt of warrants does not change the loan covenants or other collateral control techniques employed by the company to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming  and collateral requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements where warrants are not obtained 
the timing and amount of income from the disposition of client warrants typically depends upon factors beyond the control of the company  including the general condition of the public equity markets as well as the merger and acquisition environment 
therefore income from the disposition of client warrants cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy and is likely to vary materially from period to period 
during the years ended december   and  a significant portion of the income from the disposition of client warrants was offset by expenses related to the company s efforts to build an infrastructure sufficient to support present and prospective business activities  and was also offset by increases to the provision for loan losses during those years

the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of noninterest expense  excluding costs associated with other real estate owned  by adjusted revenues  defined as the total of net interest income and noninterest income  excluding income from the disposition of client warrants and gains or losses related to sales of investment securities

investment securities the following table details the composition of investment securities  all of which were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  at december   and december  dollars in thousands us treasury us    us agencies and corporations discount notes and bonds    mortgage backed securities    collateralized mortgage obligations    obligations of states and political subdivisions    commercial paper    bankers acceptances  other debt securities    other equity securities    total    investment securities totaled billion at december  this represented a million  or  increase over the december  balance of billion 
this increase resulted from excess funds that were generated by strong growth in the company s deposits outpacing the growth in loans during  and primarily consisted of us agency securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and municipal securities 
the significant increase in municipal securities was composed of both taxable and non taxable municipal obligations  and was largely attributable to the company obtaining slightly higher yields on these investments as compared to us agency discount notes and bonds and other short term securities

this risk  known as prepayment risk  may cause the mbs and the cmo to remain outstanding for a period of time different than that assumed at the time of purchase 
when interest rates decline  prepayments generally tend to increase  causing the average expected remaining maturity of the mbs and the cmo to decline 
conversely  if interest rates rise  prepayments tend to decrease  lengthening the average expected remaining maturity of the mbs and the cmo 
loans the composition of the loan portfolio  net of unearned income  for each of the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands commercial      real estate construction      real estate term      consumer and other      total loans      total loans at december   net of unearned income  were billion  representing a million  or  increase compared to the billion outstanding at december  the increase in loans from the year end total was widely distributed throughout the loan portfolio  as evidenced by increased loan balances in all of the company s market niches  specialized lending products and loan offices 
in december  the company announced that the bank had discontinued new loan originations associated with its religious financial resources rfr division 
started in  the bank had approximately million in outstanding loans to religious organizations  predominantly for construction of buildings for worship and education  as of december  competitive changes within the religious organizations market affected the bank s ability to generate its anticipated loan yield and provide returns that exceed the company s required return on capital 
the credit quality of the rfr portfolio was not a factor in the company s decision to discontinue new rfr loan origination 
since inception  the company has not incurred any losses associated with the rfr portfolio 
the discontinuation of new rfr loan origination could have an effect on the future loan growth of the company 
the following table sets forth the remaining contractual maturity distribution of the company s loans reported on a gross basis at december  for fixed and variable rate commercial and real estate construction loans december  after one year and one year through after or less five years five years total dollars in thousands fixed rate loans commercial     real estate construction   total fixed rate loans     variable rate loans commercial     real estate construction    total variable rate loans     upon maturity  loans satisfying the company s credit quality standards may be eligible for renewal 
such renewals are subject to the normal underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans 
the company does not grant loans with unconditional extension terms 
a substantial percentage of the company s loans are commercial in nature  and such loans are generally made to emerging growth and middle market companies in a variety of industries 
as of december   only one industry sector as identified by standard industrial codes represented more than of the company s loan portfolio 
the religious financial resources division  in which new loan originations were discontinued in december  represented of the company s total loan portfolio as of december  management of the company has continued to evaluate both the economic events occurring in asia during and the forecasts for the us economy for  in an effort to determine the impact on the markets the company serves 
now a full year after commencement of the asian economic crisis  the company has determined it has no direct exposure to the crisis 
only one borrowing client has been critically affected by the asian economic crisis and that asset has been written down to reflect the perceived exposure 
the outlook for the us economy in is uncertain and although no significant current or forecasted negative impact has been identified with respect to the company s loan growth  credit quality  overall financial condition  and results of operations  management has decided to bolster the allowance for loan losses 
future events and circumstances surrounding the economic conditions in the us and asia cannot be predicted  nor can the impact of these future events and circumstances on the company s loan growth  credit quality  overall financial condition  and results of operations be determined at the present time 
general conditions in the public equity markets  in particular those related to public stock offerings  as well as the merger and acquisitions environment  may have an impact on the bank 
one consequence of an active market for public stock offerings and mergers and acquisitions is the payoff or reduction of a portion of the bank s loans by some of its clients which complete public stock offerings  or merge with  or are acquired by  another company 
such a reduction in outstanding loans  if significant  could adversely affect the company s consolidated earnings 
loan administration authority over the company s loan policies resides with the company s board of directors 
this authority is managed through the approval and periodic review of the company s loan policies 
the board of directors delegates authority to the directors loan committee to supervise the loan underwriting  approval and monitoring activities of the company 
the directors loan committee consists of outside board of directors members and the company s chief executive officer  who serves as an alternate 
under the oversight of the directors loan committee  lending authority is delegated to the chief credit officer and the company s internal loan committee consisting of the chief credit officer  certain managers and loan administrators 
requests for new and existing credits which meet certain size and underwriting criteria may be approved outside of the company s internal loan committee by designated senior lenders or jointly with a loan administrator 
credit quality and the allowance for loan losses credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
while the bank follows underwriting and credit monitoring procedures which it believes are appropriate in growing and managing the loan portfolio  in the event of nonperformance by these other parties  the bank s potential exposure to credit losses could significantly affect the company s consolidated financial position and earnings 
lending money involves an inherent risk of nonpayment 
through the administration of loan policies and monitoring of the loan portfolio  management seeks to reduce such risks 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate to provide a financial buffer for losses  both identified and unidentified  in the loan portfolio 
management regularly reviews and monitors the loan portfolio to determine the risk profile of each credit  and to identify credits whose risk profiles have changed 
this review includes  but is not limited to  such factors as payment status  the financial condition of the borrower  borrower compliance with loan covenants  underlying collateral values  potential loan concentrations  and general economic conditions 
potential problem credits are identified and  based upon known information  action plans are developed 
management has established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this process attempts to assess the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by segregating the allowance for loan losses into three components specific  loss migration  and general 
the specific component is established by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses to individual classified credits on the basis of specific circumstances and assessments 
the loss migration component is calculated as a function of the historical loss migration experience of the internal loan credit risk rating categories 
the general component is an unallocated portion that supplements the first two components and includes management s judgment of the effect of current and forecasted economic conditions on the borrowers abilities to repay  an evaluation of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the size of the overall loan portfolio  an evaluation of the composition of  and growth trends within  the loan portfolio  consideration of the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  net charge off trends  and other factors 
while this evaluation process utilizes historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses  relies  to a great extent  on the judgment and experience of management 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands balance at january       charge offs commercial      real estate consumer and other total charge offs      recoveries commercial      real estate  consumer and other total recoveries      net charge offs recoveries     provision for loan losses      balance at december       net charge offs recoveries to average total loans the following table displays the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among specific classes of loans december  percent percent percent of total of total of total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount dollars in thousands commercial     real estate term real estate construction consumer and other unallocated  n a  n a  n a  total     percent percent of total of total loans amount loans commercial  real estate term real estate construction consumer and other unallocated n a  n a total  the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  compared to million at december  this increase was due to million in additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses  offset by net charge offs of million during the net charge off amount was composed of million in gross charge offs and million in gross recoveries 
the gross charge off total included million and million in charge offs that were incurred during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
gross charge offs for the third quarter of  the largest of which was million  were primarily related to five commercial credits and were not concentrated in any particular niche or industry 
of the total third quarter gross charge offs  million were classified as nonperforming loans at the end of  while million were disclosed in the company s second quarter q as having a higher than normal risk of becoming nonperforming loans during the third quarter of the company incurred million in gross charge offs during the fourth quarter of  primarily centered in the company s quickstart and bridge portfolios 
gross charge offs in the fourth quarter of included three bridge loans and four quickstart loans totaling million and million  respectively 
the company s quickstart product is based in large part on an analysis that indicates that almost all venture capital backed clients that receive a first round of equity infusion from a venture capitalist will receive a second round 
the analysis indicated that the second round typically occurred months after the first round 
hence  proceeds from the second round could be used to pay off the month term loan offered under the quickstart product 
however  the second round has been occurring much sooner than expected and the additional cash infusion has occasionally been depleted before months 
the likelihood of a third round occurring is not as great as a second round and thus this has resulted in higher than anticipated charge offs related to this product during the fourth quarter of the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses as of december  increased million  or  from the prior year end 
this increase reflects management s decision to further bolster the allowance for loan losses and maintain strong coverage ratios based on the economic uncertainty surrounding many of the company s markets in and the higher than normal charge offs experienced during the third and fourth quarters of gross charge offs for were million  and included charge offs totaling million related to two commercial credits  one in the bank s technology and life sciences niche and the other in one of the bank s special industry niches 
gross recoveries of million in included million related to a commercial credit in one of the bank s special industry niches that was partially charged off in gross charge offs for were million  and primarily resulted from five credits  none of which were related to the bank s technology and life sciences niche 
gross recoveries of million in included million related to one commercial credit that was partially charged off in net loan recoveries in of million included million in recoveries from a real estate client relationship that had been charged off in and million in recoveries related to a commercial credit that was partially charged off in net loan charge offs of million in included the partial charge off of loans to two commercial borrowers totaling million 
in general  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  however  future changes in circumstances  economic conditions or other factors could cause management to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses as deemed necessary 
nonperforming assets consist of loans that are past due days or more which are still accruing interest  loans on nonaccrual status and oreo and other foreclosed assets 
the table below sets forth certain relationships between nonperforming loans  nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses

 in substance foreclosure loans have been reclassified from oreo to nonaccrual loans 
the reclassified amount is  at december  the detailed composition of nonaccrual loans is presented in the following table 
there were no real estate construction or term loans on nonaccrual status at december  and december  dollars in thousands commercial   consumer and other total nonaccrual loans   nonperforming loans totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the million total at december  of the total nonperforming loans at year end  million were charged off  million were placed on performing status and million were repaid during additionally  million in loans were placed on nonperforming status during and still classified as nonperforming loans at the end of nonperforming loans at december  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from the million total at december   as a million net increase in nonaccrual loans during was largely offset by the payoff during the first quarter of of one credit in excess of million that was more than days past due  and still accruing interest  as of december  the increase in nonaccrual loans at december   from the prior year end  was primarily due to two commercial credits totaling approximately million which were placed on nonaccrual status during the last half of  one of which was returned to performing status in the first quarter of and the other was partially charged off in  with the remaining balance still in nonperforming 
nonperforming loans at december  included the aforementioned credit in excess of million that was more than days past due  and still accruing interest  as of december  the export import bank of the us ex im provided the bank with a guarantee of this credit facility  and the bank received the guarantee payment related to this credit from the ex im in the first quarter of the million increase in nonperforming loans at december   compared to year end  was concentrated in two commercial credits  both of which were paid off during and in addition to the loans disclosed in the foregoing analysis  management has identified three loans with principal amounts aggregating approximately million  that  on the basis of information known by management  were judged to have a higher than normal risk of becoming nonperforming 
the company is not aware of any other loans where known information about possible problems of the borrower casts serious doubts about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
oreo and other foreclosed assets totaled a combined million and million at december  and  respectively 
the oreo and other foreclosed assets balance at december  consisted of one oreo property and one other asset which was acquired through foreclosure 
the oreo property consists of multiple undeveloped lots and was acquired by the company prior to june the one other asset acquired through foreclosure  which totaled million at december   consists of a favorable leasehold right under a master lease which the company acquired upon foreclosure of a loan during deposits the company s deposits are largely obtained from companies within the technology and life sciences niche  and  to a lesser extent  from businesses within the company s special industry niches and from individuals served by the company s executive banking division 
the company does not obtain deposits from conventional retail sources and does not accept brokered deposits 
the following table presents the composition of the company s deposits for the last five years december  dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand      now      regular money market      bonus money market      time      total deposits      total deposits were billion at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end total of billion 
a significant portion of the increase in deposits during was concentrated in the company s highest rate paying deposit product  its bonus money market deposit product  which increased million  or  and in the company s noninterest bearing demand deposits  which increased million  or  from the prior year end 
increased balances during in most of the company s deposit products were explained by high levels of client liquidity attributable to a strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community  and by growth during in the number of clients served by the company 
the aggregate amount of time deposit accounts individually exceeding  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   all time deposit accounts exceeding  were scheduled to mature within one year 
no material portion of the company s deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect the business of the company 
year readiness disclosure the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec  an oversight authority for financial institutions  has issued several interagency statements on year project awareness 
these statements require financial institutions to  among other things  examine the year implications of their reliance on vendors  determine the potential impact of the year issue on their customers  suppliers and borrowers  and to survey its exposure  measure its risk and prepare a plan to address the year issue 
in addition  federal banking regulators have issued safety and soundness guidelines to be followed by financial institutions to assure resolution of any year problems 
the federal banking agencies have asserted that year testing and certification is a key safety and soundness issue in conjunction with regulatory examinations  and the failure to appropriately address the year issue could result in supervisory action  including the reduction of the institution s supervisory ratings  the denial of applications for mergers or acquisitions  or the imposition of civil monetary penalties 
the company  following an initial awareness phase  is utilizing a three phase plan for achieving year readiness 
the assessment phase was intended to determine which computers  operating systems and applications require remediation and prioritizing those remediation efforts by identifying mission critical systems 
the assessment phase has been completed except for the on going assessment of new systems 
the remediation and testing phase addressed the correction or replacement of any non compliant hardware and software related to the mission critical systems and testing of those systems 
since most of the bank s information technology systems are off the shelf software  remediation efforts have focused on obtaining year compliant application upgrades 
the bank s core banking system  which runs loans  deposits and the general ledger  has been upgraded to the year compliant version and has been forward date tested and year certified by the bank 
the year releases for all of the bank s other internal mission critical systems have also been received  forward date tested and certified 
the next step of this phase  testing mission critical service providers  is anticipated to be substantially completed by march  during the final phase  the implementation phase  remediated and validated code will be tested in interfaces with customers  business partners  government institutions  and others 
it is anticipated that the implementation phase will be substantially completed by june  the company may be impacted by the year compliance issues of governmental agencies  businesses and other entities who provide data to  or receive data from  the company  and by entities  such as borrowers  vendors  customers  and business partners  whose financial condition or operational capability is significant to the company 
therefore  the company s year project also includes assessing the year readiness of certain customers  borrowers  vendors  business partners  counterparties  and governmental entities 
in addition to assessing the readiness of these external parties  the company is developing contingency plans which will include plans to recover operations and alternatives to mitigate the effects of counterparties whose own failure to properly address year issues may adversely impact the company s ability to perform certain functions 
these contingency plans are currently being developed and are expected to be substantially completed by june  if year issues are not adequately addressed by the company and significant third parties  the company s business  results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
failure of certain vendors to be year compliant could result in disruption of important services upon which the company depends  including  but not limited to  such services as telecommunications  electrical power and data processing 
failure of the company s loan customers to properly prepare for the year could also result in increases in problem loans and credit losses in future years 
it is not  however  possible to quantify the potential impact of any such losses at this time 
notwithstanding the company s efforts  there can be no assurance that the company or significant third party vendors or other significant third parties will adequately address their year issues 
the company is continuing to assess the year readiness of third parties but does not know at this time whether the failure of third parties to be year compliant will have a material effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company currently estimates that its total cost for the year project will approximate million 
during  the company incurred million in charges related to its year remediation effort and expects to incur million in charges include the cost of external consulting and the cost of accelerated replacement of hardware  but do not include the cost of internal staff redeployed to the year project 
the company does not believe that the redeployment of internal staff will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
the foregoing paragraphs contain a number of forward looking statements 
these statements reflect management s best current estimates  which were based on numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  representations received from third party service providers and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates  including year costs  will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
a number of important factors could cause management s estimates and the impact of the year issue to differ materially from what is described in the forward looking statements contained in the above paragraphs 
those factors include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of programmers and other systems personnel  inaccurate or incomplete execution of the phases  results of year testing  adequate resolution of year issues by the company s customers  vendors  competitors  and counterparties  and similar uncertainties 
the forward looking statements made in the foregoing year discussion speak only as of the date on which such statements are made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
interest rate risk management a key objective of asset liability management is to manage interest rate risk associated with changing asset and liability cash flows and market interest rate movements 
interest rate risk occurs when interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not reprice simultaneously and in equal volumes 
the asset liability committee of the bank alco provides oversight to the company s interest rate risk management process and recommends policy guidelines regarding exposure to interest rates for approval by the board of directors 
adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis  and decisions related to the management of interest rate exposure are made when appropriate and agreed to by the alco 
the company manages interest rate risk principally through strategies involving its investment securities portfolio  including adjusting both the maturity structure of the portfolio and the amount of interest rate sensitive securities 
company policies also permit the limited use of off balance sheet derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk 
at december   the company held one such off balance sheet derivative transaction in the form of an interest rate swap for a notional principal amount of million to mature on november  this transaction was entered into as part of the company s normal interest rate risk management process 
see item financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements financial instruments with off balance sheet risk for additional related discussion 
the company s monitoring activities related to managing interest rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and the use of a simulation model 
while traditional gap analysis provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet  it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time 
accordingly  the company combines the use of gap analysis with use of a simulation model which provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to reprice within a specific time period and the amount of funding sources anticipated to reprice within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of funding sources repricing within that same time period 
positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates rise 
negative cumulative gaps suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall 
company policy guidelines provide that the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets should not exceed 
the gap analysis as of december  indicates that the company was positioned within these guidelines as the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets was 
the following table illustrates the company s interest rate sensitivity gap positions at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  assets and liabilities which mature or reprice after after after after day to month to months to months year to after immediately month months months to year years years dollars in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell  investment securities ustreasury and agencies obligations      collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities       obligations of states and political subdivisions       commercial paper and other debt securities     other equity securities total investment securities       loans         total interest earning assets        funding sources money market and now deposits  time deposits     total interest bearing deposits     trust preferred securities  portion of noninterest bearing funding sources total funding sources      off balance sheet items interest rate swap   gap        cumulative gap        not stated total interest earning assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell  investment securities ustreasury and agencies obligations  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities  obligations of states and political subdivisions  commercial paper and other debt securities  other equity securities   total investment securities   loans    total interest earning assets   funding sources money market and now deposits  time deposits  total interest bearing deposits  trust preferred securities  portion of noninterest bearing funding sources   total funding sources   off balance sheet items interest rate swap gap  cumulative gap includes interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions of as of december  principal cash flows are based on estimated principal payments as of december  not stated column consists of equity securities  tax credit funds  venture capital investments  and federal reserve bank stock as of december  not stated column consists of nonaccrual loans of  and overdrafts of  offset by unearned income of  as of december  maturity repricing columns for fixed rate loans are based upon the amount and timing of related principal payments as of december  one application of the aforementioned simulation model involves measurement of the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of estimated cash flows from the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items  defined as the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe 
this analysis assesses the changes in market values of interest rate sensitive financial instruments which would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  and the resulting effect on the company s mvpe 
policy guidelines establish maximum variances in the company s mvpe of and in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  respectively 
at december   the company s mvpe exposure related to the aforementioned changes in market interest rates was within policy guidelines 
the following table presents the company s mvpe exposure at december  and december  related to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  respectively 
change in interest estimated increase rates basis points decrease in mvpe estimated dollars in thousands mvpe amount percent december  december  the preceding table indicates that in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase in market interest rates  the company s mvpe would be expected to decrease  and that in the event of an instantaneous and sustained decrease in market interest rates  the company s mvpe would be expected to increase 
the market value calculations supporting the results in the preceding table are based on the present value of estimated cash flows utilizing both market interest rates provided by independent broker dealers and other publicly available sources which the company deems reliable 
these calculations do not contemplate any changes which the alco could make to reduce the company s mvpe exposure in response to a change in market interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table 
for example  although certain of the company s assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the interest rates on certain of the company s asset and liability categories may precede  or lag behind  changes in market interest rates 
also  the actual rates of prepayments on loans and investments could vary significantly from the assumptions utilized in deriving the results as presented in the preceding table 
further  a change in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve could result in different mvpe estimations from those presented herein 
accordingly  the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
additionally  the resulting mvpe estimates are not intended to represent  and should not be construed to represent  the underlying value of the company 
the simulation model also provides the alco with the ability to simulate the company s net interest income using either one interest rate forecast simple simulation or a forecast of multiple interest rate scenarios stochastic simulation 
in order to measure  as of december   the sensitivity of the company s forecasted net interest income to changing interest rates  utilizing the simple simulation methodology  both a rising and falling interest rate scenario were projected and compared to a base market interest rate forecast derived from the treasury yield curve 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased or decreased  as applicable  by basis points in equal increments over a one year period 
company policy guidelines provide that the difference between a base market interest rate forecast scenario over the succeeding one year period compared with the aforementioned rising and falling interest rate scenarios over the same time period should not result in net interest income sensitivity exceeding 
simulations as of december  indicated that the company was well within these policy guidelines 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk impacting the company 
other types of market risk affecting the company in the normal course of its business activities include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk 
the impact on the company  resulting from these latter two market risks  is deemed immaterial and no separate quantitative information concerning market rate and price exposure is presented herein 
the company does not maintain a portfolio of trading securities and does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
liquidity another important objective of asset liability management is to manage liquidity 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet loan demand and depositors needs  and to service other liabilities as they come due  without causing an undue amount of cost or risk  and without causing a disruption to normal operating conditions 
the company regularly assesses the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns  present and forecasted market and economic conditions  individual client funding needs  and existing and planned company business activities 
the alco provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines  subject to board of directors approval  and courses of action to address the company s actual and projected liquidity needs 
the ability to attract a stable  low cost base of deposits is the company s primary source of liquidity 
other sources of liquidity available to the company include short term borrowings  which consist of federal funds purchased  security repurchase agreements and other short term borrowing arrangements 
the company s liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of its portfolio of liquid assets 
liquid assets  as defined by the company  include cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations  federal funds sold  securities purchased under resale agreements  investment securities maturing within six months  investment securities eligible and available for pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of six months  and anticipated near term cash flows from investments 
bank policy guidelines provide that liquid assets as a percentage of total deposits should not fall below 
at december   the bank s ratio of liquid assets to total deposits was 
this ratio is well in excess of the bank s minimum policy guidelines and is slightly higher than the comparable ratio of as of december  in addition to monitoring the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits  the bank also utilizes other policy measures in its liquidity management activities 
as of december  and  the bank was in compliance with all of these policy measures 
in analyzing the company s liquidity during  reference is made to the company s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
the statement of cash flows includes separate categories for operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities included net income of million for  which was adjusted for certain non cash items including the provision for loan losses  depreciation  deferred income taxes  and an assortment of other miscellaneous items 
investing activities consisted primarily of both proceeds from and purchases of investment securities  which resulted in a net cash outflow of million  and the net change in total loans resulting from loan originations and principal collections  which resulted in a net cash outflow of million in financing activities reflected the net change in the company s total deposits  which increased million during  cash proceeds received during the year from the issuance of company common stock of million  and million in cash proceeds received in may from the issuance of the cumulative trust preferred securities 
in total  the transactions noted above resulted in a net cash inflow of million for and total cash and cash equivalents  as defined in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows  of million at december capital resources management seeks to maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks  and to ensure that the company and the bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines 
the primary source of new capital for the company has been the retention of earnings 
aside from current earnings  an additional source of new capital for the company has been the issuance of common stock under the company s employee benefit plans  including the company s stock option plans  defined contribution plans and employee stock purchase plan 
additionally  during the second quarter of the company issued million in cumulative trust preferred securities through a newly formed special purpose trust  svb capital i 
the securities had an offering price liquidation amount of per security and distributions at a fixed rate of are paid by the company quarterly 
the securities have a maximum maturity of years and qualify as tier capital under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve board 
the company received proceeds of million related to the sale of these securities  net of underwriting commissions and other offering expenses 
the proceeds are being used by the company for general corporate purposes  which may include  without limitation  investments in liquid government and corporate debt securities  and investments in venture capital funds 
the trust preferred securities are presented as a separate line item in the consolidated balance sheet of the company under the caption company obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures 
for additional related discussion  see item financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements trust preferred securities 
shareholders equity totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from the million balance at december  this increase was due to both net income of million and million in net capital generated during primarily through the company s employee benefit plans 
the company has not paid a cash dividend on its common stock since  and does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the table below presents the relationship between the following significant financial ratios years ended december  return on average assets divided by average equity as a percentage of average assets equals return on average equity times earnings retained equals internal capital growth the company and the bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the federal reserve board 
under these capital guidelines  the minimum total risk based capital ratio and tier risk based capital ratio requirements are and  respectively  of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items for a well capitalized depository institution 
the federal reserve board has also established minimum capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks 
the ratio is determined using tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets 
the guidelines require a minimum of for a well capitalized depository institution 
the company s and the bank s capital ratios were in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized depository institution as of december   and capital ratios for the company are set forth below december  total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio the company s total risk based capital ratio at the end of was unchanged from the prior year end and tier risk based capital ratio was slightly higher than the prior year end  as growth in tier capital was offset by an increase in total assets 
this increase in total assets was largely in lower risk weighted categories and resulted from the company s strong deposit growth exceeding its loan growth during the company s tier leverage ratio increased to from at december  this increase was largely attributable to the aforementioned issuance of million in cumulative trust preferred securities during through svb capital i 
the company s total risk based capital ratio and tier risk based capital ratio were unchanged at the end from the end of the decrease in the tier leverage ratio from december  to december  was primarily attributable to an increase in average total assets due to strong growth in deposits during see item financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters for the bank s capital ratios at december  and
