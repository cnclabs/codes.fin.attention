the results of operations of lpi  imperial eastman and the smaller acquisitions made during the periods  have been included in the company s results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 
the following discussion of the company s results of operations is based on the table below  which presents the company s results of operations separate from the company s repositioning and restructuring charges and segregates the results related to the company s discontinued operations from the results of the company s continuing operations for all periods presented dollars in thousands years ended the last day of february as restated net sales from continuing operations    operating costs cost of products sold before restructuring and repositioning charges    selling and administration    research and development    depreciation and amortization    total operating costs    operating income    interest expense    income from continuing operations  before provision for taxes    provision for taxes    income from continuing operations  before repositioning and restructuring charges    repositioning and restructuring charges  net of taxes represents pretax charges of million and million in and  respectively   income from continuing operations    income from discontinued operations income from operations  net of taxes    gain loss on divestitures  net of taxes   income loss from discontinued operations    extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt  net of tax benefits   net income    on a consolidated basis  net sales from continuing operations increased million in fiscal in comparison to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the automotive segment s internal sales growth and the inclusion of the results of operations of lpi and several smaller acquisitions made in fiscal and the latter half of fiscal in the company s automotive segment  net sales in fiscal increased million in comparison to fiscal internal sales growth  after adjusting for the lpi and smaller acquisitions  was million 
the internal growth was lead by the segment s oem oes sector  which increased approximately million in fiscal in comparison to fiscal oem oes growth of was driven primarily by the international markets  with a slower rate of growth of in the us the us growth was somewhat hampered by the gm strike which occurred earlier in the fiscal year 
in the aftermarket sector  internal sales growth was million in fiscal in comparison to fiscal the internal growth in this sector was led by growth in the us  which offset a slight decline in the international aftermarket 
in the industrial segment  net sales in fiscal increased million in comparison to fiscal internal sales  after adjusting for smaller acquisitions in the power transmission and fluid transfer sector  experienced a reduction amounting to million for fiscal in comparison to fiscal such reduction was primarily attributable to a significant decline in the global agricultural equipment markets in the last half of the fiscal year  along with weak petroleum and petrochemical markets experienced throughout the year 
these reductions were offset by record sales in the segment s transportation sector  which increased over comparable fiscal the segment s specialty filter sector also contributed to the increase  with internal sales growth of approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  consolidated net sales from continuing operations increased million in comparison to fiscal such sales were negatively effected by approximately million as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements during fiscal if exchange rates in fiscal had remained consistent with the rates in effect in fiscal  net sales from continuing operations in fiscal would have increased approximately in comparison to fiscal the increase in fiscal s sales was primarily attributable to internal growth  and to a lesser extent to the inclusion of the results of operations of lpi and several smaller acquisitions from their respective dates of acquisition 
in the company s automotive segment  net sales in fiscal increased million in comparison to fiscal internal sales growth in fiscal  was approximately in comparison to fiscal such growth was primarily generated by the segment s automotive oem sector  with oem growth in the us leading the way

the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to the effects in the first half of fiscal of duplicative costs and inefficiencies incurred due to additional time required to complete the company s restructuring program 
the company also experienced a negative effect on earnings from the general motors strike during fiscal the company began to experience improved margins in the latter half of fiscal  upon the substantial completion of its restructuring plan 
selling and administration costs as a percentage of consolidated net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the reduced level of costs reflects operating efficiencies achieved from the integration of the operations acquired and the reorganization of the company s business segments

over fiscal the diluted per share increase in fiscal is a result of reduced weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the company s stock repurchase program  which more than offset the effect of the decrease in income from continuing operations 
impact of inflation the competitive environment in which the company operates makes it extremely difficult to pass on increased costs to its customers 
in many instances  the company is not able to increase its prices at all  and in certain situations is forced to reduce its selling prices 
this environment makes it critical for the company to be able to operate in a continuously more efficient manner 
the company must also work closely with its suppliers to minimize price increases and push for pricing improvements in the same manner that its customers demand of the company 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer software programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s software programs  computer hardware or equipment that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  manufacture products or engage in other normal business activities 
the company has developed a formal plan to ensure that all of its significant date sensitive computer software and hardware systems information technology and other equipment utilized in its various manufacturing  distribution and administration activities utilizing embedded chips or software operating equipment will be year compliant and operational on a timely basis 
the plan addresses all of the company s locations throughout the world  and includes a review of computer applications that connect elements of the company s business directly to its customers and suppliers 
the plan also includes an assessment process to determine that the company s significant customers and suppliers third party activities will also be year compliant 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue includes four major phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
the company has substantially completed the assessment phase of its plan for all of its significant information technology and operating equipment that it believes could be affected by the year issue 
based upon its assessment  the company concluded that it would be necessary to reprogram and or replace certain of its information technology 
the company also determined that certain of its operating equipment would also require modifications to make sure they remain operational 
for its information technology exposures  the company is approximately complete on the remediation phase for all of its significant systems  and estimates that it will complete software reprogramming and or replacement by the end of the first quarter of fiscal to date  the company has completed approximately of its testing and has implemented approximately of the required remediation for such systems 
the testing and implementation phases are targeted to be substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal the remediation of operating equipment is approximately complete  and the company is targeting substantial completion of its related remediation efforts by the end of the first quarter of fiscal testing and implementation of the affected equipment is also targeted to be substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal with respect to third party activities  the company has made inquiries of its significant customers and suppliers and  at the present time  is not aware of problems that would materially impact the company s operations 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that these customers and suppliers and in turn their customers and suppliers will be year compliant in a timely manner 
the inability of these parties to successfully resolve their year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test  and implement the required year modifications 
the company s total cost to address the year issue is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flow 
the elements of such costs are as follows amounts in thousands incurred through costs yet total february  to be estimated incurred cost capital expenditures related to new systems and equipment    operating expenses related to modifications of existing systems and equipment    total costs    the company s plan to complete its year modifications is based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  and other factors 
management does not believe that the cost of achieving year compliance will significantly impact the results of the company s operations or its financial position 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the ability of the company s significant customers and suppliers and  in turn  their significant customers and suppliers to also achieve year compliance  and similar uncertainties 
the company presently believes that with modifications and replacement of existing hardware and software  and continued contact with its significant customers and suppliers  problems related to the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not successfully completed  and if the year plans of its significant customers and suppliers are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
euro conversion on january   the euro became the common currency of eleven of the fifteen member states of the european union 
after the introduction of the euro  the national currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries until mid calendar year during the dual currency phase  businesses must be capable of conducting commercial transactions in either the euro or the national currency 
after the dual currency phase  all businesses in participating countries must conduct all transactions in the euro and must convert their financial records and reports to be euro based 
the company expects that all its facilities will be capable of complying with the euro conversion timetable and with customer requirements for quoting and billing in euro dollars 
the company s information technology systems are currently meeting the dual currency phase requirements  and it is anticipated that the final phase of the euro conversion will not have a negative effect on the company
