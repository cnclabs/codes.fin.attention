the company s customers include telecommunications service providers and their customers  network equipment manufacturers  independent software developers and software platform vendors 
the company derives revenue primarily from software source license fees  royalties and services  including professional services  technical support and maintenance 
source license fees consist primarily of licenses of the company s tmn software products and development platforms 
the company recognizes product revenue upon delivery if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivables is probable and no significant production  modification or customization of software is required 
for contracts with multiple elements eg  software products  maintenance services and other services  the company allocates revenue to each element of the contract based on objective evidence of the element s fair value 
this objective evidence of fair value is specific to the company and consists either of prices derived from sales of elements when they are sold separately or the price established by management for sale of elements in the ordinary course of business

year issues general 
the company is currently conducting a company wide year readiness program yk program 
the yk program is addressing the issue of computer programs and embedded computer chips being unable to distinguish between the year and the year therefore  some computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company anticipates that year compliance will be substantially complete by april y program 
the company s yk program is divided into four major sections company developed products  internal information processing ip system  non ip system  and third party suppliers and customers 
the general phases common to all sections are inventorying year items  assessing the year compliance of items determined to be material to the company  and repairing or replacing material items that are determined not to be year compliant 
the company has completed the review of all company developed products for year compliance purposes 
the company believes that most of the company s products are year compliant and that those that are not year compliant will be upgraded to be year compliant by april  or discontinued and replaced with year compliant products providing the same functionality 
however  to the extent that others  such as system integrators  make use of the company s software in developing solutions for third parties  the company may have no knowledge as to the year readiness of those third party products 
in addition it is possible that third parties could assert claims against the company or its customers concerning year issues and regardless of their merits or lack thereof  and such claims could be material 
the company has completed an evaluation of year issues associated with its internal ip computer systems 
most of the company s computer systems are already year compliant 
other internal computer systems that have been identified as non compliant will be upgraded to be year compliant by march the company has completed an evaluation of year issues associated with its non ip systems 
most of them are year compliant 
those non ip systems that are not year compliant will be repaired or replaced by june the company has completed an evaluation of the possible effects on the company s operations of the year readiness of its key suppliers 
the company relies on third party manufacturers for the proper functioning of its information systems  software and products 
the failure of those manufacturers to address year issues could have a material impact on the company s operations and financial results  however  the potential impact and related costs are not known at this time 
costs 
the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
through december   the company has spent less than  to implement the year compliance program 
that amount has been expensed 
the company estimates that it may spend up to an additional  for other replacements or upgrades and for communicating with key suppliers and customers 
approximately  of that amount will relate to new computer equipment and software and will be capitalized  and the remainder will be expensed as incurred 
risks 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the yk program is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the yk program as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
the company does not yet have a contingency plan to address the year problem  but it is expected to create one by june if it appears that the company or its key suppliers and customers will not be year compliant and that such non compliance is expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a quantitative information about market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company maintains an investment policy that ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
as of december   the company had  and  in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  respectively  with a weighted average variable rate and  respectively 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor and by placing its portfolio under the management of professional money managers who invest within specified parameters established by the board of directors 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
the company currently has no short term or long term debt outstanding 
b qualitative information about market risk while the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states dollars  a portion of the company s worldwide operations have a functional currency other than the united states dollar 
in particular  the company maintains operations in france  germany  japan  korea and the united kingdom  where the functional currencies are french francs  deutschemarks  yen  won and british pounds  respectively 
most of the company s revenues are denominated in the united states dollar 
fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and could also result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations cannot be predicted adequately 
to date  exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s earnings and the company has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates  but may undertake such transactions in the future 
the company does not have a policy relating to hedging 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by the company would be successful or that the company s results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
c euro impact in january  eleven european countries  including france and germany  where the company maintains operations  implemented a single currency the euro to replace their separate currencies 
while transactions may still be consummated in the individual currencies of the member countries  the company will be required to  and is currently in the process of  implementing modifications to its payroll and benefits systems as well as its contracts and other obligations in order to accommodate the euro 
the company does not currently believe that it will incur a material financial expense in connection with such modifications 
the introduction of the euro  presents certain risks for the company including  risks associated with its reduced ability to adjust pricing of its products based on local currencies  fluctuations in the euro based on economic turmoil in countries other than those in which the company does business and other risks normally associated with doing business in international currencies  any of which could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
