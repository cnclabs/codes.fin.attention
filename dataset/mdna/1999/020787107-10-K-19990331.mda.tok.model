item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general the company is a single source provider of it products  services and support to fortune and other large and mid sized companies located primarily in the new york to philadelphia corridor 
the company was formed in as an authorized reseller of computer hardware and software products  and since has been developing and offering related it services 
to date  most of the company s net sales have been derived from it product sales 
in  net product sales were and services and support revenue was of the company s net sales  compared with net product sales of and services and support revenue of in the company has entered into distribution agreements with ingram and pinacor  two of the nation s largest aggregators  to acquire most of its it products for resale 
the company s relationship with pinacor commenced in and  as customer demand for it products grew  the company initiated its relationship with ingram in the distribution agreements with pinacor and ingram give the company access to such aggregators extensive inventories and provide the company with electronic ordering capability  product configuration and testing  warehousing and delivery 
in general  the company orders it products  including workstations  servers  enterprise computing products  networking and communications equipment  and applications software from such aggregators on an as needed basis  thereby reducing the company s need to carry large inventories 
during  the company acquired approximately and of its products for resale from ingram and pinacor  respectively 
except for the mta contract entered into in december  in general  there are no ongoing written commitments by customers to purchase products from the company and all product sales are made on a purchase order basis 
furthermore  as the market for it products has matured  price competition has intensified and is likely to continue to intensify 
during  the company s gross profits  margins and results of operations were adversely affected by such continued product pricing pressure and by a significant reduction in product purchase orders from the company s customers 
in addition  the company s gross profits  margins and results of operations could be adversely affected by a disruption in the company s sources of product supply 
the company offers network consulting  workstation support  applications development  communications installation  education  help desk  remote network management  it staffing and internet related services 
services and support revenue is recognized as such services are performed 
the company s network consulting  workstation support and communications installation services are billed on a time and materials basis 
the company s education and it staffing services are fee based on a per course and per placement basis  respectively 
generally  the company s service arrangements with its customers may be terminated by such customers with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
the most significant cost relating to the services component of the company s business is personnel costs which consist of salaries  benefits and payroll related expenses 
thus  the financial performance of the company s service business is based primarily upon billing margins billable hourly rates less the costs to the company of such service personnel on an hourly basis and utilization rates billable hours divided by paid hours 
the future success of the services component of the company s business will depend in large part upon its ability to maintain high utilization rates at profitable billing margins 
the competition for quality technical personnel has continued to intensify resulting in increased personnel costs for the company and many other it service providers  which has adversely affected the company s billing margins 
the company implemented a reduction in force in june due to lower than expected demand for the company s services from certain clients 
in addition  in january  the company implemented a second reduction  eliminating positions consisting principally of persons supporting product sales 
the company may receive manufacturer rebates resulting from equipment sales 
in addition  the company receives volume discounts and other incentives from certain of its suppliers 
except for products in transit or products awaiting configuration at a company facility  the company generally does not maintain large inventory balances 
the company s primary vendors have announced or instituted changes in their price protection and inventory management programs as a direct result of changes in such policies by manufacturers 
specifically  they have announced that they will i limit price protection to that provided by the manufacturer  generally less than days  rather than the unlimited protection previously available  and ii restrict product returns  other than defective returns  to a percentage the percentage varies depending on the vendor and when the return is made of product purchased  during a defined period  at the lower of the invoiced price or the current price  subject to the specific manufacturer s requirements and restrictions 
at the present time  the company does not believe these changes in the vendor policies will have a material impact on its business 
other than changes in such price protection and return policies  the company is unaware that any of its suppliers or manufacturers have changed or intend to further change these programs 
there can be no assurances that any such rebates  discounts or incentives will continue at historical levels  if at all 
further adverse modification  restriction or reduction in such programs could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company s cost of sales includes primarily  in the case of product sales  the cost to the company of products acquired for resale  and in the case of services and support revenue  salaries and related expenses for billable technical personnel 
the company s selling expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including sales commissions earned by employees involved in the sales of it products  services and support 
these personnel include direct sales  sales support and marketing personnel 
sales commissions are recorded as revenue is recognized 
general and administrative expenses consist of all other operating expenses  including primarily salaries and related expenses  depreciation and occupancy costs 
during the last three fiscal years  the gross margins earned on services and support sales decreased from for  to for  and for this decline in gross margins is attributable to increased competition  lower utilization rates  the impact of the mta contract and services and support revenue increasing at a slower rate than related personnel and recruiting costs 
recent declines in product and services support sales have resulted in lower utilization rates and margins 
in response to these trends  the company is emphasizing its higher margin  value added services and support offerings  including  among other services  network integration  applications development and internet related offerings 
if these trends continue into  the company will examine the advisability of additional reductions in force 
the company believes that its ability to provide a broad range of technical services  coupled with its traditional strength in satisfying its customers it product requirements and its long term relationships with large customers  positions the company to continue to grow the services component of its business 
as such  the company anticipates that an increasing percentage of its gross profits in the future will be derived from the services and support component of its business 
however  in the near term  the company believes that product sales will continue to generate a significant percentage of the company s gross profit 
the company s ability to be a single source provider of it products  services and support enables it to earn margins higher than it would earn if it sold products only 
the company s net sales  gross profit  operating income and net income have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and are expected to do so in the future 
many factors  some of which are not within the company s control  have contributed and may in the future contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
these factors include the short term nature of the company s customers commitments  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing  size  and mix of product and service orders and deliveries  the timing and size of new projects  pricing changes in response to various competitive factors  market factors affecting the availability of qualified technical personnel  timing and customer acceptance of new product and service offerings  changes in trends affecting outsourcing of it services  disruption in sources of supply  changes in product  personnel  and other operating costs  and industry and general economic conditions 
operating results have been and may in the future also be affected by the cost  timing and other effects of acquisitions  including the mix of product and service revenues of acquired companies 
the company believes  therefore  that past operating results and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future operating performance 
the company experienced negative operating results during the quarter ended september  primarily due to the one time write off of capitalized software and consulting fees associated with the company s termination of an integrated accounting software program and implementation thereof 
during the quarter ended december   the company experienced negative operating results primarily due to reduced unit volume and lower average selling prices on product sales 
in addition  reduced demand by certain customers for the company s services and support offerings lowered the utilization rates of billable personnel during the quarter  and the effect of the mta contract see below negatively impacted gross profits 
the company s operating results have been and in the future will continue to be impacted by changes in technical personnel billing and utilization rates 
many of the company s costs  particularly costs associated with services and support revenue  such as administrative support personnel and facilities costs  are for the most part fixed costs 
the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
technical personnel utilization rates have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected during periods of rapid and concentrated hiring 
depending upon the availability of qualified technical personnel  during periods of rapid growth the company has utilized and in the future is likely to utilize contract personnel  which also adversely affects gross margins 
due to these and other factors  if the company is successful in expanding its service offerings and revenue  periods of variability in utilization are likely to reoccur 
in addition  during such periods the company is likely to incur greater technical training costs 
quarterly results also may be impacted due to the fact that certain compensation based employment taxes are limited per employee per calendar year and  as a result  the company experienced a decrease in employment taxes as a percentage of revenue during the calendar year 
in december  the company entered into a four year  million contract with the mta to furnish and install local and wide area computer network components including network and telecommunication hardware  software and cabling throughout the mta s over locations to extend the benefits of automation to the mta s operations  including subway stations  electrical power substations and a diverse group of train car maintenance facilities 
the company is the prime contractor responsible for project management  systems procurement and installation 
the work is grouped in contiguous locations and payment is predicated upon achieving specific milestone events 
while the company is currently performing in accordance with the contract terms  there can be no assurances that any such events would not occur 
in the event of default  in addition to all other remedies at law  the mta reserves the right to terminate the services of the company and complete the contract itself at the company s cost 
in the event of unexcused delay by the company  the company may be obligated to pay  as liquidated damages  the sum of per day 
in addition the contract is a fixed unit price contract  and the quantities are approximate  for which the mta has expressly reserved the right  for each item  to direct the amount of equipment be increased  decreased or omitted entirely on days notice 
further  the mta has the right to suspend the work on days notice for up to days and or terminate the contract  at any time  on notice  paying only for the work performed to the date of termination 
the project is subject to the prevailing wage rate and classification for telecommunication workers  managed by the new york city controller s office  over which the company has no control  and which is generally adjusted in june of each year and may be so adjusted in the future 
the company has performed services and supplied products to the mta since the inception of the mta contract 
the work performed to date has required greater than estimated labor and other costs to complete 
such increased labor and other costs may also be incurred at other sites 
the company has requested the mta for an equitable adjustment in the contract amount and terms 
however  there can be no assurance the mta will approve  either in whole or in part  any equitable adjustment in the contract amount or terms requested by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company can complete the contract without incurring a loss 
currently  the company is recording revenues under the mta contract equal to costs incurred 
however  if the company is unsuccessful in obtaining equitable adjustments  realizing increased performance efficiencies or otherwise improving its margins  the company believes it will sustain a loss under the contract 
the aggregate revenues generated and costs incurred from the mta contract for the fiscal year ended december  were approximately million 
year readiness disclosure historically  certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in computer recognizing a date using as the year rather than the year this  in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations  and is generally referred to herein as the year problem 
computer systems that are able to deal correctly with dates after are referred to as year compliant 
over the past several years  based upon its business needs  the company has purchased and installed hardware and software which is represented by the manufacturers to be year compliant 
the company has reviewed its state of readiness and has determined that  with the exception of the company s current integrated accounting systems  which is not year compliant  the company believes its installed base of computer hardware and software systems to be year compliant 
with respect to the company s integrated accounting system  in october of the company announced the purchase of platinum sql software  to replace the current integrated accounting system 
the project plan establishes may for completion of implementation 
based upon the representations of the manufacturers of hardware and software used by the company  and the provider of the platinum sql software  the company believes upon implementation of platinum sql  the company s internal business systems  including its computer systems  will be year compliant 
there can be no assurance  however  that the year problem relating to the company s systems will not adversely affect its business  financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  the company initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to the failure of those third parties to remediate their own year problem 
the company expects to be receiving and reviewing the responses to these communications and following up with such suppliers and customers as needed or appropriate 
the company expects this phase to be substantially completed by approximately june  however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s system relies will be remedied in a timely manner  or that a failure to remedy by another company will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company resells it products of leading hardware manufacturers and software developers 
as a result  the company has no control over the developments of computer systems  software products or other business systems developed by such third parties 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the computer systems  software products or other business systems sold by the company will accept input of  store  manipulate and or output dates in the year or thereafter without error or interruption 
as a result  the company  as a reseller  may be liable for such failures 
given the company s role in the distribution of such products  the company is not able to accurately determine the extent  if any  of such potential liability 
in addition  the purchasing patterns of the company s customers and potential customers may be affected by issues associated with the year problem 
as companies devote significant resources to become year compliant  these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products or obtain services such as those offered by the company 
there can be no assurance that the year problem will not adversely affect the company s business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the total cost of the company s year compliance is being funded through operating cash flows 
the estimated cost to purchase and install platinum sql is approximately  excluding costs associated with platinum sql and the write off of the capitalized software and consulting fees  the company has expended approximately million on hardware and software upgrades for its year compliance 
the company does not currently anticipate that it will incur any additional material expenditures for such year compliance 
the aforementioned costs do not include any costs associated with any third party being year non compliant  nor do such costs include internal personnel costs primarily salaries and benefits  which the company does not separately track 
such costs also do not include any contingency plan costs at this point 
the company has not developed a contingency plan in the event the platinum sql project is not completed in a timely manner or with respect to any additional year compliant issues which may arise as a result of the company s inquiries of its suppliers and customers 
such plans may be developed as and if the need for any such plans arise 
statements included in this year readiness disclosure are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the possibility that the currently installed computer systems  software products or other business systems of the company or its distributors  manufacturers or customers  working either alone or in conjunction with other software or systems  will not accept input of  store  manipulate and or output dates in the year or thereafter without error or interruption 
such risks and uncertainties may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements contained in this report
