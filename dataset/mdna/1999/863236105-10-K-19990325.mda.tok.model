item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed elsewhere in the company s form k dated december  as filed with the securities and exchange commission 
background and overview the university is a regional proprietary institution of higher education offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs at eleven campuses in the greater washington  dc area 
the company was incorporated in may to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of the university and elp from mr 
and mrs 
ron k 
bailey  the previous sole stockholders of the university 
upon completion of the company s initial public offering in july  the university and elp  which administers the sel program  became direct subsidiaries of the company 
revenues  operating income  and pro forma net income have increased in each of the last three years 
from through  revenues increased approximately  operating income increased approximately  and net income increased 
over the three year period  tuition revenue accounted for approximately of total revenue 
the number of students increased approximately from  at the beginning of the fall quarter to  at the beginning of the fall quarter  and tuition rates increased approximately over the last three years 
the university s principal source of revenue is tuition collected from its students 
the academic year of the university is divided into four quarters  which approximately coincide with the four quarters of the calendar year 
students generally must pay the entire tuition for each course prior to the beginning of the quarter 
if a student withdraws from a course prior to completion  the university refunds a portion of the tuition 
when students register for courses  tuition is recorded as unearned tuition  which is recognized as courses are taught through the academic quarter 
revenues also consist in part of fees and other revenues derived principally from application fees  no show fees  and bookstore sales 
when a student registers for a course but does not attend any classes  the university may have no place in the course for another student and therefore imposes a no show fee on the registered student 
beginning in  the company contracted out its bookstore operations to a third party 
unless otherwise indicated  student enrollment information presented herein reflects enrollment as of the beginning of the fall academic quarter for the applicable year  which is the beginning of the academic year and the industry practice for measuring enrollments at educational institutions 
the university records tuition receivable when students register for the academic quarter  generally prior to the end of the previous academic quarter 
because the university s academic quarters coincide with the calendar quarters  tuition receivable at the end of any calendar quarter largely represents student tuition due for the following academic quarter 
based upon past experience and judgment  the university establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable not included in unearned tuition 
any uncollected account more than six months past due is charged against the allowance

if the university decides to purchase additional campus facilities  it may finance such acquisitions with indebtedness 
year the year issue concerns the potential exposures related to the automated generation of business and financial misinformation resulting from the application of computer programs that have been written using six digits eg   rather than eight eg   to define the applicable year of business 
this date definition limitation could  unless corrected  cause some computer programs  hardware and non information technology systems to be unable to process information containing dates after december  the company has completed the identification and assessment of most of its it systems  and those systems have been modified by the suppliers of those systems to address year issues 
in no case is a system replaced solely because of year issues  although in some cases  the timing of system replacement is being accelerated 
in addition to its internal systems  the company has begun to assess the level of year issues with its suppliers 
the company has also started its identification and assessment of its non it systems  which include its telephone systems  heating and air conditioning  elevators and other business equipment 
this non it systems assessment should be completed by june  the company s costs to date for its year compliance project  excluding the salaries of its employees  have not been material 
in fact  the company s it systems have been modified by the suppliers of those systems and such modifications were included as part of normal upgrades of those systems 
although the company has not completed its assessment  it does not currently believe that the future costs associated with its remaining it systems or its non it systems will be material 
the company has begun to assess the year readiness of its banking and governmental agencies to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable in the event that those parties fail to properly remediate their own year issues 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from the student funding provided by title iv programs 
the department of education processes the applications for this funding 
the department of education has stated that its systems will be year compliant by march  and that schools will be able to test the remediated systems during the first half of in january  the department reported that of its mission critical systems were year compliant and that the remaining two systems would be year compliant by march  the department s office of the inspector general has supported the department s conclusion that all of its mission critical systems related to student financial aid delivery will be year compliant by march  in the most recent report card of year progress for federal agencies  the house subcommittee on government management  information  and technology gave the department of education a grade of a 
the company cannot determine currently its most likely worst case scenario  as it has not identified and assessed all of its systems  particularly its non it systems 
as the company completes its identification and assessment of internal and third party systems  it expects to develop contingency plans for various worst case scenarios 
a failure to address year issues successfully could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s historical operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of its investments 
the company invests its excess cash in marketable securities and certificates of deposit 
at december  the company s investments include certificates of deposit  money market funds  us government obligations primarily fixed income securities and high quality equity securities 
the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale as of december  the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
these securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
investments in certificates of deposit and money market funds may adversely impact future earnings due to a decrease in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   a increase or decline in interest rates will not have a material impact on the company s future earnings  fair values  or cash flows related to investments in certificates of deposit or interest earning marketable securities 
in addition  as of december   a decrease in market values would not have a material impact on the company s future earning  fair values  financial position or cash flows related to investments in marketable equity securities
