this was due to the issuance of shares in mid for the acquisition of premier bankshares 
the return on average equity was in compared to in this is below the reported by the corporation s peer group of similarly sized banks because of the high level of capital the corporation maintains

the corporation s ability to control expenses is reflected in the efficiency ratio of in compared to in and to the peer group average of 
this low expense level is achieved despite the relatively higher costs incurred by first virginia in maintaining an extensive branch network 
the low cost deposits generated by these branches is one of the primary factors in the corporation s ability to achieve a high net interest margin

the corporation s super community bank status and reputation for personal service became even more attractive as all of the other major banks in virginia were acquired and merged into large out of state banks 
by the end of the year  first virginia was the largest  independent bank holding company headquartered in virginia 
the corporation strengthened its position on the maryland and virginia eastern shore during by acquiring offices from competitors  giving it the number two market share by the end of also during  the corporation sold seven offices in maryland s montgomery and baltimore counties  after concluding that achieving a meaningful market share in these communities was not feasible

statement of income net interest income the table on pages thru details the increase in earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and demand deposits for the last three years  along with the related levels of fully taxable equivalent interest income and expense 
the variance in interest income and expense caused by differences in average balances and rates is shown on pages and the national economy continued to grow in  with the nation experiencing its longest expansion of the century 
the worldwide economic situation was not as favorable  however  as the russian and many asian economies collapsed  entering into deflationary conditions 
while these international crises do not affect first virginia directly  they did trigger a decline in interest rates in the last four months of the year as the resultant flight to quality drove yields on some us treasury securities to record lows 
the federal reserve lowered the discount rate and target rate for overnight securities several times and the prime interest rate was lowered three times in the last four months of the year 
these declines in interest rates resulted in a drop in first virginia s net interest margin of seven basis points to in  following an increase of basis points in when rates were more stable 
first virginia maintains a very liquid position for both its assets and liabilities so that movements in interest rates do not have a material impact on the net interest margin 
in addition  first virginia relies almost entirely on its branch network to supply it with a relatively low cost source of funds and has no purchased funds and does not need to hedge its position with derivative securities of any kind 
this has produced one of the highest net interest margins among the country s largest banks on a consistent basis  and was the st consecutive year that first virginia had a net interest margin of at least 
net interest margin the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion in source keefe  bruyette woods the yield on earning assets declined basis points in to after rising basis points in part of this decline in was caused by a shift in the mix of earning assets from loans into relatively lower yielding short term investments such as money market investments and investment securities 
due to the faster deposit growth rate compared to the growth in loans  the loans to total earning assets percentage dropped to compared to in the decline in interest rates in resulted in lower yields in most categories of earning assets  particularly in investment securities  which dropped basis points in yield to 
the yield on loans declined seven basis points in  following a rise of four basis points in with most of the decline occurring on the commercial side 
the yields on consumer installment loans and real estate loans were relatively unchanged compared to since these rates are less sensitive to changes in the interest rate market 
however  by the end of  rates for consumer loans began dropping  and the declines in this category may impact the corporation more adversely in after several years of interest rate stability for deposits  the cost of these funds began to drop in the last four months of this resulted in a slight  three basis point decline in the cost of funds to for after remaining unchanged in and at 
the cost of interest checking deposits dropped basis points to as a result of the general decline in interest rates and as the acquisition of some former competitors by larger out of state banks lessened price competition for these deposits 
the cost of money market deposits increased basis points to in as the corporation began a campaign in late to attract more of these relatively low cost deposits 
this resulted in an increase of in average outstanding balances at a cost considerably less than alternative sources of funds 
consumer certificates of deposit rose two basis points in cost in to following a basis point decline in as it became apparent that interest rates were declining in  consumers demonstrated a preference for longer term instruments and sought to lock in a higher yield by extending the term of their certificates 
in  consumers had shown a preference for shorter term certificates following several years of relatively stable rates 
the cost of funds for consumer certificates of deposit should decline during as interest rates on these instruments were cut sharply in the fourth quarter of and maturing instruments are repriced at much lower rates 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased million in to million compared to a 
million decline in the provision covered actual net loan charge offs in plus an amount related to loan growth 
the corporation s loan portfolio consists primarily of small  homogeneous loans to consumers with a consistent pattern of small loss 
net charge offs equaled 
of average loans during  
in  and 
in  and over the past ten years have averaged 
of average loans 
the corporation has a lower risk exposure to charge offs than many banks because the majority of its loans are made in small amounts to consumers and are generally well secured by assets such as an automobile or real estate 
these loans also have regular monthly repayment schedules  and their average duration is substantially less than their stated lives 
credit card loans are made primarily to the banks customers located in the corporation s trade area and contain a lesser degree of risk and delinquency than many banks nationally solicited accounts 
the balance of the corporation s loans are made primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the corporation s trade area and are well secured 
the corporation does not have any international  national or highly leveraged credits  nor does it have any concentration of credit in any one industry that exposes the loan portfolio to adverse risk 
while approximately of the corporation s loan portfolio is comprised of automobile sector loans  the loans are for relatively small amounts to consumers and have regular monthly payment schedules and are of the highest quality so that the risk of exposure is very limited 
the corporation has avoided the sub prime segment of both the automobile and home equity loan markets 
noninterest income noninterest income  excluding security gains and losses  increased in to million  compared to a increase to million in first virginia increased the percentage of its gross income received from noninterest sources to in compared to in  furthering its objective to increase its share of income from noninterest sources in order to reduce the dependence of net income on net interest income 
because of the largely consumer nature of the corporation s business  it has been more historically dependent on net interest income 
during  the corporation made significant strides to improving its noninterest sources of income  and it anticipates an even greater percentage of income to come from these activities in income from service charges on deposits increased to million and is the single largest component of noninterest income 
a part of the increase in service charge income was a increase in interest checking and demand deposits 
in the fourth quarter  the corporation began implementing a customer value based approach to service charges 
this approach involved determining the value of each customer s relationship to the corporation  examining what the customer expected from the relationship and then setting the appropriate service schedule based on that review 
this review has been well received by customers and has resulted in a better level of service value to the customer and higher income for the corporation 
it is anticipated that this approach will increase service fee income by approximately million in income from insurance activities increased in after declining in the corporation has increased its insurance agency sales significantly in the past several years  and in commissions and premiums in this area advanced 
sales of title insurance were particularly strong due to increased penetration and the higher volume of real estate activity in insurance products sold through the member banks  in a combination of direct mail  telemarketing and agent sales  to consumers and businesses all increased strongly 
offsetting the strong increase in insurance agency sales was a decline in premium income from the sale of credit life and disability insurance 
credit insurance sales have been steadily declining for a number of years as state mandated rate reductions and a decreasing volume of loans generated in the branch offices resulted in fewer sales opportunities 
income from trust services increased in following a increase in and a increase in the net margin in this line of business has improved significantly over the last several years as more emphasis has been placed on new sales  larger account balances and more commercial trust services 
credit card fee income increased in both and as volumes rose modestly 
in the fourth quarter  the corporation was required to sell a large affinity credit card program that equaled approximately one third of the total credit card portfolio 
as a result of this sale  credit card income in is expected to decline appreciably although overall profitability will not be materially impacted 
in connection with this sale  a gain of million was recorded in other income 
also included in other income was a gain of million from the sale of seven offices in maryland 
in  other income included a gain of million from the sale of three branches in southwest virginia that were required to be divested as part of the acquisition of premier bankshares corporation 
in prior years  the corporation regularly made a sale of mortgage servicing rights and realized gains of million in both and in late  the servicing activities of the corporation s mortgage loan subsidiary were largely eliminated and mortgage loans are now originated and sold with servicing released so that no servicing gain was recorded in or will occur in future years 
other income also includes origination fees for automobile leases originated and sold to a third party provider for a fee 
after increasing significantly in and  fees from this source dropped in and another in as the attractiveness of the leasing product changed dramatically with the reduction of residual values on the leased vehicles 
electronic banking service fees increased in following and increases in and changes in network rules permitted the assessment of fees on non first virginia customers of the corporation s automated teller machines atms in mid  and the corporation s extensive atm network has proven to be highly convenient to customers who want to use this service 
in addition  the corporation has increased its placement of atms in nonbranch locations such as airports  grocery stores  shopping centers and other special high traffic locations in order to increase its income from these fees 
the corporation offers an online debit service that may be utilized at retailers across the nation  but fraud concerns have precluded its introducing an off line debit card 
the corporation recognized gains of million from the sale of equity securities in the corporation s policy is to hold virtually all of its fixed income securities to maturity and  accordingly  there were no security sales producing gains or losses in  with the exception of some bonds called by the issuer prior to the maturity date 
in  the corporation sold a portfolio of securities in the available for sale category for a gain of million in order to take advantage of certain tax loss carry forwards and benefits 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased in and in compared to a increase in however  excluding the impact of additional expenses in connection with the acquisition of premier bankshares  accounted for using the purchase method  and the purchase of branch offices in on the eastern shore of maryland and virginia  expenses in and would have been up less than in each year 
the efficiency ratio has been relatively stable  increasing slightly in to compared to in and the achieved in efficiency ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group salaries and employee benefits increased in and in due in part to the additional branch offices purchased and the acquisition of premier in pension plan expense increased in after falling in as the discount rate assumption for future benefit liabilities declined in by basis points after increasing basis points in the discount rate assumption changes each year based on current interest rate levels for long term investment grade securities 
the rising stock market has created a better than expected return on plan assets in recent years  and this  in turn  has contributed to a lower than expected increase in expense and a full funding of the plan as plan assets exceed projected plan obligations 
health care costs  after remaining relatively stable in the mid s  have begun to accelerate  increasing in and in stock related compensation costs declined in to million after rising million in this expense fluctuates based on the movement of the stock price  however  in the corporation redeemed all outstanding stock appreciation rights and changed the vesting criteria for future grants of stock options in order to eliminate the volatility and reduce the absolute level of this expense in future years 
occupancy expenses increased only in despite the increase in the number of branch offices and the acquisition of premier bankshares in milder weather reduced utility expenses and the branch offices sold in maryland were relatively more expensive to maintain than the branch offices acquired 
occupancy had increased in due primarily to the acquisition of premier bankshares 
equipment expense increased in following an increase of in and in the corporation has updated its branch automation software over the past several years to the most current versions now in use and increased the capability of its delivery systems 
expenses increased in as a result of equipment and program upgrades required to prepare the corporation s systems for the year the amortization of intangibles increased million in to million following a rise of million in the increase in was due in part to the acquisition of branch offices from competitors and the payment of a deposit intangible of million that is being amortized over a period of ten years 
in addition  the premier bankshares acquisition caused intangibles amortization expense to increase in and other noninterest expense rose in and in due in part to the inclusion of premier bankshares in both years 
a increase in advertising expense also increased noninterest expense as the corporation capitalized on the consolidations and mergers in its markets to attract new customers 
legal and professional fees increased million with the use of outside consultants for some year conversion work  higher legal fees related to routine lawsuits and fees related to the corporation s new approach to service charges on deposit accounts 
telecommunication expenses also rose in as a result of increased capabilities of the corporation s voice and data lines 
noninterest expense had increased over as a result of higher bank franchise taxes in virginia caused by higher asset and capital levels but declined in as capital in the corporation s banks was reduced 
provision for income taxes income tax expense in increased million to million as a result of the increase in pretax income 
the effective tax rate in both and was and there were no material changes in the components of taxable income or tax rates 
in  the effective tax rate had increased 
from in as a result of a greater amount of nondeductible expenses for tax purposes 
balance sheet first virginia s lending portfolio is its primary earning asset and generates approximately of gross income 
nearly all earning assets are funded from deposits originated through the corporation s network of branch offices or from capital 
other sources of funding include customer repurchase agreements and commercial paper originated from business customers who utilize the corporation s cash management products  which are functionally equivalent to deposits 
the corporation does not fund any of its earning assets from purchased deposits or other nondeposit funding sources  nor does it sell or securitize any of its earning assets 
the corporation s objective is to invest of its total deposits and short term borrowings in loans 
in  the loan to funding liabilities rate was  a decline from the funding rate achieved in this decline was a result of a faster rate of growth in funding liabilities than the growth in loans 
the table below shows the average balances of the various categories of earning assets as a percentage of total earning assets for the years indicated

other earning assets 




money market investments 
loans loans outstanding at the end of increased over s year end numbers following an growth in over the end of the growth in loans outstanding in was primarily the result of the premier bankshares acquisition  while the increase came from loans generated internally 
the largest component of first virginia s loan portfolio is in automobile related loans  particularly loans originated through automobile dealerships 
the corporation is a full service provider to the automobile dealership community and makes loans to consumers to finance their purchase of automobiles and loans to dealers to finance their inventory of automobiles and  to a lesser extent  their physical plant and facilities 
as the corporation has exploited this expertise over the past five years  the percentage of loans that are automobile related increased from of the loan portfolio at the end of  to at the end of consumer car loans expanded by in  after growing in and in during  the corporation consolidated all of its dealer automobile origination activities into a separate company to enhance its service capabilities by centralizing management and taking advantage of new technology 
as a consequence  new loan production increased in compared to a increase in the corporation did not open any new loan production offices in  however  two offices will open in the first quarter of in pittsburgh and atlanta 
the corporation plans to continue its strategy of gradually expanding its market with additional loan production offices  primarily in the southeastern and mid atlantic regions 
first virginia concentrates on the highest quality of automobile loans  primarily a and b credits 
most of these loans are made to consumers and are secured by new cars with a maximum term of five years 
the loan portfolio s high quality means net charge offs are significantly below industry averages and servicing and funding costs are among the lowest in the industry  giving the corporation a competitive advantage over less efficient producers 
first virginia uses an experienced loan reviewer in underwriting each loan in these local loan production offices and does not rely on credit scoring models 
this allows the corporation to give highly personal service and quick approval to the dealer originating the loan 
once made  the loans are serviced centrally to insure consistency and quality of collection at the lowest cost 
the corporation also makes loans directly to dealers to finance their sales inventory floor plan loans  which are fully secured by specific automobiles 
average floor plan loans declined in  in  and in as dealers have been managing their inventories to turn over vehicles more rapidly 
in addition  sales of automobiles have been consistently strong over the past three years  reducing the time cars spend on a dealer s lot 
the corporation s automotive finance business introduced a leasing product in late with a partner who assumed all the risks for the leases 
after growing rapidly through and early  the leasing business has declined significantly as consumer terms were tightened 
in late  the corporation began offering loans to subprime customers through its dealer network with the risks assumed by a third party partner  and it anticipates generating additional fee income from this product in first virginia is committed to being a full financial service provider to the automobile market  regardless of swings in the economic cycle  and it devotes its primary lending resources to this area 
the second largest component of the corporation s lending portfolio is home equity loans comprising approximately of outstanding loans at the end of these loans have declined steadily with the exception of a increase in caused by the premier bankshares acquisition 
in  they declined an average of  as interest rates on mortgages reached their lowest level in years 
the low mortgage rates generated a strong refinance market for mortgage loans  and consumers paid off their home equity loans and consolidated their debt into lower cost mortgage loans 
this refinancing activity continued throughout the year  driving home equity lending down at the end of compared to the end of first virginia pursues the highest quality home equity loans with low loan to value ratios that enable the corporation to show a nominal net charge off rate 
these loans are originated through the banks branches and through first general mortgage company  a home equity mortgage loan company that operates in areas outside the corporation s banking markets 
in the last three years  the corporation has responded to market demand and increased the residential real estate percentage of its loan portfolio to compared to at the end of residential real estate loans increased in to million after rising in and in the corporation s real estate loan portfolio has not been as subject to early prepayment as some other banks portfolios because it limits itself primarily to year  fixed rate loans 
these loans do not contain the same prepayment risk as adjustable rate mortgages or mortgages of longer contractual lives that are likely to be refinanced when interest rates decline 
revolving credit loans  primarily credit cards  declined in when a large credit card affinity relationship was required to be sold in the fourth quarter 
internal growth also slowed over the last three years  as fewer direct mail solicitations have been made both for the corporation s own portfolio and affinity programs 
first virginia promotes its credit cards by offering one of the best low fixed rate  no annual fee card products in its market 
the corporation limits its solicitation efforts to the geographic area of its banks 
increased competition from other financial institutions limited the increase in commercial loans excluding automobile dealer floor plan loans to in after advancing in three quarter percent decreases in the prime rate in late also contributed to more pay offs in both and as borrowers refinanced their commercial loans with competitors 
the exceptional increase in outstanding loans in was a direct result of the acquisition of premier bankshares  which had a greater percentage of its loan portfolio in this area 
the corporation makes its loans to small and medium sized businesses in the communities served by its member banks  including loans to government contractors  high tech companies  hospitals  churches and country clubs 
these loans are typically in amounts between to million  generally with a maximum amount of million 
construction and land development loans increased in after increasing in commercial property construction in the corporation s market increased significantly over the past three years following virtually no activity in the early s  however  more existing construction projects financed by the corporation were completed in compared to commercial real estate loans increased in and in and  while demand for new loans was strong  lower interest rates and competition increased pay offs of existing loans 
the corporation s commercial real estate loans are generally made for owner use properties  carrying primarily floating or adjustable interest rates 
loans december in thousands consumer automobile      home equity  fixed and variable rate      revolving credit loans  including credit cards      other      real estate construction and land development      commercial mortgage 
     residential mortgage  excluding loans held for sale      other      commercial      loans  net of unearned income      investment securities the corporation has classified virtually all of its investment portfolio as held to maturity because it has both the ability and the intention to hold these securities to their stated maturity 
less than of the portfolio is classified as available for sale  either to provide additional liquidity in certain circumstances or because the special nature of the securities requires that they be classified as available for sale 
the corporation has constructed its portfolio in a laddered approach so an approximately equal amount matures each month 
this supplies liquidity to fund loan growth and provides for a natural hedge against changes in interest rates 
the corporation generally does not invest in mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  structured notes or other types of derivative securities 
the average outstanding held to maturity investment portfolio increased in to billion as deposits grew at a faster pace than loans and excess funds were placed temporarily in the investment portfolio 
in  average held to maturity securities decreased as a result of the need to fund loan growth and the acquisition of premier bankshares 
the corporation places primary importance on safety and liquidity in its investment portfolio 
accordingly  the majority of the portfolio is invested in us government and agency securities with maximum lives of approximately five years 
at the end of  the average term of these securities had increased by five months to months compared to the end of however  because of the callable nature of some of these securities  the actual duration of this portfolio is slightly less than months 
at december   us government and agency securities comprised of the securities portfolio compared to at the end of this percentage change reversed a trend since when changes in federal income tax laws reduced the tax benefits derived by banks for investments in municipal securities 
in  the collapse of russian and some asian bond markets precipitated a flight to high quality us treasury securities  which decreased the relative yield of these securities compared to municipal securities 
as a result  the corporation was able to purchase more high quality municipal securities at a spread over us treasury securities that met the corporation s investment criteria 
money market investments money market investments  consisting primarily of federal funds sold and securities repurchase agreements  are generally governed by the size of normally anticipated deposit swings and loan demand 
in  average money market investments increased to million  following a increase in the corporation maintained more of its funds in money market investments over the past two years as a decline in interest rates and a flat to inverted yield curve made these investments relatively more attractive 
deposits average deposits increased million or in  compared to a growth in during  the corporation acquired branch offices with approximately million in deposits and sold eight offices with approximately million in deposits  the remaining growth originated through existing offices 
the acquisition of all of the other major bank holding companies headquartered in virginia in late and provided excellent opportunities to obtain new customers who desired the personal attention and service offered by first virginia s super community banking approach 
in  much of the increase in deposits was a result of the acquisition of premier bankshares  and there was little internal growth as competition from nonbank intermediaries limited growth 
the growth in deposits in occurred in all deposit categories and was strongest in the lower cost transaction accounts 
average demand deposits increased in after increasing in the corporation offers a variety of accounts that appeal to different target groups 
the firstvantage plus account  which offers an attractive array of features to the high balance customer  was enhanced in and grew substantially 
other accounts appealing to the typical mid balance customer provide relationship linkage that avoids service charges 
the corporation s extensive branch office network creates a strong retail focus  resulting in a higher percentage of customers maintaining balances in transaction accounts compared to other banks 
in  of the corporation s average deposits were comprised of demand and interest checking accounts 
average deposits millions of dollars noninterest bearing    interest checking    savings    money market consumer cds    large denomination cds the corporation increased interest rates on its money market accounts in late  and the growth in these accounts was very strong throughout average money market accounts increased in after posting modest growth of in the preceding two years 
consumer savings increased slightly in after posting modest declines in the preceding three years  providing further evidence of the corporation s convenient branches and personal service generating low cost deposits 
money market and consumer savings comprised of the corporation s total deposits 
consumer certificates of deposit increased in to billion and comprised of total deposits 
internal growth was slightly negative the past two years so most of the growth in was a result of the acquisition of branches in maryland and virginia s eastern shore and the growth in was from the premier acquisition 
the strength of the stock market and the growth in mutual funds have reduced some of the attractiveness of certificates of deposit as an investment vehicle at this time 
large denomination certificates of deposit increased in  however  most of these funds come from the corporation s core consumer customers and pay interest at the same rate as other consumer certificates of deposit 
state and political  and negotiated rate jumbo certificates  which are traditionally considered to be a more volatile and costly source of funds  were unchanged from to most of the purchasers of these certificates maintain other deposit or lending relationships with the corporation 
the corporation does not purchase brokered deposits nor does it solicit deposits outside of its primary market areas 
maturity ranges for certificates of deposit with balances of  or more on december   were in thousands one month or less  after one month through three months  after three through six months  after six through twelve months  over twelve months  total  other interest bearing liabilities short term borrowings consist primarily of securities sold by the member banks with an agreement to repurchase them on the following business day and commercial paper issued by the parent company 
these short term obligations are issued principally as a convenience to commercial customers in connection with the corporation s cash management services 
average short term borrowings from these sources increased in and in  reflecting the increase in the number of commercial customers using cash management services 
long term indebtedness is comprised of capitalized lease obligations on branch office facilities that are not subject to prepayment and on one equipment note for the purchase of the corporation s mainframe computer 
shareholders equity first virginia has historically been one of the most highly capitalized banking companies in the nation  a reflection of its principles of safety  income and growth  in that order 
the ratio of total capital to total assets declined basis points to in as a result of greater growth in assets  increased dividends to shareholders  and an active share repurchase program 
these factors contributed to a decline in total equity at the end of compared to of million to million while total assets increased 
in  the ratio of shareholders equity to total assets had increased basis points from the end of to  primarily as a result of the acquisition of premier bankshares 
these ratios are significantly higher than the capital to assets ratio maintained by banks in the corporation s peer group of to billion asset sized banks

return on total average equity the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group the tier leverage ratio declined basis points to in as a result of the same factors affecting the capital to assets ratio  it was also impacted by the acquisition of deposits from other banks at a premium 
this premium is classified as a deposit intangible and is subtracted from total capital for regulatory purposes in calculating risk based and leverage capital ratios 
each of the corporation s individual banks maintains capital ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and all qualify as well capitalized banks  allowing them the lowest fdic premium rate and freedom to operate without restrictions from regulatory bodies 
the board of directors has approved several plans to repurchase the corporation s common stock since  and the corporation has repurchased an average of million shares per year since under these programs 
the most recent program  approved by the board of directors in  authorized the purchase of million shares 
in  million shares were purchased under this program at a total cost of million 
an additional million shares may be purchased under this authorization  however  there is no specific time period over which these shares will be purchased 
in the course of its repurchase programs  the corporation has employed the use of equity put warrants and accelerated share repurchase contracts 
first virginia and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
the corporation exceeded the additional regulatory risk based capital requirements by wide margins  due both to its high level of capital and the conservative nature of its assets 
the tier risk based capital ratio declined basis points in to as a result of the growth in risk based assets and the decline in total equity 
in  the tier ratio declined basis points  caused primarily by a shift in risk based assets into loans and out of investment securities 
regulatory minimums of and  respectively  are exceeded by substantial margins 
asset quality the corporation has a number of policies  reviewed regularly by senior management  to ensure that the risk in lending and investment activities is minimal  while the profit is consistent with the exposure to risk 
each member bank s internal loan monitoring system also provides a detailed monthly report of production  delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans 
this careful monitoring has resulted in a consistent record of low delinquencies and charge offs  as well as few nonperforming loans in relation to the entire loan portfolio 
the corporation has no foreign or highly leveraged transaction loans  and loans are only made within the trade areas of the member banks or in adjacent states where the corporation maintains loan production offices generating high quality consumer installment loans 
loans are generally not participated with nor purchased from banks outside of the first virginia system 
in addition  participations between banks within the first virginia system must first be shared with the corporation s lead bank  where a second comprehensive loan review process is performed 
approximately of the corporation s loans are made to consumers and are normally secured by personal or real property 
first virginia has no significant concentrations of credit to a single industry or borrower  and its loans are spread throughout its market area 
the corporation s legal lending limit to any one borrower is approximately million  however  it generally limits its loans to any one borrower and related interests to million 
in special cases  the corporation may exceed its internal guideline 
one of the corporation s specialty loan areas is the automobile finance area  and loans are made to consumers  both directly in the member bank branches and indirectly through automobile dealerships 
roughly of the total loan portfolio is comprised of consumer automobile loans  but because loan amounts are relatively small and spread across many individual borrowers  the risk of any major charge offs is minimized 
the corporation s automobile loans consist primarily of the highest quality loans  commonly referred to in the industry as a and b quality loans 
these loans contain substantially fewer risk characteristics than lower quality c and d subprime loans and have lower delinquencies  charge offs and collection costs 
during periods of economic weakness  subprime loan categories generate very high delinquencies and charge offs  while the high quality loans the corporation specializes in experience only modestly higher delinquencies and charge offs 
the corporation also makes loans directly to high quality automobile dealers to finance their inventories 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets declined million in to million compared to million at the end of as a percentage of total loans and real estate acquired by foreclosure  nonperforming assets declined eight basis points to  its lowest historic level 
in  nonperforming assets had increased 
million over as a result of the acquisition of premier bankshares and the inclusion of their nonperforming assets 
however  as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed real estate  nonperforming assets declined four basis points in to 
compared to the end of the ratio of nonperforming assets has steadily declined since peaking in at and has consistently been much lower than the average for similar sized banks in the corporation s national and regional peer groups 
there were no concentrations of foreclosed real estate or nonaccruing loans in any specific geographic location or type of property  and the majority of nonperforming assets were comprised of smaller balance loans to consumers that are liquidated on a regular basis 
nonperforming assets ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group the table below shows the total of nonperforming assets at the end of each of the past five years

loans days past due      percentage of total loans 





loans past due days or more have increased steadily over the past five years and rose million to million at the end of this represented 
of outstanding loans  a four basis point increase compared to the end of most of the increase in and came from the inclusion of loans from premier bankshares  which had higher risk profiles and delinquency rates than loans traditionally originated by first virginia 
despite the increase  these levels of delinquencies are significantly below industry averages and reflect the high overall quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
a loan generally is classified as nonaccrual when full collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  when repossession  foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings are initiated  or when other legal actions are taken 
in the case of installment loans  a loan is placed in nonaccrual if payments are delinquent days  and for other loans  after payments are delinquent for days 
credit card loans are charged off if they are days past due 
if collateral on a loan is sufficient to ensure full collection of principal and interest  an exception to the general policy might be made 
loans are also placed in a nonaccruing status at any time prior to that indicated above if the corporation anticipates that interest or principal will not be collected 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties 
at the end of  loans of this type that are not included in the preceding table of nonperforming and past due loans amounted to approximately million 
the majority of these loans represent commercial or property related loans 
depending on changes in the economy and other future events  these loans and others not presently identified as problem loans could be reclassified as nonperforming loans in the future 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance 
due to the homogeneous nature of a large percentage of the corporation s outstanding loans  a significant portion of the allowance is not determined by individual loan reviews 
rather the adequacy of the allowance and related provision for loan losses are evaluated by management based on the value of underlying collateral  economic conditions and unique marketplace factors that might affect the collectibility of the loans 
as a result  these judgments involve an inherently higher degree of uncertainty 
historical results and loss experience may not reflect this risk to the extent it might currently exist 
for other portions of the corporation s loan portfolio  management assesses the adequacy of the allowance based on a review of individual loans and commitments where internal credit evaluations result in ratings that are below standards adopted and periodically updated by the corporation 
other risk factors taken into account include recent loss experience in specific portfolio segments  underwriting standards and changes in credit quality  and changes in volumes or concentrations of credit risk 
reserve coverage ratios the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group net charge off ratios the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group in the case of construction  commercial and commercial real estate loans  each loan is reviewed and rated at least annually  and trends in the total portfolio are examined for potential deterioration in overall quality 
each loan in excess of  is examined individually and a specific allocation determined if full collectibility is in doubt 
this component of the overall allowance is relatively small and totaled million at the end of  including 
million for loans classified as nonperforming 
these loans comprise of the total loan portfolio  and the allocated allowance for these loans represented approximately of the total allowance for loan losses 
the remainder of the allowance is a general reserve that is determined considering macro and micro economic conditions  past loss experience  the nature of credit and geographic concentration risks and collateral value inherent in the corporation s portfolio of direct and indirect auto lending  credit card and other consumer loans that are homogenous in nature and comprise over of the corporation s loan portfolio 
no specific allocation of the allowance is made for individual loans in these categories and they are evaluated as a common group with similar characteristics 
these loans tend to be for relatively short durations of two to seven years and are either unsecured or secured by automobiles or residential real estate and have fairly consistent charge off experience 
in  net charge offs were up one basis point to 
of average loans compared to  after increasing six basis points to 
in over the past ten years  the annual net charge off rate has averaged

liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates the primary functions of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time period 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of the corporation s loan and deposit customers 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation does not hedge its position with swaps  options or futures but instead maintains a highly liquid and short term position in substantially all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
one of the primary ways the corporation meets its liquidity needs is by scheduling the maturity of its investment securities so that approximately an equal amount will mature each month 
the weighted average life of the securities portfolio at the end of was months  a slight increase from the months at the end of because the corporation views its securities portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and safety  it does not necessarily react to changes in the yield curve in an attempt to enhance its yield 
accordingly  the average life of the portfolio remains relatively stable as the corporation maintains a constant approach to its portfolio and invests primarily in us government and agency securities with a life generally no greater than five years 
municipal securities are also generally limited to lives of no more than five years  but availability and other factors mean they are occasionally purchased in serial issues with longer lives 
a cash reserve consisting primarily of overnight investments is also maintained by the parent company to meet any contingencies and to provide additional capital  if needed  to the member banks 
most of the corporation s loans are fixed rate installment loans to consumers and mortgage loans with maturities longer than the deposits by which they are funded 
a degree of interest rate risk is incurred if the interest rate on deposits should rise before the loans mature 
however  the substantial liquidity provided by the monthly repayments on these loans can be reinvested at higher rates that largely reduce the interest rate risk 
home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates that are tied to the prime rate 
many of the loans not in the installment or mortgage categories have maturities of less than one year or have floating rates that may be adjusted periodically to reflect current market rates 
these loans are summarized in the following table 
between year and after or less years years total in thousands maturity ranges commercial  financial and other     construction and land development 
    total     floating rate loans commercial  financial  agricultural and other    construction and land development 
   total    first virginia s asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing the corporation s liquidity requirements and maximizing the corporation s net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
liquidity requirements are reviewed in detail for each of the corporation s individual banks  however  overall asset liability management is performed on a consolidated basis to achieve a consistent and coordinated approach 
one of the tools the corporation uses to determine its interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to examine the volume of interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the difference between the two is the interest sensitivity gap  and it indicates how future changes in interest rates may affect net interest income 
regardless of whether interest rates are expected to increase or decrease  the objective is to maintain a gap position that will minimize any changes in net interest income 
a negative gap exists when the corporation has more interest sensitive liabilities maturing within a certain time period than interest sensitive assets 
under this scenario  if interest rates were to increase it would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   the corporation was liability sensitive in the short term under six months by approximately of earning assets  which declines to in months 
technically  the corporation may reprice interest checking  savings and insured money markets at any time and  accordingly  they have been classified in the day sensitivity category in the accompanying table 
while these accounts have in the last two years been somewhat more subject to repricing than in prior years  the degree and frequency of movement is limited  and they are much less sensitive than contractually possible

x x x first virginia also uses simulation analysis to monitor and manage interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  changes in interest rates and volumes are used to test the sensitivity of first virginia s net interest income 
simulation analysis uses a more detailed version of the information shown in the table on pages and that includes adjustments for the expected timing and magnitude of changes in assets and liabilities 
these adjustments take into account that interest rates on individual asset and liability categories may change at a different pace from their contractual rate 
a large part of first virginia s loans and deposits come from its retail base  and they do not automatically reprice on a contractual basis in reaction to changes in interest rates 
while first virginia s liability sensitivity in the short term indicates that an increase in interest rates may negatively affect short term net interest income  management would likely take actions to minimize its exposure to negative results and within a relatively short period of time would make adjustments so that net interest income would not be materially impacted 
for example  despite wide changes in rates since  first virginia has maintained a net interest margin above every year and has been able to maintain adequate liquidity to provide for changes in loan and deposit demands 
using shock analysis of a hypothetical  immediate increase in all interest rates of basis points and comparing that to a stable interest rate environment over the next months indicates that net interest income would decrease by while an immediate and hypothetical decrease in rates of basis points would increase net interest income by 
such an immediate change in all rates would be highly unlikely in management s opinion 
the corporation s dynamic simulation modeling takes into account the effects such changes may have on overall economic activity  the reaction of individual categories of assets and liabilities  and the impact that different management actions may have on net interest income 
accordingly  first virginia has not experienced the volatility its interest sensitive gap position or shock analysis may indicate 
over time  or under stable interest rate conditions  net interest income will tend to be greater at higher interest rate levels 
this is due to the large proportion of low cost core deposits such as demand  interest checking  savings and money market accounts comprising the corporation s funding sources  which can be invested in relatively higher yielding loans and investments 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the corporation s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
first virginia began preparing its computer systems and applications for the year in this process involves modifying or replacing the corporation s affected hardware and software as well as ensuring that external service providers  significant vendors and large customers are taking the appropriate action to remedy their own year issues 
first virginia developed a five phase approach to resolve its year issues 
this approach involves the following phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
the awareness and assessment phases involve identifying the systems affected  analyzing the scope and magnitude of the problem  and developing an action plan to address each area affected 
management has identified systems as mission critical  which are defined as those systems that would severely impair operations or cause a significant loss of revenue if not remediated 
the systems include those maintained on the corporation s own computers as well as those systems processed by external service providers 
to date  first virginia has completed all aspects of the awareness and assessment phases 
the renovation phase involves modifying or replacing the corporation s affected systems 
of the systems identified as mission critical  have completed the renovation phase 
the final two phases  validation and implementation  involve testing and certification that the mission critical systems are compliant with all year issues and are completed 
the remainder of the mission critical systems are expected to be tested and certified by the end of march first virginia has contacted non mission critical external service providers  significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which they may be affected by year issues and to determine whether they are taking the appropriate steps to remedy their own year issues 
to date  first virginia is not aware of any external service providers  vendors or large customers whose failure to resolve their own year issues would have a material adverse effect on first virginia s results of operations 
however  the corporation has no means of ensuring that external agents or large customers will be ready and the effect of their noncompliance is not determinable 
the corporation will continue to monitor the progress of non mission critical external service providers  significant suppliers and large customers throughout and will determine if a contingency plan is necessary for those external parties by september  management of the corporation believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
the services of an independent third party have been engaged to review the corporation s plan and readiness for year mission critical issues 
in addition  the corporation s primary regulator  the federal reserve  conducts a quarterly examination and evaluation of the corporation s progress 
as noted above  all phases have not yet been completed 
in the event that first virginia is unable to complete all necessary phases of the plan  first virginia may be unable to process transactions  invoice customers or collect payments and perform other operations 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the corporation 
the corporation has developed contingency plans for of its mission critical systems and is developing plans for the remaining systems that will be completed by june  these plans involve  among other actions  manual work arounds  temporary postponement of certain functions and alternative computer systems 
some of these plans incorporate parts of the corporation s existing disaster recovery programs involving offsite data processing and detailed plans for each function within the corporation 
first virginia estimates that the total cumulative cost of the project will be approximately million of which million has already been expended 
this includes both internal and external personnel costs related to modifying the systems and the cost of purchasing or leasing hardware or software 
purchased hardware and software will be capitalized in accordance with normal policy 
personnel and all other costs related to the project are being expensed as incurred 
these costs are not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
the cost of the project and the expected completion dates are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that could influence the results may include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the availability of alternative systems in the event of failure of mission critical systems  the ability of third party intermediaries to be year ready  and similar uncertainties

although the corporation believes that its expectations with respect to the forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results  performance or achievements of the corporation will not differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
quarterly results the results of operations for the first three quarters of have been analyzed in quarterly reports to shareholders 
the results of operations for each of the quarters during the two years ended december   are summarized in the table on pages and the results of operations for the fourth quarter are highlighted below 
earnings per share in the fourth quarter rose to a record 
compared to 
earned in the prior year s quarter 
net income rose to million compared to million earned in the fourth quarter of a lower number of outstanding shares  a direct result of the corporation s share repurchase program  caused diluted earnings per share to increase at the faster pace 
the return on assets during the fourth quarter was compared to the earned in the prior year  while the return on equity was compared to in the prior year s fourth quarter 
total assets at the end of were billion  an increase of compared to the billion at the end of loans grew at an annualized rate of increase of over the end of the third quarter 
all categories of loans increased with loans to automobile dealers to finance inventory rising a seasonally strong unannualized over the third quarter and automobile loans to consumers rising at a annualized pace over the third quarter 
the net interest margin declined basis points to compared to the prior year s fourth quarter of and was down from the achieved in the third quarter 
during the last four months of the year there were three quarter point drops in the prime rate and reductions in interest rates in general  the result of the international bond crisis  which caused yields on the corporation s earning assets to decline at a faster pace than the cost of funds 
noninterest income increased in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter 
a one time gain of million was recorded on the sale of million in credit card loans that were required to be sold by the bank s affinity card partner 
excluding the nonrecurring gain  noninterest income was up 
during the quarter  a customer value based approach to service charges was implemented  resulting in a increase in service charges on deposits 
insurance activities were also strong with insurance premiums and commissions up 
electronic banking income rose during the quarter as atm and pos income increased and the corporation s pc based home banking products increased in popularity 
noninterest expense declined slightly compared to the third quarter and was up over the prior year s fourth quarter 
the prior year s noninterest expense had included a million charge for stock related employee compensation as performance targets for the vesting of certain stock options were met 
total shareholders equity increased slightly to 
billion at december   compared to 
billion at the end of september  but was down slightly compared to the billion at the end of during the fourth quarter of   shares were purchased under the company s share repurchase program
