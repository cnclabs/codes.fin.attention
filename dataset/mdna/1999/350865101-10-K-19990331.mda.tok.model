year compliance overview the year issue is primarily the result of computer programs only accepting a two digit date code  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
beginning in the year  and in certain instances prior to the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  the company s date critical functions may be adversely affected unless these computer systems and software products are  or become  able to accept four digit entries 
internal systems and equipment the company has commenced a comprehensive program consisting of identifying  assessing and if necessary  upgrading and or replacing its systems and equipment that may be vulnerable to year problems 
the first stage of this program  identifying the systems and equipment  has been substantially completed 
the company has prioritized the identified items as either critical or non critical to the operations of the company 
the company has made substantial progress through the second and third stages of this program  assessing and upgrading and or replacing the equipment it has deemed to be non compliant 
the company is also in the beginning stage of developing a plan to test its entire system for year compliance 
the company believes that it will have completed all of its necessary upgrades and or replacements and the testing of its systems by june  third party relationships the company has begun to formally communicate with its significant suppliers and customers to determine if those parties have appropriate plans to remedy year issues when their systems may impact the operations of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that the systems of other companies on which the company s processes rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to successfully convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have an impact on the company s operations 
the company believes that by june it will substantially complete its assessment of the status of its significant customers and suppliers compliance with the year issues 
contingency plans based on the assessment effort to date  the company has focused on three separate contingency plans if the company s systems are non compliant if the company s customers are non compliant and if the company s suppliers are non compliant 
the company is in the early stages of developing these plans and believes that it will be able to fully determine its worst case scenarios by june there can be no assurance that the company will be able to have a contingency plan in place for a significant supplier and or customer that does not become year compliant 
costs risks management currently estimates that the cost  in connection with bringing its own systems and equipment into compliance  will be less than  for fiscal and does not expect the additional cost to exceed  although the company is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurance that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the necessary systems and changes to address the year potential sources of risk include but are not limited to the inability of principal clients and licensees to be year compliant  which could result in delays in product deliveries from such clients and licensees  the inability of the company s clients and licensees to become compliant  which could impact their ability to sell product or report royalties in a timely manner resulting in a disruption of the company s cash flow  and disruption of television broadcast signals  including satellite distribution and commercial integration vendors as a result of the general failure of systems and necessary infrastructure such as electrical supply
