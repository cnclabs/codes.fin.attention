overview sales increased by million from  principally as a result of the acquisition of ruco on july   and of the ocean wash garment processing businesses in april  as well as the inclusion of a full year of sales of ivax acquired in july 
operating income for the year was million  a decrease of 
million as the textile chemicals specialties business experienced a reduction in operating income of million  while the new polymer intermediates segment created by the ruco acquisition added million and environmental products and services decreased slightly 
million 
the company s earnings per share  on a fully diluted basis  before an extraordinary item  was  
lower than the acquisition of ruco was part of the company s strategic initiative to develop a third line of business 
ruco operates in a growth market in which the company s basic strengths in adding value to our customers businesses can be extended 
the acquisition of the ocean wash garment processing chemicals business complements the ivax acquisition 
ocean wash added approximately million in sales for the nine months it was included in operations 
operations compared to the textile chemical specialties segment sales for increased over this increase resulted primarily from the ocean wash and ivax acquisitions  which more than offset the continued soft conditions in the north american textile market where the company had reduced sales of million  and the unfavorable impact of a style change in the garment sector  from light colored denim to dark colors  which requires less of the company s enzyme products that create the stone washed effect 
europe s textile chemical sales for the year improved in us dollars  mostly due to increased sales in distributor countries 
the europe physical volume improvement of was offset by the negative effect of the continued stronger us dollar versus the dutch guilder for us based organic chemicals sales volume decreased by approximately due to expiring toll manufacturing contracts which were not renewed or replaced 
the newly formed polymer intermediates segment had sales of million for the five months it was part of the company  which was approximately above ruco s results for the comparable pre acquisition period in that increase was mainly a result of physical volume growth as prices declined by slightly more than 
sales in the environmental product and services segment for decreased due  in part  to the sale of the reverse osmosis membranes business in december the ongoing operations in this segment showed a decline of versus this segment was negatively impacted in by the continued weak ion exchange industrial and household markets conditions in both the us and far east  with volume dropping 
those decreases were partially offset by improvements in the toner  specialty polymer and biochemical product lines 
the overall gross margin for was versus for in the textile chemical specialties segment  margin of was percentage points below the prior year level of 
margins for north america asia were percentage points below  primarily due to the impact of the additional sales of the ocean wash products which carry overall lower margins  an approximate drop in average us selling prices  somewhat offset by lower raw material and fixed manufacturing costs 
margins in europe remained steady from year to year 
organic margins were affected by the reduced volume without a corresponding decrease in fixed manufacturing costs 
gross margin for the polymer intermediate segment  at  is much lower than margins for the company s other segments  and was comparable to ruco s pre acquisition performance 
the lower gross profit margin is more than offset by lower operating expenses  producing very favorable operating income as discussed below 
the gross margin in the environmental products and services segment for increased to versus for overall  the period was positively impacted by the results of several strategic action plans which were set in motion in  including i the entry into a ten year supply agreement pursuant to which dow chemical company dow will provide the company with substantially all of the company s anion exchange resin requirements  ii the switch from purchasing a major raw material in the polymer product line to manufacturing in house  and iii the aforementioned divestiture of the reverse osmosis membrane business which carried substantially lower margins 
in addition  in  the biochemical product line showed improved margins due to increased volume and a favorable product customer mix in france 
operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased percentage points to in  due to the lower operating cost of the polymer intermediates business offsetting increased operating costs as a percentage of sales over in the company s other segments 
while sales volumes increased overall in the textile chemical specialties segment  operating expenses grew at a higher rate and  as a percentage of sales  increased primarily due to the added costs for the ocean wash and ivax acquisitions  higher legal expenses in the us and increased administration and computer related costs in europe 
the lower sales volume caused the environmental products and services segment expenses as a percent of sales to increase over the same period in despite a reduction of actual expenses 
the company s provision for income taxes was computed using applicable prevailing income tax rates 
sybron s effective tax rate of for was essentially equivalent to s rate of 
other income expense was million for versus million last year 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in interest expense of million associated with the acquisition of ruco and the refinancing of the company s debt 
this was offset by a favorable currency adjustment difference between the two years of million 
this currency impact primarily resulted from the korean won strengthening against the us dollar  reversing part of the loss experienced in also in the company recorded expenses of million related to the terminated merger transaction 
compared to sales for improved over led by the textile chemical specialties segment  which grew 
sales in the environmental products and services segment increased in compared with the prior year 
the growth in the textile chemical specialties segment resulted primarily from combined north america and asia textile chemical sales which increased over this was the result of the initial five months of sales from the acquisition in late july of the garment processing and textile chemical business from ivax industries  strong growth in mexico  taiwan  korea and canada  new product introduction and market expansion in several southern states  and increased custom toll manufacturing in the related organics business 
these more than offset the continued weakness in the us textile markets 
sales in europe improved in compared to in terms of us dollars 
this resulted from a substantial physical quantity increase of due to geographic market expansion and new product sales  which more than overcame an overall average selling price decrease and a net negative currency impact of approximately primarily related to the stronger us dollar versus the dutch guilder 
the three major product lines in the environmental products and services segment all showed modest improvements in over the prior year 
the increase in the ion exchange product line was primarily a result of new and regained customers and an overall volume increase in the household resin market 
the full year impact of the acquisition of chemical images in june and new toner business contributed to the improvement in the specialty polymer product line 
the biochemical product line increase in was due to substantial improvements in europe primarily in consumer  marine  industrial and municipal applications  and increased usage in the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater in the us  all somewhat offset by a downturn in the consumer product line in the us overall average selling prices in this segment were relatively flat in versus the prior year 
the gross margin for was  a substantial improvement over the experienced the prior year 
gross margins in the textile chemicals specialties segment increased to in versus the rate of 
margins in the north america and asia markets improved to in from the prior year s due to new product sales which command a higher margin  the elimination of several low margin products in the us  a slight decrease in raw material costs  substantial sales increases in mexico which carry higher margins  and additional cost controls 
in the organics chemical business  margins also improved in compared to primarily as the result of the increase in higher margin toll manufacturing 
the margins in europe increased to in from in this improvement was due to the continued favorable impact of a weaker dutch guilder as compared with certain other european currencies  coupled with new product sales that carry higher margins 
year to year improvements in all the product lines in the environmental products and services segment resulted in a gross margin of for this segment in  as compared to in in  margins in the ion exchange product line were impacted by lower raw material costs  production related efficiencies and improved fixed cost controls 
these offset a slight decrease in average selling prices and higher freight costs 
costs for styrene  the major raw material  remained stable 
production efficiencies and improved cost controls helped improve the margins in the specialty polymers product line 
biochemical margins increased in compared to due to an overall average selling price increase  production efficiencies and a favorable product customer mix 
operating expenses as a percent of sales were in  unchanged from the textile chemical specialties segment expenses as a percent of sales in decreased to from in  primarily the result of favorable impacts from europe due to the dutch guilder dollar exchange rate and lower environmental costs 
operating expenses as a percent of sales in the environmental products and services segment increased to from the prior year 
this was primarily the result of increased legal accruals primarily in the ion exchange product line  higher provisions for doubtful accounts in specialty polymers  and overall stepped up marketing efforts in several of the segment s product lines 
the company s provision for income taxes was computed using applicable prevailing income tax rates 
the company s effective tax rate of for was only slightly higher than the rate of 
other income expense was million for versus million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to million in costs associated with the terminated merger agreement transaction coupled with 
million in foreign exchange losses related to the devaluation of asian currencies  primarily the korean won 
environmental matters the manufacture of the company s products  and in some cases their storage  transportation and disposal  involve a number of environmental considerations 
see item environmental matters and note commitments and contingencies  to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
during  and the company incurred approximately   and  respectively  of costs in connection with the ongoing review of possible soil and ground water contamination at its birmingham  new jersey facility 
these expenditures have been treated as land improvements 
during   and the company spent approximately   and  respectively  to identify and remediate certain soil contamination at its facility in ede  holland which existed at the time the company acquired this facility from sybron corporation 
approximately   and  of the costs incurred in  and  respectively  were charged against amounts previously reserved 
the cost of remediating contamination at the company s existing facilities is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s annual operating results  cash flow or financial condition 
at december   the company has accrued approximately  to offset future environmental assessment and remediation costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  were million below the december  balance of million  primarily as a result of the company s use of cashin connection with acquisitions 
operating activities generated a net cash flow of million for versus million in this was primarily the result of a substantial reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the return to the taxing authorities of an erroneous tax refund in the netherlands  executive bonus payouts for  annual pension funding  and payments for the previously discussed terminated merger agreement 
in addition  unusually high inventory and capital equipment purchased during the latter part of were paid for in net cash flow generated by operating activities totaled million for versus million for the same period in this increase principally was due to increased net income and higher payable balances  including a million tax refund paid in error by the netherlands government 
this refund was returned to the taxing authorities early in higher accounts receivable and inventory balances due to increased business activity were the principal uses of operating cash 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million for as compared with million for the comparable period 
the year to year increase was primarily the result of the ruco and ocean wash acquisitions  coupled with the purchase of property adjacent to the manufacturing site in ede  holland that will be used for future expansion 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million for as compared with million for this increase was the result of the ivax acquisition in july  coupled with higher capital expenditures in due to manufacturing plant upgrades in the us and mexico 
financing activities provided million in net cash during versus million in  due primarily to the new credit facility the new credit facility the company entered into in connection with the acquisition of ruco 
on july   the company obtained from dlj capital funding  inc  morgan guaranty trust company of new york and mellon bank na the million new credit facility 
the new credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility which replaces the company s previous revolving credit facility and a million six year term loan facility the term loan facility consisting of a tranche a facility for million and a tranche b facility for million 
the term loan facility was used to finance the million acquisition of ruco  refinance certain indebtedness of the company  and pay fees and expenses 
at december   the revolving credit facility was undrawn 
borrowings under the tranche a and b facilities and the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to a margin  based on the leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries  at the company s option over either a base rate or adjusted libor 
the company has chosen to borrow at libor plus the leveraged margin of 
the revolving credit facility  which matures on july   provides that million may be used for letters of credit and up to million may be used as a swing line facility 
the term loan facility will be amortized over a six year period 
the company s obligations under the new credit facility are guaranteed by each of the company s present and future domestic subsidiaries the loan guarantors 
the new credit facility and the guarantees thereof are secured by substantially all assets of the company and the loan guarantors and a pledge of all of the capital stock of the company s domestic subsidiaries and of the voting capital stock of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the net cash provided by financing activities for was million primarily due to funding the ivax acquisition versus a million net cash usage for during  the company believes its capital expenditures for existing operations  which are expected to be slightly above s  can be funded from operating cash flow 
management believes cash flow from operations and available credit will be sufficient to finance operations  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
foreign exchange the company has subsidiaries in europe  asia  africa and the americas and  for all subsidiaries  except the company s mexican and colombian subsidiaries  the company has determined the functional currencies are the subsidiaries local currencies 
the company s mexican and colombian subsidiaries functional currency is considered to be the us dollar because both countries are designated as highly inflationary economies 
the company has a large manufacturing facility in ede  holland where chemicals are manufactured and sold either directly to customers or to various subsidiaries  which are principally in europe 
intercompany balances arise between the dutch operation and various subsidiaries 
overall  the company recognized an exchange gain of million  an exchange loss of million in  and an exchange gain of million in year readiness disclosure many currently installed computer systems are not capable of distinguishing st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than nine months  computer systems and or software used by many companies in a wide variety of applications will experience operating difficulties unless they are modified or upgraded to adequately process information involving  related to or dependent upon the century change 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the scope and magnitude of problems associated with the century change 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year yk software failures and has established a project team to address yk risks 
the project team has and will continue to coordinate the identification of and implementation of changes to computer hardware and software applications that will attempt to ensure availability and integrity of the company s information systems and the reliability of its operational systems and manufacturing processes 
the company has also assessed the potential overall impact of the impending century change on its business  results of operations and financial position 
the company has reviewed its information and operational systems and manufacturing and laboratory processes to identify those services or systems that are not yk compliant 
as a result of this review  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace certain information and operational systems so they will be yk compliant 
these modifications and replacements are being  and will continue to be  made in conjunction with the company s overall systems initiates 
the total cost of these yk compliance activities  estimated at less than  has not been  and is not anticipated to be  material to the company s financial position or its results of operations 
the company expects to complete its yk project  including testing  during based on available information  the company does not believe any material exposure to significant business interruption exists as a result of yk compliance issues 
accordingly  the company has not adopted any formal contingency plan in the event its yk project is not completed in a timely manner 
the costs and the timing in which the company plans to complete its yk modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will timely identify and remediate all significant yk problems  that remedial efforts will not involve significant time and expense  or that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial position 
the company also faces risk to the extent that suppliers of products  services and systems and others with whom the company transacts business on a worldwide basis do not comply with yk requirements 
the company has initiated formal communications with significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to these third parties failure to remediate their own yk issues 
in the event any such third parties cannot provide the company with products  services  or systems that meet the yk requirements on a timely basis  or in the event yk issues prevent such third parties from timely delivery of products or services required by the company  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
to the extent yk issues cause significant delays in  or cancellation of  decisions to purchase the company s products or services  the company s business  results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
inflations and trends united states average selling prices in the us decreased by approximately during overall raw material costs remained flat 
the cost of styrene  one of the major raw materials in the environmental products and services segment  declined approximately in versus the prior year 
europe average selling prices and raw material costs in the europe division s textile chemical product line were essentially flat in in the textile chemical specialties segment  the company is focusing on increasing market penetration in existing major markets such as the us and europe and growing developing markets in latin america  asia  eastern europe and the middle east 
the company will continue new product development including more environmentally friendly alternatives to existing products 
growth opportunities in the environmental product and services segment include further penetration into the toner and laser printer markets  increased share of the us and export ion exchange markets  and expansion of the biochemical waste treatment and consumer institutional business in the us and europe 
in addition  the company continues to actively pursue niche acquisitions that  together with synergies gained with the existing businesses  would provide both top and bottom line growth and accretive earnings per share
