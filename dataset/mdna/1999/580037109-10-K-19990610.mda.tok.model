item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general revenues of the marine construction services segment are largely a function of the level of oil and gas development activity in the world s major hydrocarbon producing regions 
consequently  revenues reflect the variability associated with the timing of significant development projects 
as a result of continuing lower oil prices  marine construction services customers have significantly reduced capital expenditures for exploration and production spending  and backlog has declined over  since the beginning of the fiscal year 
at the current backlog level  management expects revenues in fiscal year to be as much as forty percent lower than in the current fiscal year  and profitability to be lower because of the volume decline 
economic and political instability in asia have also had an adverse effect on the timing of exploration and production spending 
revenues of the power generation systems segment are largely a function of capital spending by the electric power generation industry 
in the electric power generation industry  persistent economic growth in the united states has brought the supply of electricity into approximate balance with energy demand  except at periods of peak demand 
however  electric power producers have generally chosen to meet these peaks with new combustion turbines rather than with base load capacity 
new emissions requirements have also prompted some customers to place orders for environmental equipment 
demand for electrical power generation industry services and replacement nuclear steam generators continues at strong levels 
international markets remain unsettled  and economic and political instability in asia have caused projects in these emerging markets to be delayed  suspended or cancelled 
in the process industry  demand for services remains strong  and the pulp and paper industry has begun to issue inquiries relating to the refurbishment or replacement of existing recovery boilers 
management expects the fiscal year operating activity of this segment to be about the same as in the current fiscal year 
revenues of the government operations segment are largely a function of capital spending by the us government 
management does not expect this segment to experience any significant growth because of reductions in the defense budget over the past several years  however  management expects the segment to remain relatively constant since it is the sole source provider of nuclear fuel assemblies and nuclear reactor components to the us government 
management expects the fiscal year operating activity of this segment to be about the same as in the current fiscal year 
revenues of industrial operations are affected by variations in the business cycles in the customers industries and the overall economy 
legislative issues such as environmental regulations and fluctuations in us government funding patterns also affect industrial operations 
backlog for industrial operations has improved significantly from a year ago  primarily because of significant new contracts in engineering and construction 
management expects the fiscal year operating activity of this segment to be about the same as in the current fiscal year 
in general  all of mcdermott s business segments are capital intensive businesses that rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of their revenues 
a significant portion of mcdermott s revenues and operating results are derived from its foreign operations 
as a result  mcdermott s operations and financial results are affected by international factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
mcdermott attempts to minimize its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates by matching foreign currency contract receipts with like foreign currency disbursements 
to the extent that it is unable to match the foreign currency receipts and disbursements related to its contracts  mcdermott enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on operating results 
statements made herein which express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those that are not historical fact  are forward looking 
they involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include 
decisions about offshore developments to be made by oil and gas companies  
the deregulation of the us energy market  
governmental regulation and the continued funding of mcdermott s contracts with us government agencies  
estimates for pending and future non employee asbestos claims  
the highly competitive nature of mcdermott s businesses  
operating risks associated with the marine construction services business  
economic and political conditions in asia  
the results of the ongoing investigation by mii and jrm and the us department of justice into possible anti competitive practices by mii and jrm  and related civil lawsuits  and 
the results of the ongoing sec investigation into whether mcdermott may have violated us securities laws in connection with such anti competitive practices and other matters

the provision for benefit from income taxes decreased  from a provision of  to a benefit of  while income before provision for benefit from income taxes and extraordinary item decreased  to  the decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily the result of a benefit of  recorded as a result of the decrease in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes  favorable tax settlements totaling  of prior years disputed items in various jurisdictions and a decrease in income 
mcdermott operates in many different tax jurisdictions 
within these jurisdictions  tax provisions vary because of nominal rates  allowability of deductions  credits and other benefits  and tax bases for example  revenues versus income 
these variances  along with variances in the mix of income within jurisdictions  are responsible for shifts in the effective tax rate 
fiscal year vs fiscal year marine construction services revenues increased  to  primarily due to higher volume in virtually all activities in all operating areas  except in offshore activities in the far east  engineering activities in the middle east and engineering and procurement activities in europe and west africa 
segment operating income increased  to  virtually all activities in all operating areas  except the far east and engineering  reflected this increase 
gain loss on asset disposals and impairments net decreased  from a gain of  to a loss of  primarily due to the impairment loss of  relating to goodwill associated with the acquisition of opi

power generation systems revenues increased  to  primarily due to higher revenues from fabrication and erection of fossil fuel steam and environmental control systems  plant enhancement projects  boiler cleaning equipment  and engineering  procurement and construction of cogeneration plants 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues from replacement nuclear steam generators 
segment operating income loss increased  from a loss of  to income of  primarily due to higher volume and margins from fabrication and erection of fossil fuel steam and environmental control systems  plant enhancement projects  boiler cleaning equipment and engineering  procurement and construction of cogeneration plants 
in addition  there were higher margins from replacement nuclear steam generators and replacement parts and lower selling and general and administrative expenses 
loss on asset disposals and impairments net decreased  to  primarily due to the write down of an equity investment in a domestic cogeneration joint venture and an asset impairment loss on a domestic manufacturing facility in the prior year 
income loss from investees increased  from a loss of  to income of  this represents the results of approximately twelve joint ventures 
the increase is primarily due to the favorable operating results from three foreign joint ventures and a provision for a loss on a canadian joint venture in the prior year 
this increase was partially offset by a favorable termination agreement of a domestic joint venture in the prior year 
government operations revenues decreased  to  primarily due to lower revenues from nuclear fuel assemblies and reactor components for the us government  commercial nuclear environmental services and other government related operations 
these decreases were partially offset by higher revenues from management and operation contracts for us government owned facilities

these variances  along with variances in the mix of income within jurisdictions  are responsible for shifts in the effective rate 
effect of inflation and changing prices mcdermott s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  using historical dollar accounting historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on its operations  mcdermott attempts to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimate of such changes  which is reflected in the original price  or through price escalation clauses in its contracts 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year  mcdermott s cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  and total debt decreased  to  primarily due to a reduction in short term borrowings of  and repayment of  in long term debt 
during this period  mcdermott provided cash of  from operating activities  and received cash proceeds of  from the net sales and maturities of investments  and  from asset disposals  including  from the termination of the mcdermott etpm joint venture 
mcdermott used cash of  for the acquisition of preferred and common stock   for additions to property  plant and equipment and  for dividends on mii s common and preferred stock 
pursuant to agreements with the majority of its principal insurers  mcdermott negotiates and settles products liability asbestos claims from non employees and bills these amounts to the appropriate insurers 
reimbursement of such claims is subject to varying insurance limits based upon the year involved 
moreover  as a result of collection delays inherent in this process and the effect of agreed payment schedules with specific insurers  reimbursement is usually delayed for three months or more 
the average amount of these claims historical average of approximately  per claim over the last three years has continued to rise 
claims paid during the fiscal year ended march  were  of which  has been recovered or is due from insurers 
at march   receivables of  were due from insurers for reimbursement of settled claims 
of the  due from insurers   had been included in the pool of qualified receivables sold pursuant to a receivables purchase and sale agreement see below 
the collection delays  and the amount of claims paid for which insurance recovery is not probable  have not had a material adverse effect upon mcdermott s liquidity 
at march   the estimated liability for pending and future non employee products liability asbestos claims was  and estimated insurance recoveries were  management s expectation is that new claims will conclude within the next thirteen years  that there will be a significant decline in new claims received after four years  and that the average cost per claim will continue to increase only moderately 
mcdermott s estimates of future asbestos products liability and probable insurance recoveries are based on prior history and management s best estimate of cost based on all available information 
however  future costs to settle claims  as well as the number of claims  could be adversely affected by changes in judicial rulings and influences beyond mcdermott s control 
accordingly  changes in the estimates of future asbestos products liability and insurance recoverables and differences between the proportion of any additional asbestos products liabilities covered by insurance  and that experienced in the past could result in material adjustments to the results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year  and the ultimate loss may differ materially from amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment increased  to  in fiscal year the majority of fiscal year expenditures were to maintain  replace and upgrade existing facilities and equipment 
mcdermott has budgeted capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal at march   mcdermott had  in secured borrowings pursuant to a receivables purchase and sale agreement between b w and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries and a us bank 
through july    was repaid under the agreement 
effective july   the receivables purchase and sale agreement was amended and restated to provide for  among other things  the inclusion of certain insurance recoverables in the pool of qualified accounts receivable 
it also provided for sales treatment as opposed to secured financing treatment for this arrangement under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
as a result   was removed from notes payable and current maturities of long term debt on the balance sheet 
this amended and restated agreement was terminated on april  on may   mii and jrm entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which mii initiated a tender offer for those shares of jrm that it did not already own for per share in cash 
under the merger agreement  any shares not purchased in the tender offer will be acquired for the same price in cash in a second step merger 
mii estimates that it will require approximately  to consummate the tender offer and second step merger and to pay related fees and expenses 
mii expects to obtain the funds from cash on hand and from a new  senior secured term loan facility with citibank  na the facility will terminate and all borrowings thereunder will mature upon the earlier of five business days after the consummation of the second merger or september  when the facility terminates  jrm will declare and pay a dividend and or loan to mii such amounts that  together with mii s available cash  will be used to repay all outstanding loans under the facility 
citibank  na may act either as sole lender under the facility or syndicate all or a portion of the facility to a group of financial institutions 
the facility contains customary representations  warranties  covenants and events of default 
the facility also includes financial covenants that 
require mii to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of not less than  
limit mii s ability to pay dividends  and  
require mii  jrm and certain other subsidiaries to maintain cash  cash equivalents and investments in debt securities of at least  at all times 
the facility is secured by a first priority pledge of all jrm capital stock and securities convertible into jrm capital stock held by or acquired by mii or any of its subsidiaries 
at march   mcdermott had total cash  cash equivalents and investments of  mcdermott s investment portfolio consists primarily of government obligations and other investments in debt securities 
the fair value of short and long term investments at march  was  at march   approximately  fair value of these obligations were pledged to secure a letter of credit in connection with certain reinsurance agreements 
management anticipates that approximately  of this investment portfolio will be used to fund the tender offer  second step merger and related fees and expenses referred to above 
at march  and  mcdermott had available various uncommitted short term lines of credit from banks totaling  and  respectively 
borrowings against these lines of credit at march  were  there were no borrowings against these lines at march  at march   b w was a party to a revolving credit facility under which there were no borrowings 
in july  b w terminated its existing credit facility and  jointly and severally with bwico and bwxt  entered into a new  three year  unsecured credit agreement the bwico credit agreement with a group of banks 
borrowings by the three companies against the bwico credit agreement cannot exceed an aggregate amount of  the remaining  is reserved for the issuance of letters of credit 
in connection with satisfying a condition to borrowing or issuing letters of credit under the bwico credit agreement  mi made a  capital contribution to bwico in august at march   there were no borrowings under the bwico credit agreement 
at march   jrm and certain of its subsidiaries were parties to a revolving credit facility under which there were no borrowings 
in june  jrm and such subsidiaries entered into a new  three year  unsecured credit agreement the jrm credit agreement with a group of banks 
borrowings against the jrm credit agreement cannot exceed  the remaining  is reserved for the issuance of letters of credit 
at march   there were no borrowings under the jrm credit agreement 
management does not anticipate jrm will need to borrow funds under the jrm credit agreement during fiscal year subsequent to year end  jrm elected to reduce the commitments on the jrm credit agreement from  to  mi and jrm are restricted  as a result of covenants in debt instruments  in their ability to transfer funds to mii and certain of its subsidiaries through cash dividends or through unsecured loans or investments 
at march   substantially all of the net assets of mi were subject to such restrictions 
at march   jrm could make unsecured loans to or investments in mii of approximately  and pay dividends to mii of approximately  in connection with the tender offer and merger described above  an amendment to the jrm credit agreement was entered into that permits jrm to loan to mii such amounts as may be required for mii to repay the amounts outstanding under the  senior secured term loan facility with citibank na on march   jrm consummated an offer to purchase all of its outstanding senior subordinated notes at a purchase price of of their principal amount  per  principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on that date  jrm purchased  in principal amount of the notes for a total purchase price of  including interest of  as a result  jrm recorded an extraordinary loss of  in connection with the purchase of the notes  jrm received consents to certain amendments that amended or eliminated certain restrictive covenants and other provisions contained in the indenture relating to the notes 
specifically  the covenants contained in the indenture that restricted jrm s ability to pay dividends  repurchase or redeem its capital stock  or to transfer funds through unsecured loans to or investments in mii were eliminated 
working capital decreased  from  at march  to  at march  during the next fiscal year  mcdermott s management expects to obtain funds to meet capital expenditure  working capital and debt maturity requirements from operating activities  cash and cash equivalents  and short term borrowings 
leasing agreements for equipment  which are short term in nature  are not expected to impact mcdermott s liquidity or capital resources 
jrm s joint ventures are largely financed through their own resources  including  in some cases  stand alone borrowing arrangements 
in some instances  mcdermott provides guarantees on behalf of its joint ventures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at march   the ratio of long term debt to total stockholders equity was as compared with at march  on april   mii called all of the outstanding shares of its series c cumulative convertible preferred stock for redemption on april  at the close of business on the redemption date  all  preferred shares then outstanding were converted into  common shares 
on july   mi redeemed all of its  outstanding shares of series b cumulative preferred stock for  plus in accrued but unpaid dividends  per share 
mii made a  capital contribution to mi to cover the cost of the redemption 
on september   mi redeemed  of its outstanding shares of series a cumulative convertible preferred stock series a preferred stock for  plus in accrued but unpaid dividends  per share 
the remaining  outstanding shares of its series a preferred stock were converted into mii common stock at a conversion ratio of one share of mii common stock  plus  for each preferred share 
mii made a  capital contribution to mi to cover the cost of the redemption and conversion 
mii s quarterly dividends are per share on its common stock 
prior to redemption  mi s quarterly dividends were per share on the series a cumulative convertible preferred stock and per share on the series b cumulative preferred stock 
during fiscal year  mii s board of directors approved the repurchase of up to two million shares of its common stock from time to time on the open market or through negotiated transactions  depending on the availability of cash and market conditions 
the purpose of the repurchases was to offset dilution created by the issuance of shares pursuant to mii s stock compensation and thrift plans

jrm repurchased another  shares of its common stock at an average share price of through october   at which time jrm ceased all further share repurchases 
at such time  jrm had repurchased  of the three million shares of its common stock authorized to be repurchased 
at march   mii has provided a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of  which cannot be realized through carrybacks and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
management believes that remaining deferred tax assets are realizable through carrybacks and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and  if necessary  the implementation of tax planning strategies involving sales of appreciated assets 
uncertainties that affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets are the risk of incurring losses in the future and the possibility of declines in value of appreciated assets involved in identified tax planning strategies 
these factors have been considered in determining the valuation allowance 
management will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
impact of the year the mcdermott company wide year project is proceeding on schedule 
the project addresses information technology components hardware and software in internal business systems and infrastructure and the embedded systems in offices  plants and products delivered to customers 
in addition  an analysis of critical suppliers is being performed to ensure the supply of materials and services that are strategic to business continuity 
the year project began company wide with a planning phase during the latter part of followed by a company wide assessment  which was completed in early based upon the results of the assessment and the diverse nature of mcdermott s product lines  strategies for business systems were developed that fit the requirements of each of the mcdermott business units 
some entities are replacing legacy systems with commercial enterprise systems  others are employing a combination of proprietary and third party client server systems  while a third strategy is based primarily upon remediation of legacy applications 
embedded systems and the critical supplier analysis are being addressed with a common methodology across mcdermott 
a consistent work breakdown structure for the project is being employed throughout mcdermott 
business applications and it infrastructure it systems 
facilities office buildings 
embedded systems in plants and construction equipment 
customer products embedded systems in customer products 
critical suppliers the general phases of the project common to all of the above functions are establish priorities  inventory items with potential year impact  assess and create a solution strategy for those items determined to be material to mcdermott  implement solutions defined for those items assessed to have year impact  and test and validate solutions 
at march   the inventory  prioritization and assessment of the critical it systems components were complete 
the remediation and replacement tasks are in progress with approximately of the work completed 
the facilities and embedded systems phases of the project were complete and on schedule with testing and replacement of components showing significant progress during the quarter 
the analysis of critical suppliers includes the determination of the compliance status of the suppliers businesses as well as the products they produce 
the majority of the company sites have completed this analysis and the balance are near completion 
the customer products phase of the project is essentially complete with minor work outstanding at a few of the company s smaller business units 
all year solutions for the critical it systems  facilities and embedded systems that support mcdermott s engineering  manufacturing and construction operations and the corporate functions are scheduled to be substantially completed by june  the analysis and the compliance tasks for customer products and critical suppliers are on schedule and are forecast to be completed by june  as an alternative to the remediation of the legacy payroll systems  mcdermott has elected to outsource its payroll function 
the transition to the payroll service provider will be completed by october  mcdermott does not expect that the cost associated with the modifications to critical systems and other compliance activities will have a material impact on its consolidated financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
the cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost   is attributable to the purchase of hardware and software  which will be capitalized  and the remaining  will be expensed as incurred 
expenditures to date include  of capital and  of expense 
the differences between the cost incurred to date and the project completion percentage is due to certain project milestones with subcontractors for work being performed for the corporate office 
excluding the corporate office  approximately of the total anticipated year project cost has been incurred through march  mcdermott s year compliance is also dependent upon the year readiness of external agents and third party suppliers on a timely basis 
the failure of mcdermott or its agents or suppliers to achieve year compliance could result in  among other things  plant production interruptions  delays in the delivery of products  delays in construction completions  delays in the receipt of supplies  invoice and collection errors  and inaccurate inventories 
these consequences could have a material adverse impact on mcdermott s results of operations  financial condition and cash flow if it is unable to conduct its businesses in the ordinary course 
mcdermott is taking steps to mitigate the risk of a material impact of year on its operations with the development of contingency plans 
these plans focus on the mission critical processes and third party dependencies that could be at risk with the century date change 
contingency plans are in the early stages of development and are being prioritized consistent with the requirements of each operating location 
all contingency planning activities are scheduled to be completed by september  although mcdermott is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on its results of operations  mcdermott believes that its year project  including contingency plans  should significantly reduce the adverse effect that any such disruptions may have 
statements made herein which express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those which are not historical fact  are forward looking 
they involve a number of risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements 
the dates on which mcdermott believes the year project will be completed are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the year project 
specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to 
the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  
the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  
timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  
the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced  and  
similar uncertainties 
the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem results in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties and the interconnection of global businesses 
due to this general uncertainty  mcdermott cannot ensure its ability to timely and cost effectively resolve problems associated with the year issue that may affect its operations and business or expose it to third party liability 
new accounting standards in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sop provides guidance on accounting for the costs of start up activities and requires that entities expense start up costs and organization costs as they are incurred
