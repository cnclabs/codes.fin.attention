the company is unable to quantify the potential impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on its financial position and results of operations 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its business 
year compliance many computer systems and applications use a two digit field to designate a year rather than a four digit field 
this can result in these systems and applications recognizing the use of as either the year or some other year as opposed to the year yk 
such failure to recognize the correct year could result in system failures and miscalculations that could adversely impact the ability of a company to do business the yk issue 
the company has commenced a review of the yk issue and has separated its review into five categories 
these categories are i internally developed software and information technology it systems for sale or internal use  ii it systems and software associated with the company s content management and other manufacturing processes  iii financial and other administrative it systems  iv non it systems  and v customer and vendor it systems 
internally developed software and it systems the company s digital link software is used in certain of its prepress manufacturing processes and also provides a source of revenue for the company through the sale of software licenses and systems that incorporate digital link 
the company has performed a preliminary review and testing of the digital link software with respect to yk compliance 
the company believes that all of the internally developed components of digital link are yk compliant 
the operating system on which digital link runs is yk compliant 
the database that digital link utilizes is not currently yk compliant  however  the vendor has made available the necessary modifications to make the database yk compliant 
the company has not yet obtained the released modifications from the vendor 
the company intends to perform additional intensive testing of the digital link software and to complete its review of such software by the end of the second quarter of in the event any yk issue is discovered during the testing period  the company believes that any such issue can be resolved by replacing the non compliant components with yk compliant components or through programming modifications 
the company has not reviewed whether the equipment on which digital link runs at customer locations or other customer systems with which digital link operates is yk compliant 
failure of the company s customers to achieve yk compliance on such equipment and systems could result in the loss of future revenue to the company 
manufacturing processes the company has implemented a plan to review its prepress manufacturing processes and the equipment and software used in such processes 
the company s prepress manufacturing process is heavily dependent on macintosh systems  which are yk compliant 
the company has either received certificates from certain of its vendors regarding yk compliance or is relying on certificates posted to websites by vendors indicating the state of yk readiness of such vendors 
all vendors reviewed to date have indicated that they are either yk compliant or have commenced action necessary to become yk compliant 
the company has also been installing yk compliant equipment and software as older  non compliant items are retired 
to date  all mission critical systems have been tested and no yk related issues have been identified in the prepress manufacturing processes 
as part of its plan  the company is in the process of identifying  categorizing  and assessing all of its manufacturing process equipment and software  which the company expects to complete in the second quarter of the company plans to replace or repair any non compliant systems identified in its review by the middle of the third quarter of by the end of the third quarter of  the company intends to achieve yk compliance or have adequate contingency plans in place 
the company is not responsible for the printing of customers material  except for certain limited print work done in its los angeles facility and other print work subcontracted to an affiliate 
however  the company makes use of direct to plate delivery to certain printers selected by its customers 
the company s ability to continue to use direct to plate delivery may be contingent on the printers equipment being yk compliant 
certain of these printers use equipment supplied by the company that is yk compliant 
in the event that a printer s equipment is not yk compliant and is unable to accept direct to plate delivery  the company could deliver film to such printer 
however  irrespective of how the company delivers its product to the printer  the ability of the printer to deliver the finished product to the customer is contingent on the printer s manufacturing process not being adversely impacted by the yk issue 
the company s business could be adversely impacted if printers manufacturing processes are not yk compliant  and therefore unable to produce finished product  or if customers  as a result  order fewer prepress services or delay orders until an alternative printer whose manufacturing process is yk compliant is located 
the company does not currently intend to review the yk compliance status of printers 
the company has commenced a review of the publishing manufacturing process acquired in the devon merger 
based on the review of such process performed prior to the merger  the company believes that the primary systems are yk compliant 
the company is in the process of identifying any systems that are non compliant and has initiated an effort to make the necessary programming changes during the company is currently reviewing the yk issues involving the broadcast media distribution manufacturing process 
the company has identified non compliant systems at its wilmington  oh  facility that will be replaced with either new systems or existing compliant systems in service at the company s other broadcast services facilities 
there can be no assurance that the review being performed by the company will not uncover additional non yk compliant equipment and systems 
failure to attain yk compliance on such non compliant equipment and systems  if any  may have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the broadcast media distribution business 
financial and other administrative it systems the company is currently replacing the various modules that comprise its financial and administrative systems that are not yk compliant 
the company implemented new yk compliant versions of both its general ledger and accounts payable systems during the third quarter of at all of its operations  except at those operations acquired as part of the acquisition of color control and the merger with devon 
the company plans to implement the remaining modules by the end of the third quarter of the company does not anticipate any delays in the implementation of these financial and administrative systems 
the company plans to complete the implementation of the various financial and administrative modules at color control and the prepress operations at devon during the fourth quarter of the company is also replacing the financial and administrative systems used in the publishing business with different yk compliant systems than those being installed at all other operations 
the company expects such systems to be implemented by the end of the second quarter of the company also plans to replace its job costing and billing systems at those locations that have non yk compliant systems 
the company is currently in the process of selecting a vendor to use for its job costing system 
certain operations currently use job costing systems that are yk compliant 
failure to implement a new system at those locations using a non yk compliant system may adversely impact the company s ability to properly bill a customer for the actual work performed on specific jobs and to properly manage costs at these locations 
in the event the company cannot implement a yk compliant job costing system at these locations  the company plans to rely on processes that are not electronically integrated to provide the necessary information 
although certain operations currently have yk compliant billing systems  the company is planning on implementing an enterprise wide billing solution as part of the implementation of a yk compliant job costing system 
in the event the company is unable to implement such billing system  the company plans to implement the yk compliant billing module it purchased as part of the above referenced financial and administrative systems so that the company does not experience a break or delay in its ability to invoice customers 
non it systems the company has not reviewed its non it systems  which would involve an assessment of the myriad of day to day functions that may be controlled or enhanced by some type of microprocessor 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a disruption in the company s ability to do business because of a yk problem encountered with one of these systems 
customer and vendor it systems the company has commenced a review of its customers and vendors systems by soliciting responses to questionnaires sent to such customers and vendors 
non yk compliant customer systems may inhibit the ability of customers to process and pay the company s invoices or to continue to provide business to the company 
non yk compliant vendor systems may inhibit the ability of vendors to provide the goods and services necessary for the company to continue to perform its business 
although the company would seek to receive such goods and services from those vendors who can provide them without interruption caused by yk issues  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to locate vendors that can provide the goods and services in a timely manner and at a similar cost 
the company will fund the costs of attaining yk compliance through working capital or borrowings under the credit agreement 
the company is unable at this time to estimate the costs of attaining yk compliance or the potential impact of yk issues on its future results of operations 
the company has not deferred and does not intend to defer any systems related projects due to the work necessary to achieve yk compliance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk 
the company had  outstanding under the credit agreement at december  interest rates on funds borrowed under the credit agreement vary based on changes to the prime rate or libor 
the company partially manages its interest rate risk through three interest rate swap agreements under which the company pays a fixed rate and is paid a floating rate based on the three month libor rate 
the notional amounts of the three interest rate swaps totaled  at december  a change in interest rates of would result in a change in income before taxes of  based on the outstanding balance under the credit agreement and the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements at december
