item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of which involve risks and uncertainties 
downey s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  economic conditions  competition in the geographic and business areas in which downey conducts its operations  fluctuations in interest rates  credit quality and government regulation 
for additional information concerning these factors  see item business factors that may affect future results on page overview net income for totaled a record million or per share on a diluted basis  up from last year s million or per share 
net income in benefited by million from the settlement of litigation regarding obligations of a prior joint venture partner settlement 
the pre tax amount totaled million of which million represented the recovery of a prior loan charge off thereby reducing provision for loan losses  million was recorded in income from real estate and joint venture operations of which million was a reduction of loss  million was recorded in miscellaneous other income  and million was recorded as a reduction to professional fees within general and administrative expense 
excluding that amount  net income would have been million or per share on a diluted basis  up from a year ago 
excluding the settlement  the increase in net income primarily reflected higher net interest income 
net interest income increased million or due to increases in both average earning assets and the effective interest spread 
also contributing to the increase in net income between years was an adjusted million increase in other income and declines of million and million in adjusted provision for loan losses and net operation of real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans  respectively 
the increase in other income reflected several factors 
favorably impacting other income were increases of million in loan and deposit related fees  million in net gains on sales of loans  and million in adjusted income from real estate held for investment 
these favorable other income items were partially offset by declines of million in the all other category  as included a gain from the sale of an asset obtained as part of the acquisition of butterfield savings  and a million decline in loan servicing fees primarily due to additions made to the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights 
the favorable impact of higher net interest and other income  and lower provision for loan losses and cost of net operation of real estate acquired in settlement of loans was partially offset by higher general and administrative expense 
the million adjusted increase in general and administrative expense reflected significantly higher lending volumes  branch expansion and expense related to resolving year compliance issues 
assets increased million or during to billion at year end  following a increase during asset growth slowed in even though loan originations reached a record level  as the low interest rate environment prevalent during the year resulted in a high level of loan prepayments as borrowers refinanced into low  fixed rate loans 
single family loan originations increased from billion in to billion in  of which billion were originated for sale in the secondary market 
in addition to single family loans  million of other loans were originated  including million of auto loans and million of construction and land loans

deposits totaled billion at december   up from year end non performing assets totaled million or of assets at december   down from million or of assets at december  the decline in non performing assets was primarily in the commercial real estate loan category  as several loans were returned to accrual status following an extended period of satisfactory payment performance 
a detailed review of all criticized  classified  watch and non performing assets is performed at least semi annually 
all assets greater than million are reviewed annually 
the combined provisions for loan and real estate losses  including real estate held for investment and acquired in settlement of loans  resulted in a million reduction of expense for  primarily due to the aforementioned settlement  which included million of settlement proceeds as a reduction to the provision for losses 
excluding this item  the combined provisions would have been million in  million in and million in at december   the bank met and exceeded all three regulatory capital tests  with capital to asset ratios of in tangible and core capital and in risk based capital 
these capital levels are well above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal banking regulators of for core and tangible capital and for risk based capital

net interest income is affected principally by the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and by the relative dollar amounts of such assets and liabilities 
net interest income was million in  up million or from and million or greater than the improvement over primarily reflected increases in both average earning assets and the effective interest rate spread 
average earning assets increased by million or to billion

the table also sets forth the net interest income  the interest rate spread and the effective interest rate spread 
the effective interest rate spread  which reflects a savings association s relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities  equals i the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  ii divided by average interest earning assets for the period

net interest income increased million or due to increases in both average earning assets and the effective interest rate spread 
also contributing to the increase in net income between years was an adjusted million decline in provision for loan losses and an adjusted million increase in other income 
the increase in adjusted other income reflected increases in loan and deposit related fees and net gains on sales of loans  partially offset by a decline in loan servicing fees and that results included a gain from the sale of an asset obtained as part of the acquisition of butterfield savings 
the favorable impact of these items were partially offset by higher operating expense

loan originations including loans purchased totaled a record billion in  up from billion in and billion in this increase primarily reflected an increase in originations of one to four unit residential loans

in arm transactions for which no origination fees are charged  downey receives a larger margin over the index to which the loan pricing is tied than in those in which fees are charged 
in addition  such loans are generally subject to a prepayment fee if prepaid within the first three years 
this trend towards loans with no origination fees has generally resulted in deferrable loan origination costs exceeding loan origination fees except in  which included increases in interest buydowns  or discounts  on new real estate loans

dsl service company has ten wholly owned retail neighborhood shopping centers located in california and arizona 
the following table sets forth the condensed balance sheets of dsl service company s joint ventures by property type at december   on a historical cost basis 
included in the following condensed balance sheet are allowances for losses recorded by dsl service company 
these allowances are determined quarterly by means of downey s internal asset review process 
see problem loans and real estate allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page to the extent the fair market value of the real estate assets is less than the carrying value  then a provision is made to create a valuation allowance for the difference 
if such a valuation allowance is needed  it is reflected in the investment accounts for the joint ventures on dsl service company s books

the aggregate other partners deficit of million represents their equity interest in the accumulated retained earnings deficit of the respective joint ventures 
those results include not only the net profit on sales and the operating results of the real estate assets  but depreciation expense and funding costs as well 
except for any secured financing which has been obtained  dsl service company has provided all other financing 
as part of downey s internal asset review process  the fair value of the joint venture real estate assets is compared to the secured notes payable to the bank and others and dsl service company s equity investment 
to the extent the fair value of the real estate assets is less than the aggregate of those amounts  a provision is made to create a valuation allowance 
those allowances totaled million at december  at december   the fair value of the real estate assets of certain joint venture partnerships in which the other partners equity was a deficit exceeded the amount of third party notes and dsl service company s investment thereby eliminating the need for a valuation allowance since the sale of the real estate would allow dsl service company to realize its investment 
thus  the other partners deficit of million exceeds the amount of valuation allowances established of million

the following table sets forth the associated maturities at december  in thousands thereafter  total intermediate and long term fhlb advances  asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
downey s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk in its lending and deposit taking activities 
this interest rate risk occurs to the degree that interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more rapidly or on a different basis than interest earning assets 
since downey s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  a principal objective of downey is to actively monitor and manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on net interest income while maintaining asset quality 
downey s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk management policy which sets forth limits established by the board of directors on acceptable changes in net interest income and net portfolio value npv from specified changes in interest rates 
npv is defined by the ots as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
alco reviews  among other items  economic conditions  the interest rate outlook  the demand for loans  the availability of deposits and borrowings  and downey s current operating results  liquidity  capital and interest rate exposure 
in addition  alco monitors asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and performs various simulations and other analyzes to determine the potential impact of various business strategies in controlling interest rate risk and the potential impact of those strategies upon future earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
based on such reviews  alco formulates a strategy that is intended to implement the objectives set forth in downey s business plan without exceeding the net interest income and npv limits set forth in the interest rate risk policy 
one measure of downey s exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of downey s major asset and liability categories as of december   as well as certain information regarding the repricing and maturity difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities gap in future periods 
the repricing frequencies have been determined by reference to projected maturities  based upon contractual maturities as adjusted for scheduled repayments and repricing mechanisms provisions for changes in the interest and dividend rates of assets and liabilities 
prepayment rates are assumed on substantially all of downey s loan portfolio based upon its historical loan prepayment experience and anticipated future prepayments 
repricing mechanisms on certain of downey s assets are subject to limitations  such as caps on the amount that interest rates and payments on downey s loans may adjust  and accordingly  such assets do not normally respond as completely or rapidly as downey s liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rate sensitivity of downey s assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differed from the assumptions set forth

downey s six month gap at december   was a positive ie  more interest earning assets reprice within six months than interest bearing liabilities 
this compares to a positive six month gap of and at december  and  respectively 
downey s primary strategy to manage interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination of arms or loans with relatively short maturities 
interest rates on arms are primarily tied to the cmt or cofi 
during  and  downey originated and purchased approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  of loans and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates or maturities of five years or less  representing approximately  and  respectively  of all loans and mortgage backed securities originated and purchased for investment during such periods 
arm originations during those three years were primarily tied to cofi rather than the cmt index 
at december   of downey s interest earning assets mature  reprice or are estimated to prepay within five years  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
at december   loans held for investment with adjustable interest rates represented of downey s loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
during  downey will continue to offer residential fixed rate loan products to its customers to meet customer demand 
fixed rate loans are primarily originated for sale in the secondary market and are priced accordingly in order to create loan servicing income and to increase opportunities for originating arms 
however  downey may originate fixed rate loans for investment when funded with long term funds to mitigate interest rate risk  and small volumes to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure or that meet certain yield and other approved guidelines 
see business banking activities lending activities secondary marketing and loan servicing activities on page downey is better protected against rising interest rates with a positive six month gap 
however  downey remains subject to possible interest rate spread compression  which would adversely impact downey s net interest income if interest rates rise 
this is primarily due to the lag in the repricing of the indices to which downey s adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are tied  as well as the repricing frequencies and periodic interest rate caps on such adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities 
the amount of such interest rate spread compression would depend upon the frequency and severity of such interest rate fluctuations 
the positive six month gap could decrease in future periods due to  among other things  the continued expansion of the auto and consumer loan portfolios 
in addition to measuring interest rate risk via a gap analysis  downey establishes limits on  and measures the sensitivity of  its net interest income and npv to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
downey utilizes an internally maintained asset liability management simulation model to make the calculations which  for npv  is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
first  downey estimates its net interest income for the next twelve months and the current npv assuming no change in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  calculations are made for each of the defined changes in interest rates  to include any associated differences in the anticipated prepayment speed of loans 
those results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income and npv due to the changes in interest rates 
the following are the estimated impacts to net interest income and npv from various instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rates based upon downey s asset and liability structure as of year ends and since these estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  such as the expected maturities of downey s interest bearing assets and liabilities and the shape of the period end interest rate yield curve  downey s actual sensitivity to interest rate changes could vary significantly if actual experience differs from those assumptions used in making the calculations 
percentage change in percentage change in change in interest rates net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio in basis points income value income value the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents the npv of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the npv in the various rate scenarios 
the following table shows downey s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  this data differs from that in the gap table as it does not incorporate the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
rather  it only reflects contractual maturities adjusted for anticipated prepayments

the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on downey s historical experience 
downey s average constant prepayment rate cpr is and on its fixed rate and arm portfolios  respectively  for interest earning assets excluding investment securities  which do not have prepayment features 
for deposit liabilities  in accordance with standard industry practice and downey s own historical experience  decay factors  used to estimate deposit runoff  of per year have been applied 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the downey s historical experience

problem loans and real estate non performing assets non performing assets consist of loans on which downey has ceased the accrual of interest non accrual loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
non performing assets totaled million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  the decrease in non performing assets was primarily attributed to several loans in the commercial real estate loan category that were returned to accrual status following an extended period of satisfactory payment performance 
the effective yield on these loans bear a market rate of interest and are  therefore  not considered troubled debt restructurings 
of the total  real estate acquired in settlement of loans  net of allowances  represented million at december   down from million at december   and million at december the following table summarizes the non performing assets of downey at the dates indicated

all such assets were sold to the fdic s division of resolution in december allowance for loan losses does not include the allowance for real estate and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
it is downey s policy to take appropriate  timely and aggressive action when necessary to resolve non performing assets 
when resolving problem loans  it is downey s policy to determine collectibility under various circumstances which will result in maximum financial benefit to downey 
this is accomplished by either working with the borrower to bring the loan current or by foreclosing and selling the asset 
downey performs ongoing reviews of loans that display weaknesses and maintains adequate loss allowances on the loans 
for a discussion on downey s internal asset review policy  refer to allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page all of downey s non performing assets at december   were located in california 
downey evaluates the need for appraisals for non performing assets on a periodic basis 
a new appraisal will generally be obtained when downey believes that there may have been an adverse change in the property operations or in the economic conditions of the geographic market of the property securing its loans 
downey s policy is to obtain new appraisals at least annually for major real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
throughout  downey obtained new appraisals for non performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
non accrual loans 
it is downey s general policy to account for a loan as non accrual when the loan becomes days delinquent or when collection of interest appears doubtful 
in certain cases  loans may remain on accrual status past days when it is determined that continued accrual is warranted because the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
as of december   downey had no loans days or more delinquent which remained on accrual status 
any interest previously accrued with respect to non accrual loans is reversed and charged against interest income 
interest income is recognized on non accrual loans to the extent that payments are received and to the extent that downey believes it will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
such loans are restored to an accrual status only if all past due payments are made by the borrower and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest 
at december   non accrual loans aggregating million were less than days delinquent relative to their contractual terms 
additional loans aggregating million were not contractually past due  but were deemed non accrual due to management s assessment of the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans 
downey considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable that downey will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are carried at either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or the net fair value of the collateral securing the loan 
impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
for downey  loans collectively reviewed for impairment include all single family loans and performing multi family and non residential loans having principal balances of less than million 
in determining impairment  downey considers large non homogeneous loans with the following characteristics non accrual loans  debt restructurings  and performing loans which exhibit  among other characteristics  high loan to value ratios or delinquent taxes 
downey bases the measurement of collateral dependent impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral 
non collateral dependent loans are valued based on a present value calculation of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective rate 
cash receipts on impaired loans not performing according to contractual terms are generally used to reduce the carrying value of the loan  unless downey believes it will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to provision for loan losses 
adjustments to impairment losses due to changes in the fair value of the collateral of impaired loans are included in provision for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan  loss of principal is recorded through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized totaled million  compared to million at december  the total allowance for losses related to such loans was million at december   and for further information regarding impaired loans  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page troubled debt restructurings 
a restructuring of a debt is considered a troubled debt restructuring when downey  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise grant 
troubled debt restructurings may include changing repayment terms  reducing the stated interest rate and reducing the amounts of principal and or interest due or extending the maturity date 
the restructuring of a loan is intended to recover as much of downey s investment as possible and to achieve the highest yield possible 
there were no troubled debt restructurings on accrual status at december  and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
real estate acquired in settlement of loans consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosure 
delinquent loans when a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  downey normally records a notice of default  subject to any required prior notice to the borrower  and commences foreclosure proceedings 
if the loan is not reinstated within the time permitted by law for reinstatement  which is normally five business days prior to the date set for the non judicial trustee s sale  the property may then be sold at a foreclosure sale 
if downey has elected to pursue a non judicial foreclosure  downey is not permitted under applicable california law to obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower  even if the security property is insufficient to cover the balance owed 
in foreclosure sales  downey generally acquires title to the property

downey commenced one to four units subprime lending in the first quarter of allowance for losses on loans and real estate valuation allowances for losses on loans and real estate are established on a specific and general basis 
specific allowances are determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its net fair value 
general valuation allowances are determined based on historical loss experience  current and anticipated levels and trends of delinquent and non performing loans and the economic environment in downey s market areas 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page downey s internal asset review department conducts independent reviews to evaluate the risk and quality of all downey assets 
downey s internal asset review committee iarc is responsible for the review and classification of assets 
the iarc members include the chief internal asset review officer  chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  general counsel  director of compliance risk management  credit administrator and chief appraiser 
the iarc meets quarterly to review and to determine asset classifications and to recommend any changes to asset valuation allowances 
with the exception of payoffs or asset sales  the classification of an asset  once established  can be removed or upgraded only upon approval of the iarc 
the chief internal asset review officer reports quarterly to the audit committee of the board of directors regarding overall asset quality  the adequacy of valuation allowances on classified assets and downey s adherence to policies and procedures regarding asset classification and valuation 
downey adheres to an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of problem assets and adequate general valuation allowances to cover asset losses 
downey s current asset monitoring process includes the use of asset classifications to segregate the assets  largely loans and real estate  into various risk categories 
downey uses the various asset classifications as a means of measuring risk for determining the general valuation allowances at a point in time 
downey currently uses a six grade system to classify its assets 
the current grades are pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard  doubtful and loss assets are considered classified assets for regulatory purposes 
a brief description of these classifications follows o the pass classification represents a level of credit quality which contains no well defined deficiency or weakness 
o the watch classification is used to identify an asset that currently contains no well defined deficiency or weakness  but it is determined to be desirable to closely monitor the asset eg  loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this category may also be used for assets upgraded from lower classifications where continuing monitoring is deemed appropriate 
o a special mention asset does not currently expose downey to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification  but does possess a correctable deficiency or potential weakness deserving management s close attention 
o substandard assets have a well defined weakness or weaknesses 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that downey will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
o an asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
downey considers doubtful to be a temporary classification until resolution of pending weakness issues enables downey to more clearly define the potential for loss 
o that portion of an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as an asset  without establishment of a specific valuation allowance  is not warranted 
a loss classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value  but rather it is not reasonable to defer writing off or providing for all or a portion of an impaired asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future 
downey will generally classify as loss the balance of the asset that is greater than the net fair value of the asset unless payment from another source can be expected 
therefore  the amount of an asset classified as loss reflects the total of specific valuation allowances established for the particular asset 
specific valuation allowances are not includable in determining the bank s total regulatory capital 
the ots has the authority to require downey to change its asset classifications 
if such a change results in an asset being classified in whole or in part as loss  a specific allowance must be established against the amount so classified or that amount must be charged off 
ots guidelines set forth quantitative benchmarks as a starting point for the determination of appropriate levels of general valuation allowances 
the ots directs its examiners to rely on management s estimates of adequate general valuation allowances if the association s process for determining adequate allowances is deemed to be sound 
it is downey s policy to provide an allowance for losses on loans and real estate when it is probable that the value of the asset has been impaired and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
to comply with this policy  downey has established a monitoring system that requires at least an annual review of all assets in excess of million and a semiannual review of all assets considered adversely classified or criticized 
the monitoring system requires a review of current operating statements  an evaluation of the property s current and past performance  an evaluation of the borrower s ability to repay and the preparation of a discounted cash flow analysis 
based on the results of the review  a new appraisal may be required 
downey s provision for loan losses totaled million in  down million from net loan charge offs exceeded the provision for loan losses by million resulting in a decrease in the allowance for loan losses to million at december  this decrease reflects an improvement in overall loan quality 
included in the current year end allowance was million of general valuation allowances of which million was unallocated to any specific loan category 
a summary of activity in the allowances for loan losses is set forth below for the years indicated

the decline primarily reflected a million decline in net charge offs of one to four unit residential loans and a million recovery of a prior commercial real estate loan charge off due to proceeds from the previously mentioned settlement

the provision reductions in all years presented were due to a continuing improvement in the real estate market which favorably impacted the valuation of certain neighborhood retail shopping center investments and to a reduction in the investment in certain joint venture investments

repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and deposit inflows and outflows are affected significantly by interest rates  real estate sales activity and general economic conditions 
loan repayments increased billion in to billion and were virtually equal to new loan originations and purchases for portfolio 
in  new loan originations and purchases for portfolio exceeded repayments by billion 
during  aggregate borrowings increased million as downey took advantage of obtaining long term advances from the fhlb at attractive borrowing rates to fund fixed rate loans for investment 
downey also experienced a net deposit inflow of million  of which million represented transaction accounts partially offset by a million decrease in certificates of deposit 
to the extent deposit growth falls short of satisfying ongoing commitments to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits  repay borrowings  fund existing and future loan and other investment commitments  continue branch improvement programs and maintenance of regulatory liquidity requirements  downey will utilize borrowing arrangements with the fhlb and other sources 
at december   downey had commitments to fund loans amounting to million  loans in process of million  undrawn lines of credit of million  and letters of credit and other contingent liabilities of million 
downey believes its current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining its liquidity at appropriate levels 
the principal measure of liquidity in the savings and loan industry is the regulatory ratio of cash and eligible investments to the sum of withdrawable savings and borrowings due within one year 
the minimum liquidity ratio set by federal regulators was reduced in from to 
at december   the bank s ratio was compared to and at december  and  respectively

current accounting issue in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
under sfas  an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
as part of its secondary marketing activities  downey utilizes forward sale and purchase contracts to hedge the value of loans originated for sale against adverse changes in interest rates 
at december   such sales and purchase contracts amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
these contracts have a high correlation to the price movement of the loans being hedged 
there is no recognition of unrealized gains and losses on these contracts in the balance sheet or statement of income 
when the related loans are sold  the deferred gains or losses from these contracts are recognized in the statement of income as a component of net gains or losses on sales of loans and mortgage backed securities 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  it is not anticipated that the financial impact of this statement will have a material impact on downey 
year risks of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to represent the calendar year eg  for 
software so developed  and not corrected  could produce inaccurate or unpredictable results or system failures commencing january   when dates present a lower two digit year number than dates in the prior century 
such occurrences may have a material adverse effect on downey s financial condition  results of operation  business or business prospects  as downey  like most financial organizations  is significantly subject to the potential impact of the year issue due to the nature of financial information 
potential impacts to downey may arise from software  computer hardware  and other equipment both within downey s direct control and outside downey s ownership  yet with which downey electronically or operationally interfaces 
financial institution regulators have intensively focused upon year exposures  issuing guidance concerning the responsibilities of management and the board of directors 
year testing and certification is being addressed as a key safety and soundness issue in conjunction with regulatory exams and the ots has authority to bring enforcement actions against any institution under its supervision which it believes is not properly addressing year compliance issues 
state of readiness downey has established a four phase process to address the year issue 
in addition  downey s board of directors oversees the year compliance project s progress through monthly status reports and quarterly reviews with the year project manager 
as part of the first phase  which is now completed  downey inventoried of all data systems to determine which are most critical to support customer transaction processing and provide customer services 
this inventory not only included in house systems  but those provided by third party vendors as well 
systems were prioritized as being mission critical  high risk  moderate risk or low risk  from which modification plans were developed which place priority emphasis on those systems requiring change and classified mission critical or high risk 
third party vendors were contacted during this phase to determine their process and timeline in correcting any year compliance issues 
in addition  commercial loan borrowers of downey were also contacted to determine the extent of their preparations for year and any potential impact year may have on their businesses and ability to repay loan obligations to downey 
commercial lending does not represent a significant portion of downey s loan portfolio ie  approximately  therefore  downey believes the year preparedness of its commercial loan borrowers does not pose a significant risk 
phase two of the process consists of making appropriate year programming changes to downey s in house systems  while phase three consists of acceptance testing and sign off of both downey s in house and vendor provided systems 
the fourth and final phase of the year compliance project includes installation of the system modifications into downey s daily operation 
the fourth phase is scheduled to occur once a system has been successfully tested and determined to be year compliant 
in addition to phase one  phase two has been completed and phase three has begun with respect to downey s in house mainframe system  which performs all significant loan  deposit and general ledger accounting processes 
it is expected that acceptance testing of the in house mainframe system will be finalized and installation completed by the end of first quarter for downey developed pc based systems classified mission critical  all programming changes and acceptance testing have been completed 
completion of programming and acceptance testing of all other downey developed pc based systems is expected to be completed by the end of second quarter  as is the installation of year modifications 
the timing of year acceptance testing and installation of all third party vendor changes is dependent upon when such systems become available to downey 
downey has in place a process to monitor third party vendor progress in making required year corrections and  when completed  requires third party vendors to represent that their systems are year compliant 
although such vendor representations are requested  downey does not intend to rely solely upon them 
rather  downey intends to test such vendor programs or review testing conducted by others for year compliance 
in addition to the computer systems utilized by downey  downey has also inventoried other essential services that may be impacted by year issues such as telecommunications and utilities 
downey is monitoring such essential service providers to determine their progress and how they are addressing year issues 
to date  no information exists to suggest such essential services will not be year compliant 
costs to address the year issue currently downey estimates that year project costs will approximate million 
this cost is in addition to existing personnel who are working on the year compliance project and includes estimates for hardware and software renovation or replacement  as well as additions to existing staff who will be specifically devoted to the project 
approximately of the year compliance project cost represents costs to migrate to a new personal computer environment and to replace certain older automated teller machines  both of which downey might otherwise have implemented or replaced during the period notwithstanding the year issue 
as such  that portion of year costs will be amortized over the useful life of the equipment 
of the estimated total expense  approximately million has been incurred to date  million in and million in the table below summarizes by year the estimated amount and anticipated timing of the planned year expense 
in millions thereafter total estimated year expense as downey progresses in addressing the year compliance project and additional information becomes available  estimates of costs could change 
at this time  no significant data system projects have been delayed as a result of downey s year compliance effort 
contingency plans downey believes its year compliance project should enable it to be successful in modifying its computer systems to be year compliant 
as previously stated  acceptance testing and installation with respect to downey s in house mainframe system which performs all significant loan  deposit and general ledger accounting processes is expected to be completed by the end of first quarter in addition to year compliance system modification plans  downey has also developed contingency plans for all other systems classified as mission critical and high risk 
these contingency plans provide timetables to pursue various alternatives based upon the failure of a system to be adequately modified or sufficiently tested and validated to ensure year compliance 
however  there can be no assurance that either the compliance process or contingency plans will avoid partial or total system interruptions or the costs necessary to update hardware and software would not have a material adverse effect upon downey s financial condition  results of operation  business or business prospects
