item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
overview from its inception in until  the company has focused on designing  manufacturing and marketing tools used in the debugging of embedded software 
the company s product line initially consisted primarily of chassis style in circuit emulators  highly technical tools utilized at that time by hardware engineers 
in the late s  customer demand focused increasingly on tools with greater speed  software sophistication  ease of use and price performance value 
by  the company s sales and profitability began to decline due to various factors  including a poorly targeted product development strategy  slowness in responding to changing customer requirements and increasing competition 
beginning in mid  the company assembled a new management team that devised and began implementing a new business strategy 
as a part of this new strategy  management effected a restructuring of the company  which included significant headcount reductions and a refocusing of its product line by concentrating marketing and engineering activity on new hardware enhanced software tools for use with a broad range of intel and motorola and bit embedded microprocessors  employing advanced hardware designs to reduce size and cost  and emphasizing ease of use by software engineers 
following this restructuring  the company reengineered its pocket sized codetap emulator in late  introduced its compact and more affordable codeice emulator in  and began shipping codetest software testing tools focused on embedded test in late in  the company released supertap  which brings full featured emulation into a codetap form factor 
in  the company released codetest r act  an enhanced suite of mcdc software test and analysis tools for c language applications  and codetrace tm  a source level trace analysis tool 
the company s strategy has resulted in lower average selling prices and increased unit volumes 
the company s sales through its foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in foreign currencies  and as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the company s reported net sales 
the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the company s net sales is dependent in part upon the company s pricing policies 
the company is  however  unable to predict currency exchange rate fluctuations and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue to affect its net sales to varying degrees in the future 
the company expects international sales  especially in japan  to continue to account for a significant percentage of its net sales 
to enhance its competitive position  it will be necessary for the company to continue developing its technology base and broadening its product offerings to address additional needs within the embedded software development process 
these objectives may require expansion of the company s internal product development efforts or acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses  products or technologies in related market segments 
the company believes that the growth rates reflected in results of operations for prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of growth rates for future periods 
the company also believes that competition is likely to increase  which could result in loss of market share  price reductions or reduced margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of income  expressed as a percentage of sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense and other income income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss net sales net sales decreased by to million in from million in and increased by in from million in the decrease in over was primarily attributable to a decline in unit sales of high end debug products and to a lesser extent currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the dollar value of international sales which were partially offset by an increase in unit growth and average selling price of low cost debug tools and to a lesser extent patent license royalties and consulting services 
net sales increased slightly in over which was primarily attributable to the unit growth and average selling price in sales of low cost debug tools and to a lesser extent increase in units sales of codetest tools and an increase in support contract revenues which were partially offset by a decline in unit sales of higher priced debug tools and to a lesser extent currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the dollar value of international sales 
the company s net sales are presently derived predominantly from sales of software design  debugging and testing tools 
the company s net sales also include product support revenues  which represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively  as well as increased patent license royalties and fees from consulting services 
the company generally recognizes revenues from product sales upon shipment  and recognizes product support revenues ratably over the life of each maintenance contract  typically months  and consulting revenues as performed 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
international sales represented  and of total net sales in  and  respectively 
international sales outside of north america in us dollars decreased by in over  and increased by in over the decrease in over is attributable to a reduction in units sales and average selling price directly related to the asian financial crisis  particularly in japan and korea  partially offset by an increase in unit sales in europe 
the increase in over is attributable to increased unit sales primarily in asia  which is due primarily to increased sales and marketing efforts 
the company estimates that unfavorable currency rate fluctuations affecting the dollar value of sales by the company s foreign subsidiaries  especially in japan  resulted in a reduction in the dollar value of the company s net sales in based upon the change from the average rate and a reduction in the dollar value of based upon the change in the average rate 
gross profit cost of sales included materials  labor and overhead incurred in the manufacturing of products as well as the cost of providing consulting services and maintenance 
gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in over was primarily attributable to an increase in the percentage of net sales of newer low cost debug products that have lower material costs as a percentage of sales price and to a lesser extent an increase in royalties and software licenses which were partially offset by lower production over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs and  to a lesser extent  due to declines in sales revenue due to unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the increase in over was primarily attributable to an increase in the percentage of net sales attributable to newer low cost debug and codetest products that have lower material costs as a percentage of sales price and to a lesser extent an increase in higher margin support contract revenue and favorable cost reductions on certain hardware components which were partially offset by declines in sales revenue due to unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increase in factory overhead 
the company expects its gross profit to fluctuate based upon its product mix  geographic mix  product and patent licenses and variances in volume and related absorption of factory overhead costs 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain its recent gross margins 
sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales  million  or of net sales and million  or of net sales  in  and  respectively 
the dollar amount slightly decreased in over was due to a reduction in foreign currency exchange losses and reduction in general operating expenses partially offset by increased headcount and compensation related expenses and promotional costs in connection with the company s expansion of its sales and marketing efforts 
the percentage between comparable periods was basically the same due to the continued budgeted investment in sales and marketing and lower than anticipated revenues 
the dollar amount increase in over was primarily attributable to increased compensation related expenses resulting principally from increased headcount and compensation related expenses  and to a lesser extent  increases in operating expenses  promotional costs and foreign exchange losses 
the percentage increase between comparable periods was primarily attributable to lower than anticipated revenues for the year as compared to the increase in budgeted costs 
the company expects its sales and marketing expenditures to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as it introduces and markets new products  and continues to expand its sales  general and administrative organization 
foreign exchange gains and losses are included in sales  general and administrative expenses 
in order to mitigate certain intercompany risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations  the company  does from time to time  hedge a portion of its foreign exchange risk in japan as it relates to the trade debt the company s japanese subsidiary owes to the company 
although the company generally plans to continue to engage in exchange rate hedging activities with respect to certain exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that it will do so or that any such activities will successfully protect the company against such risks 
research and development research and development expenses were million or of net sales  million  or of net sales and million  or of net sales  in  and  respectively 
the dollar amount increase in over was primarily attributable to an increase in contract labor  headcount and compensation related expenses which was partially offset by a reduction in prototype expenses 
the dollar amount increase in over was primarily attributable to a decrease in external development funding received from third parties that offsets expenses and to an increase in hardware prototype related costs 
the company intends to continue to make substantial investments in product development  including development of software design  debugging and test tools for additional embedded microprocessors as well as continued advanced development in future directions 
as a result  the company anticipates that net research and development expenses are likely to increase for the foreseeable future 
income taxes the company s income tax provision for  and reflect utilization of net operating loss nol and general business credit carryforwards 
as of december  the company had remaining nol carryforwards of million and research and development credit carryforwards of million  both of which will expire in various amounts through the utilization of these amounts in the future is subject to an annual limit of approximately  under the internal revenue code 
as a result of these limitations  the company anticipates that in the future its effective tax rate will approach the statutory rate in future years 
a full valuation allowance has been established for net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty whether they will be realized 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
quarterly results of operations the company s results of operations have in the past fluctuated substantially from quarter to quarter  and the company expects such fluctuations to continue as a result of a variety of factors 
product and price competition  research and development requirements  the volume and timing of customer development projects and orders  introductions of new embedded microprocessors  announcements or introductions of new products or technologies by the company or its competitors  foreign currency exchange rates  investments in marketing and distribution  price increases by suppliers  parts shortages  conditions in the embedded systems market and the electronics industry in general  and national and global economic conditions may be expected to cause significant variations in the company s quarterly operating results 
as a result  the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
moreover  a significant portion of the company s net sales in each quarter generally results from shipments during the last few weeks of the quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital principally for the financing of inventory  capital equipment and accounts receivable  and for investment in product development activities and new technologies 
to date  the company has financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and private placements of equity securities 
in november  the company completed its initial public offering pursuant to which it sold  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
during  the company generated million of cash from operations  utilized million of cash for equipment purchases  and utilized  of cash for net debt reduction 
as of december   the company had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents 
the company has revolving credit facilities aggregating million from a commercial bank 
there were no outstanding balances under these facilities as of december  the credit facilities bear interest at the bank s floating prime rate and are unsecured 
the loan documents also contain customary negative covenants 
the credit facilities expire in may and the company anticipates renegotiating a new line at comparable terms 
the company currently has no specific commitments with regard to capital expenditures  but expects to spend an aggregate of approximately million in for new capital equipment 
the company anticipates that its annual capital expenditures will increase gradually in the future as a function of replacement cycles and anticipated growth of the company s business 
the company s capital needs may be further affected by its plans to broaden product offerings through a combination of internal development  third party relationships and acquisitions of other business products or technologies 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalent balances at year end together with funds from operations and borrowings  will provide the company with sufficient funds to finance its operations for at least the next months 
the company s future capital requirements will  however  depend on a number of factors  including costs associated with product development efforts  the success of the commercial introduction of the company s products and the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent additional capital is required  the company may sell additional equity  debt or convertible securities  or obtain additional credit facilities 
impact of year the company is taking steps to evaluate and minimize the risk presented by the potential impact of the year issue 
the company formed a committee to conduct an assessment of the company s preparedness for the year  as well as the preparedness of third parties relevant to the company s business 
the assessment consists of five phases awareness  which consists of making company personnel  and those at third parties  aware of the year issue  inventory  which consists of identifying the company s operations or systems which are year sensitive  analysis  which consists of determining whether sensitive areas will in fact be adversely impacted by year issues  remediation  which consists of addressing potential year issues  and contingency planning  which consists of developing strategies for those areas where remediation may not be effective or practicable 
in conducting its assessment  the committee evaluated the company s internal information systems  the engineering and product development software  the company s hardware  and general facilities infrastructure 
the assessment has been completed for the company s information system and general facilities infrastructure 
the company has completed the awareness  inventory and analysis phases with respect to other systems 
based on results of these analyses  the company believes the remediation phase will be completed prior to march  the company anticipates that it will complete its contingency planning within months after completing the other phases of its assessment 
the company s business operations information system was upgraded in the standard course of systems maintenance early in the current version has been certified by oracle to be year compliant 
the company is currently in the analysis phase with respect to its assessments of its own product 
the company believes it will have completed the analysis and remediation by march  the company estimates that it has expended approximately  in assessing and re mediating internal year issues  in addition to those upgrades that have been made as part standard system maintenance 
the company does not believe that its assessment and remediation activities have resulted in any material delay or deferral of systems maintenance or upgrades 
the company believes the additional aggregate costs of its internal assessment and upgrade  other than those implemented in the course of normal maintenance and equipment upgrades  will not exceed  to be expended over the next two to three quarters 
the company cannot predict yet the effect of the year problem on its suppliers or the resulting effect on the company 
the company has not yet developed a contingency plan to operate in the event that critical systems of vendors  suppliers  or other third parties are not year compliant and have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company expects to develop such contingency plan by april  if any of the company s critical systems are not in fact year compliant  or if preventive and or corrective actions by those entities with whom the company does business are not made in a timely matter  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
outlook issues and uncertainties the company does not provide forecasts of future financial performance or sales volumes  although this annual report contains certain other forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company may  in discussions of its future plans  objectives and expected performance in periodic reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission or documents incorporated by reference therein and in written and oral presentations made by the company  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of or section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions which the company believes are reasonable  but are by their nature inherently uncertain 
in all cases  there can be no assurance that such assumptions will prove correct or that projected events will occur 
actual results could differ materially from those projected depending on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the issues discussed below 
while company management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating its growth outlook and for forward looking statements 
rapidly changing technology and product development uncertainties 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s future business  financial condition and results of operations will depend upon its ability to anticipate market demand for specific embedded microprocessors  develop new products and features that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices 
manufacturing uncertainties 
a number of the company s components are manufactured by a single source or distributed through a limited number of outlets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able in the future to obtain key components in a timely manner  in sufficient quantities  or on favorable price terms 
product ship schedules 
delays in new product releases could impact revenue growth rates and cause the company s customer base to become dissatisfied and erode 
prices 
prices the company can obtain for its products may decrease from historical levels  depending on competitive market or cost factors which could have an adverse effect on revenues and gross margin 
cost of sales 
although cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased in and  it varies with channel mix and product mix within channels 
such mix factors may increase cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in future periods 
semiconductor manufacturers 
a substantial decline in the number of design starts for bit or bit embedded microprocessors produced by intel  amd or motorola or delays by such manufacturers in the release of embedded microprocessors for which the company has developed tools could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues 
industry focus 
the company s sales are concentrated primarily in the internetworking  telecommunications and computer peripherals markets and any negative events affecting the electronics industry or these markets in particular could have an adverse effect on revenues 
competition 
the company expects competition to increase from established and emerging companies 
sales and marketing and research and development costs may increase in dollar amounts and as a percentage of sales in order for the company to successfully compete 
key personnel 
the company believes that its future success will depend largely upon its ability to retain and attract key personnel and skilled employees 
management of growth 
the company plans to continue to invest in product lines and sales and marketing 
the company s growth plans will present management  competitive and other challenges to the company s managers and employees 
intellectual property 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to protect its technology and preserve its trade secrets 
product liability 
the use of the company s tools in the development of embedded systems that are incorporated in products used by or affecting the general public  or that otherwise pose a risk of serious consequences if they do not perform flawlessly under critical conditions  could expose the company to significant product liability claims 
global economic conditions 
almost half of the company s business occurs outside of north america 
economic crisis in any of these regions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
foreign exchange 
a large percentage of the company s sales  costs of sales and marketing is transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international results of operations are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
litigation 
the company may become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights  patents  and copyrights 
if an adverse judgment were entered against the company  such a proceeding could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operation 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company develops products in the united state and sells in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since sales are currently priced in us dollars and translated to local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of company investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of these short term investments  the company has concluded that there is no material market risk exposure
