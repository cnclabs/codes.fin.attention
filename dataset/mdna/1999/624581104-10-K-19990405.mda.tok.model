item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview from august through july   the company experienced rapid growth in revenue and operating income primarily as a result of acquiring stores and opening new stores 
since the fall of  the company s store base has remained relatively constant as the company has internally developed a similar number of stores as have been closed 
the number of stores owned and operated by the company at the end of each of the following periods is as follows december  december  january  january  january  the results of operations for the fiscal year ended january  include the combined results of the company  home vision entertainment  inc home vision and hollywood video  inc hollywood video 
the acquisitions of home vision and hollywood video were consummated on july  and were accounted for as poolings of interests 
the above store count totals reflect the combined totals of movie gallery  inc  home vision and hollywood video for all periods presented 
during the fiscal year ended january  fiscal  stores were developed by the company  stores were acquired and were closed 
as a result of the store acquisitions during the periods january  through january   the company recorded million in goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over twenty years 
other intangibles  which consist primarily of non compete agreements  are amortized on a straight line basis over two to ten years 
on july   the company adopted a fiscal year that ends on the first sunday following december this change results in the company having a or week year 
the year ended january  fiscal was a week year  while the fiscal year ended january  fiscal and fiscal were week years 
effective july   the company changed its amortization policy for rental inventory  which was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
the major impetus for the change in amortization policy is the changing purchasing economics within the industry and the company  which have resulted in a significant increase in new release videos available for rental 
revenue sharing agreements and other copy depth initiatives have increased customer satisfaction of the video rental experience  especially with respect to new release videos  and  thus  the overall demand for each new release is satisfied sooner 
in order to match more accurately the valuation of tape inventory with accelerated consumer demand  the company has changed its amortization policy for rental inventory 
the application of the new method of amortizing videocassette and video game rental inventory decreased rental inventory and increased depreciation expense for the year ended january  by approximately million and reduced net income and earnings per diluted share by million and  respectively 
under the new amortization method  the cost of base stock videocassettes  consisting of two copies per title for each store  is amortized on an accelerated basis to a net book value of over the first six months and to a salvage value over the next thirty months 
the cost of non base stock videocassettes  consisting of the third and succeeding copies of each title per store  is amortized on an accelerated basis over the first six months to a net book value of  which is then fully amortized on a straight line basis over the next months or until the videocassette is sold  at which time the unamortized book value is charged to cost of sales 
video games are amortized on a straight line basis to a salvage value over eighteen months 
the company will continue to expense revenue sharing payments as revenues are earned pursuant to contractual arrangements 
prior to july   and pursuant to an accounting change effective april   videocassette and video game rental inventory was recorded at cost and amortized over its economic useful life 
videocassettes considered to be base stock were amortized over thirty six months on a straight line basis to a salvage value 
new release videocassettes were amortized as follows i the fourth and any succeeding copies of each title per store were amortized on a straight line basis over the first six months to an average net book value of which was then fully amortized on a straight line basis over the next thirty months or until the videocassette was sold  at which time the unamortized book value was charged to cost of sales and ii copies one through three of each title per store were amortized as base stock 
during fiscal  the company adopted a business restructuring plan to close approximately stores and reduce the corporate organizational staff by approximately 
the restructuring plan resulted in a million pretax restructuring charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal the components of the restructuring charge included approximately million in reserves for future cash outlays for lease terminations  miscellaneous closing costs and legal and accounting costs  as well as approximately million in asset write downs 
approximately million of costs were paid and charged against the liability as of january  the store closures were substantially completed by the end of fiscal additionally  during the third quarter of fiscal the company incurred merger related costs of approximately  related to the acquisition of home vision and hollywood video 
the provision for income taxes includes pro forma adjustments to reflect income tax expense which would have been recognized if hollywood video had been taxed as a c corporation for all periods presented

fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  revenue 
total revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in same store revenues of  offset in part due to fewer average stores open during fiscal versus fiscal the increase in same store revenues was primarily the result of i an increase in the number of copies of new release videocassettes available to customers as a result of copy depth initiatives  including revenue sharing programs and other depth of copy programs available from movie studios  ii an increase in the video game rental business due to both increasing consumer acceptance of the nintendo and sony playstation game platforms and an increase in the number of game titles available for these platforms  and iii successful  chain wide internal marketing programs designed to generate more consumer excitement and traffic in the company s base of stores 
product sales increased as a percentage of total revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in the sales of previously viewed rental inventory 
operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses  which include store level expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll  decreased to of total revenue for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to same store revenue increases  offset in part by an increase in revenue sharing expense of approximately million in fiscal versus fiscal recurring amortization of videocassette rental inventory  excluding the non recurring charge related to the change in amortization policy  decreased in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue to from in fiscal amortization of videocassette rental inventory for all periods ending prior to july   was calculated under the previous policy described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
significantly reduced tape purchase dollars in fiscal versus fiscal  an increased use of revenue sharing  as well as the same store revenue increases in fiscal  are the main reasons that the amortization of inventory as a percentage of revenue in fiscal has declined versus fiscal cost of product sales includes the costs of new videocassettes  confectionery items and other goods  as well as the unamortized value of previously viewed rental inventory sold in the company s stores 
cost of product sales increased with the increase in product sales revenue and increased as a percentage of product sales revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in product sales gross margins is primarily the result of i a concentrated effort by the company to reduce inventory levels through discounts on selected inventory during the first half of  and ii the impact of titanic  which the company sold at a below average profit margin and for which the company sold more units than any sell through priced title in its history 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase is primarily due to fiscal increases in fixed asset depreciation  marketing expenses  salaries and wages and other personnel costs  in part associated with the increase in personnel in the company s real estate department in anticipation of its planned new store development during the fiscal year as a result of the above factors  excluding the impact of the amortization policy change  operating income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  revenue 
total revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in same store revenues of  as well as the net positive effect of closing lower volume stores while internally developing stores that have generated revenue results greater than the closed stores 
the increase in same store revenues was primarily a result of i the company s emphasis in the last half of fiscal to increase the depth of copies of hit titles within its store base  ii an increase in the game rental business due to the advent and consumer acceptance of the nintendo and sony playstation game platforms  and iii a decrease in the number of competitive store openings  particularly in the last half of fiscal product sales increased as a percentage of total revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal  as a result of i the company s continued and increased emphasis on the sale of previously viewed rental inventory  and ii an increase in the variety of other products sold in stores  such as video accessories and confectionery items 
operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses  which reflect direct store expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll  increased to of total revenue for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in store operating expenses was primarily due to i strategic responses in the company s most competitive markets  which affected certain expenses  such as labor hours used and advertising costs  ii the national minimum wage increases that were implemented on september  and september   and iii increases in rent in connection with the normal renewal of leases in existing stores 
amortization of videocassette rental inventory increased as a percentage of revenue to for fiscal from for fiscal due primarily to i a decision by the company to increase its level of expenditures on rental inventory during the fourth quarter of and the first half of in response to industry wide competitive issues  ii an increase in the depth of hit new release titles purchased during the year  which results in more tapes being substantially amortized over six months versus three years  and iii a marked increase in the quantity of new game release purchases  which is due to the buildup of inventory related to the consumer acceptance of new game platforms ie  nintendo and sony playstation 
cost of product sales includes the costs of new videocassettes  confectionery items and other goods  as well as the unamortized value of previously viewed rental inventory sold in the company s stores 
cost of product sales increased with the increased revenue from product sales and increased as a percentage of revenues from product sales from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in product sales gross margins resulted primarily from i an increase in new tape sales which carry lower margins than other sales items  and ii an effort by the company to market more aggressively its new tape inventory 
these factors were offset  in part  by an increase in the sale of previously viewed rental inventory  the unamortized value of which is expensed to cost of product sales and generally generates higher margins than other product categories 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from for fiscal to for fiscal excluding  in merger related expenses associated with the acquisitions of home vision and hollywood video  general and administrative expenses would have been of revenues for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the efficiencies gained from the leveraging of overhead associated with acquisition activity in and a reduction in corporate overhead over the past year 
as a result of the above  operating income was essentially flat at million in both fiscal and fiscal however  excluding the effects of the business restructuring plan  the one time  non recurring increase in amortization of videocassette rental inventory due to the change in amortization policy and the merger related expenses from the home vision and hollywood video acquisitions  operating income would have been million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary capital needs have been for opening and acquiring new stores and for the purchase of videocassette inventory 
other capital needs include the refurbishment  remodeling and relocation of existing stores 
the company has funded inventory purchases  remodeling and relocation programs  new store opening costs and acquisitions primarily from cash flow from operations  the proceeds of two public equity offerings  loans under revolving credit facilities and seller financing 
during fiscal  the company generated million in adjusted ebitda versus million for fiscal the increase in adjusted ebitda is attributable primarily to both the same store revenue increase of and the company s leveraging of rental inventory purchases during fiscal versus fiscal adjusted ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  less the company s purchase of videocassette rental inventory which excludes inventory purchases specifically for new store openings 
adjusted ebitda does not take into account capital expenditures  other than purchases of videocassette rental inventory  and does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is not to be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurements as a measure of operating performance and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the company s definition of adjusted ebitda may not be identical to similarly titled measures of other companies 
the company believes that in addition to cash flows and net income  adjusted ebitda is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing the operating performance of the company because  together with net income and cash flows  adjusted ebitda is widely used in the videocassette specialty retailing industry to provide investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of the company to incur and service its debt and to fund acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal net income was lower in fiscal versus fiscal because of the impact of the change in amortization policy 
however  cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to a decrease in merchandise inventory and an increase in accounts payable  as well as higher depreciation and amortization in fiscal versus fiscal these items were offset  in part  due to a decrease in deferred income taxes and an increase in other current assets in fiscal versus fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this decrease in funds used for investing activities is primarily the result of a decrease in the expenditures of capital for both videocassette rental inventory and property  furnishings and equipment during fiscal versus fiscal net cash used by financing activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this change resulted directly from the company s increased adjusted ebitda generated in fiscal versus fiscal  which allowed the company to decrease its debt outstanding during the year by million 
during fiscal  the company entered into a million reducing revolving credit facility the original facility 
during  the company voluntarily reduced the commitment to million 
the available amount under the original facility began to reduce quarterly on march  with a final maturity date of june  the interest rate of the original facility was based on libor plus an applicable margin percentage  which depended on the company s cash flow generation and borrowings outstanding 
at january   million was outstanding and approximately million was available for borrowing under the original facility 
the original facility was replaced on january  with a new credit agreement with first union national bank of north carolina the new facility 
the new facility provides for borrowings up to million  is an unsecured revolving credit facility and matures on january  the company may increase the amount of the new facility to million after april  if existing banks increase their commitments or a new bank s enter the credit agreement 
the interest rate of the new facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin percentage  which depends on the company s cash flow generation and borrowings outstanding 
the company may repay the new facility at any time without penalty 
the more restrictive covenants of the new facility restrict borrowings based upon cash flow levels 
the company grows its store base through internally developed and acquired stores and may require capital in excess of internally generated cash flow to achieve its desired growth 
the company has announced a planned increase in its unit growth in  which will be accomplished via opening up to internally developed stores and making selective  accretive and strategically consistent acquisitions  if available to the company on reasonable terms 
to the extent available  future acquisitions may be completed using funds available under the new facility  financing provided by sellers  alternative financing arrangements such as funds raised in public or private debt or equity offerings or shares of the compan s stock issued to sellers 
however  there can be no assurance that financing will be available to the company on terms which will be acceptable  if at all 
at january   the company had a working capital deficit of million  due to the accounting treatment of its videocassette rental inventory 
videocassette rental inventory is treated as a noncurrent asset under generally accepted accounting principles because it is a depreciable asset and is not an asset which is reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates the major portion of the company s revenue  the classification of this asset as noncurrent results in its exclusion from working capital 
the aggregate amount payable for this inventory  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  is included in working capital 
consequently  the company believes that working capital is not an appropriate measure of its liquidity and it anticipates that it will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
the company believes its projected cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity with the new facility  cash on hand and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to fund its current plan of operations for fiscal  including its anticipated new store openings 
however  to fund a resumption of the company s acquisition program  or to provide funds in the event that the company s need for funds is greater than expected  or if certain of the financing sources identified above are not available to the extent anticipated or if the company increases its growth plan  the company will need to seek additional or alternative sources of financing 
this financing may not be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
failure to obtain financing to fund the company s expansion plans or for other purposes could have a material adverse effect on the company 
other matters recently issued accounting standards in april  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  reporting the costs of start up activities 
the sop is effective for the company beginning on january   and requires that certain start up costs capitalized prior to january  be written off and any such future start up costs to be expensed as incurred 
the unamortized balance of start up costs as of january  approximately  after tax will be written off as a cumulative effect of an accounting change as of january  the company estimates the impact of adopting this sop will not be material to earnings 
impact of year the company has performed an analysis of its operating systems to determine systems compatibility with the upcoming year substantially all of the company s operating systems are year compliant  including its point of sale system 
while the company has begun to actively replace or modify certain software and hardware so that they will properly function on january  and thereafter  the costs associated with these modifications or replacements have not been material to the company nor does the company believe these costs will be material in the future 
the company s payroll software is not currently year compliant 
however  the company is in the process of replacing its payroll system with a year compliant package that will provide management with better functionality and reporting 
while the current payroll software is the company s largest year issue to resolve  the company believes that its planned software and hardware modifications  as well as its replacement efforts will result in no significant operational problems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the company is currently not aware of any major vendor that is not actively managing the process of being year compliant by december  thus  the company does not believe that there are any vendors with a year issue that would materially impact the results of operations or the liquidity of the company 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that vendors will be adequately prepared for the year the company is developing contingency plans in the event it experiences system failure related to the year the company plans to evaluate the status of year compliance throughout to determine whether such contingency plans are adequate  although at this time the company knows of no reason its modifications and replacements of operating systems will not be effective and completed in a timely manner 
market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments represents the increased interest costs arising from adverse changes in interest rates primarily libor and prime bank rates 
in order to manage this risk  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the company s interest rate exposure on million of the amount outstanding under the new facility at plus an applicable margin percentage 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the libor interest rate and assuming debt levels outstanding as of january   the company would incur an immaterial amount of additional annual interest expense on unhedged variable rate borrowings 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s cost of borrowing 
the analysis does not consider the potential negative impact on overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the company believes that its exposure to adverse interest rate changes and its impact on its total cost of borrowing capital has been largely mitigated by the interest rate swap agreement that is in place
