revenues produced by the company s new service centers during the year ended december  were more consistent with the revenues of the company s other service centers than in prior periods 
higher demand for carrier services also contributed to a more stable pricing environment during the company s results of operations for the year ended december  were also significantly affected by an aggressive account rationalization program initiated by the company in late to improve revenue quality 
by analyzing each account based upon revenue quality characteristics such as revenue per bill and revenue per hundredweight  the company was able to identify accounts providing inadequate profit margins 
while revenue growth was negatively affected by this account rationalization  the company s earnings for the year ended december  were positively affected by the elimination of certain business and tonnage which did not meet the company s margin requirements 
during  the company experienced moderate revenue growth resulting from an increased volume of freight within the company s core service region  as well as new freight from the company s bea expansion facilities in dallas and chicago 
the company s operating income decreased in  however  due to increased costs associated with efforts to optimize and reorganize linehaul operations  as well as staffing increases to provide for higher quality of service and expansion of the bea facilities in dallas and chicago 
as a result  the company experienced only a slight increase in net earnings during  compared to the company s management believes that its expanded terminal network provides the company with the necessary infrastructure for continued growth within its core service region 
with an established terminal network in place to provide high quality service throughout its core service region  the company intends to continue its focus on improving route  lane and service center densities by increasing the amount of business handled by the company within its core service region 
the company intends to achieve this growth by increasing the amount of business generated by existing customers within its core service region and acquiring new customers outside its core service region for the purpose of soliciting new business into its core service region 
the company intends to continue its rigorous analysis of costs and profitability associated with each customer  lane and shipment

inflation inflation has had a minimal effect upon the company s profitability in recent years 
most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation

see item business fuel availability and cost 
the company expects that inflation will affect its costs no more than it affects those of other regional ltl carriers 
seasonality the company experiences some seasonal fluctuations in freight volume 
historically  the company s shipments decrease during the winter months 
in addition  the company s operating expenses historically have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs for revenue equipment in colder weather

forward looking statements include statements concerning plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events  future revenues or performance  capital expenditures  financing needs  plans or intentions relating to acquisitions by the company and other information that is not historical information 
when used in this report  the words estimates  expects  anticipates  forecasts  plans  intends  believes and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
additional forward looking statements may be made by the company from time to time 
all such subsequent forward looking statements  whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of the company  are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
the company s forward looking statements are based upon the company s current expectations and various assumptions 
the company s expectations  beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the company to have a reasonable basis  including without limitation  management s examination of historical operating trends  data contained in the company s records and other data available from third parties  but there can be no assurance that management s expectations  beliefs and projections will result or be achieved or accomplished 
the company s forward looking statements apply only as of the date made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by or underlying the forward looking statements contained in this report 
in addition to the other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report  the following factors are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company should be considered in light of these factors 
economic factors and fuel price fluctuations the availability and price of fuel  insurance costs  interest rates  fluctuations in customers business cycles and national and regional economic conditions are economic factors over which the company has little or no control 
significant increases in fuel prices  interest rates or increases in insurance costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates  or disruptions in fuel supply  would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
a significant downturn in customers businesses  temporary inventory imbalances resulting from a recession or otherwise  or decreased demand for ltl carrier services could also have a material adverse affect on the company 
availability of employee drivers and independent contractors the company utilizes the services of both employee drivers and independent contractors 
competition for employee drivers and independent contractors is intense in the trucking industry  and the company occasionally experiences difficulty attracting or retaining enough qualified employee drivers and independent contractors 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be affected by a shortage of qualified employee drivers or independent contractors in the future  which could result in temporary underutilization of revenue equipment  difficulty in meeting shipper demands and increased compensation levels 
prolonged difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified employee drivers or independent contractors could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
risks associated with geographic expansion as part of the company s growth strategy  the company has established market and operational presence in certain metropolitan areas outside its core service region 
the company is also considering other major distribution centers for additional facilities 
unlike more traditional inter regional expansion models  the company intends only to solicit tonnage from these markets moving west into its core service region 
the company has limited experience with this new operating concept  and no assurance can be given that such operations will be successful in the long term 
capital requirements the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
if in the future the company were unable to borrow sufficient funds  enter into acceptable operating lease arrangements  or raise additional equity  the resulting capital shortage would impair the company s ability to acquire additional revenue equipment and adversely affect the company s growth and profitability 
claims exposure and insurance costs trucking companies  including the company  face multiple claims for personal injury and property damage relating to accidents  cargo damage and workers compensation 
to the extent that the company experiences a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers compensation claims  or an unfavorable development on existing claims  the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
significant increases in the company s claims and insurance costs  to the extent not offset by rate increases  would reduce the company s profitability 
competition the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
competition for freight transported by the company is based primarily on service and efficiency and on freight rates 
the company competes with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent with truckload carriers  railroads and overnight delivery companies 
some of the company s competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of larger trucking companies 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial resources  more equipment and greater freight capacity than the company 
environmental hazards the company s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation  storage  presence  use  disposal  and handling of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes  discharge of stormwater  and underground fuel storage tanks 
the company transports certain commodities that are or may be deemed hazardous substances 
the company also currently maintains above ground and underground fuel storage tanks on several of its properties 
the company is not aware of any fuel spills or hazardous substance contamination on its properties that would have a material adverse effect on the company and the company believes that its operations are in material compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations 
if  however  the company should be involved in a fuel spill  or a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  if any such substances were found on the company s properties  or if the company were found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations  the company could be responsible for clean up costs  property damage  and fines or other penalties  any one of which could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
other factors in addition to the factors described above  the company may be impacted by a number of other matters and uncertainties  including i changes in demand for ltl carrier services  ii potential legislation and regulatory changes  iii the ability of the company and those with which it conducts business to timely resolve year issues  iv changes in competitive conditions in the company s core service region  and v increases in the cost of compliance with regulations  including environmental regulations
