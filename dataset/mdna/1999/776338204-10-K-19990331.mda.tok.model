ronson canada  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
rcpc and ronson canada together comprise ronson consumer products 
the company also distributes its consumer products in mexico 
a subsidiary of walmart stores  inc walmart is a significant distributor for the consumer products segment and  as such  supplies ronson s products to numerous retailers 
management does not believe that this segment is substantially dependent on walmart or its distributor subsidiary because of the presence of many other distributors which provide retailers with ronson s consumer products 
sales to various units of walmart in and accounted for and  respectively  of consolidated net sales of the company and and of net sales of the segment in and  respectively  most of which were to its distributor subsidiary 
the consumer products are distributed through distributors  food brokers  automotive and hardware representatives and mass merchandisers  drug chains and convenience stores in the united states and canada 
ronson consumer products is a principal supplier of packaged flints and lighter fuels in the united states and canada 
these subsidiaries consumer products face substantial competition from other nationally distributed products and from numerous local and private label packaged products 
since ronson consumer products produces packaged products in accordance with its sales forecasts  which are frequently reviewed and revised  inventory accumulation has not been a significant factor  and this segment does not have a significant order backlog 
the sources and availability of raw materials for this segment s packaged products are not significant factors 
ronson consumer products also distributes three lighter products the ronii refillable butane lighter  the ronson windii liquid fuel windproof lighter  and the ronson varaflame ignitor  used for lighting fireplaces  barbecues  camping stoves and candles 
the lighter products are marketed in the united states  canada and mexico

the windii lighter and varaflame ignitor are manufactured in china  both in accordance with the design specifications of the company 
the company has the exclusive right to market these products in the united states  canada and mexico  and does so through its distribution channels 
the varaflame ignitor is refillable with ronson butane refills and is less expensive than most other refillable ignitors 
the varaflame ignitor encounters strong competition from imported disposable ignitors

environmental matters in the conduct of certain of its manufacturing operations  the company is required to comply with various environmental statutes and regulations concerning the generation  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
additionally under isra  operators of particular facilities classified as industrial establishments are required to ensure that their property complies with environmental laws  including implementation of remedial action  if necessary  before selling or closing a facility 
the company s new jersey facilities would be subject to isra should a facility be closed or sold 
in december the company adopted a plan to discontinue the operations in of one of its facilities  prometcor  located in newark  new jersey  and to comply with isra formerly ecra and all other applicable laws 
in october prometcor entered into a memorandum of agreement with the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep as to its njdep related environmental compliance activities respecting its newark facility 
in november prometcor submitted a preliminary assessment  site investigation and remedial investigation report pa si rir to the njdep following extensive testing 
the njdep approved prometcor s pa si rir in the first quarter of prometcor completed the actions required under the approved pa si rir and  in june  submitted its remedial action workplan remedial action report raw rar to the njdep 
as the result of the continuation of sampling and evaluation of the results by the company s environmental consultants and the njdep in and in the first quarter of  areas of contamination in the groundwater below a section of the property were identified 
sampling and delineation have been and are continuing in this area of the property 
prometcor has also proceeded with reporting to the nrc in order to terminate the nrc license held by prometcor 
in through prometcor s radiological consultants performed additional sampling and submitted additional reports to the company and to the nrc 
as a result of the evaluation of the sampling results by the company s radiological consultant and in consideration of comments from the nrc  low level contamination was identified and delineated in certain sections of the prometcor property 
in the second quarter of  the company s consultants completed additional testing 
based on the results of certain of these tests and on discussions with parties interested in the properties  the company determined  in the third quarter of  to demolish the buildings 
the preparation for the demolition required additional testing for final clearance to verify and to supplement the results of previous consultants 
this further testing and significant  unanticipated cleanup were required and completed in january the nrc and njdep accepted the results of the testing for one of the two buildings in february and acceptance of the results of the testing for the other is expected in the next days  approving the demolition of the buildings 
the demolition is in progress and is expected to be completed in april the company s plan for final radiological remediation and clearance of the soils was approved by the nrc in november and by the njdep in february the implementation of this plan will follow the completion of the demolition of the buildings 
the company s plan regarding resolving the non radiological issues in the soil has been approved by the njdep and will be implemented after the demolition has been completed 
the company s plan to resolve the groundwater issue has not yet been approved by the njdep 
a portion of the newark property has already been released by the nrc and the njdep 
in november prometcor completed the necessary radiological cleanup activities for one of the three parcels of property and amended the prometcor license to release this property 
also  in january  the njdep provided a no further action letter for this portion of the property 
it is now available to be sold without any further environmental clearance needed 
the additional sampling and remediation required during demolition and for soil contamination for the two remaining parcels of the newark property are continuing 
the full extent of the costs is not determinable until all testing and remediation have been completed and accepted by the njdep and nrc 
two of the company s subsidiaries are subject to the new jersey underground storage tank law  njsa a et seq 
and the regulations promulgated thereunder  njac b et seq  requiring upgrades to certain types of underground storage tanks 
the company previously replaced its underground storage tanks at rcpc 
in february ronson aviation completed the installation of a new  gallon fueling facility at a total cost of approximately  and ceased use of most of its former underground storage tanks 
the underground storage tanks formerly used by ronson aviation will be closed in place or removed in the extent of any soil and groundwater contamination cannot be determined until testing has been undertaken 
ronson aviation is currently in negotiations with the lessor  the county of mercer mercer  as to the allocation of responsibility between ronson aviation and mercer for the costs of meeting regulatory requirements as to the former tank system and for the installation of the new storage tanks  because the former tanks are owned by mercer 
in addition  most of the tanks pre date the lease between mercer and ronson aviation 
the negotiations with mercer may result in mercer assuming responsibility for the new fueling facility  closure and removal of the former tanks  and all soil and groundwater remediation  if any  found to be required  ronson aviation being responsible for the construction of the new fueling facility  mercer assuming responsibility for the closure and removal of the former tanks  and all or some of the soil and groundwater remediation  with the cost incurred by ronson aviation to be deemed to meet the requirements in the lease for three five year extensions through november  or some other allocation of responsibility for the costs 
the company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under the leasehold and under the statutory and regulatory requirements 
since the ultimate allocation of costs cannot be estimated at this time  the effect on the company s financial position or results of future operations cannot be estimated at this time  but management does not believe that the effect will be material 
in the third quarter  a mechanical failure at ronson aviation resulted in an overfill of a fuel tank and a release of about gallons of jet fuel 
the company has taken appropriate action to address the release and to meet njdep requirements 
ronson aviation expended approximately  in and accrued about  in future costs related to the release 
the company s insurance carriers have been notified of the claim  and management believes that the company will receive a reimbursement for the cost from insurance  but the company has not recorded a receivable for that reimbursement at december  in september the company received a de minimis settlement offer settlement offer from the united states environmental protection agency usepa related to waste disposed of prior to at a landfill in monterey park  california  which the usepa had designated as a superfund site site 
the usepa identified manifests dated from through which allegedly indicate that waste originating at the location of the company s former duarte  california  hydraulic subsidiary was delivered to the site 
as a result  in august the company received a general notice letter from the usepa notifying the company that the usepa considered the company one of about four thousand potentially responsible parties prp s for waste disposed of prior to at a landfill at the site 
in the company sold the duarte  california  hydraulic subsidiary  ronson hydraulic units corporation rhucor ca  to the boeing corporation 
the usepa has notified a subsequent owner of the facility that the usepa considers that entity to also be liable for the costs the usepa determines to be due as a result of rhucor ca s waste having been sent to the site 
the usepa may also consider financial factors in determining the final amount due 
the usepa settlement offer includes various options at costs ranging from  to  in the fourth quarter of  the company offered to settle all liabilities in the matter for payments totalling  to be paid semiannually over three years 
because the usepa has determined that the volume of waste generated by the facility and sent to the site is de minimis  because the usepa has sent a general notice letter to another prp for the same waste and because the company has offered to settle the matter under the above mentioned terms  the company believes that the cost  if any  will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
other than the expenditures related to the replacement and closure of underground storage tanks at ronson aviation  the company believes that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect upon the company s future capital expenditures 
other than the cash requirements related to completing the prometcor environmental clearance and the fact that the full extent of the prometcor costs is not yet determinable  the company believes that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect upon the company s earnings or competitive position 
patents and trademarks the company maintains numerous patents and trademarks for varying periods in the united states  canada  mexico and a limited number of other countries 
while both industry segments may benefit from the company s name as a registered trademark  the patents and trademarks which are held principally benefit the consumer products segment of the company s business
