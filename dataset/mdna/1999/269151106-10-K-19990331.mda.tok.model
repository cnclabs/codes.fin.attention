prior to october  the company leased two facilities in fremont  california 
the leases for such facilities expired on june and october  the facilities consisted of two buildings comprising approximately  square feet  which were used as the company s headquarters 
at the end of  ess purchased acres of land in fremont  california  near its previous facilities 
by the end of  the company completed and occupied a two story   square foot headquarters 
in  the company completed construction of a  square foot building to support headcount growth 
an  square foot dormitory was also completed during during the fourth quarter of  the company established a wholly owned foreign subsidiary in the cayman islands  british west indies and transferred a substantial portion of its business operations to it 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development research and development in process selling  general and administrative operating income loss nonoperating income  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss includes a one time pre and post tax charge of related to acquired research and development in process 
includes a one time pre and post tax charge of related to acquired research and development in process 
net revenues 
net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net revenues decreased between and primarily due to a decrease in asp in both the audio and video markets 
net revenues rose by between and primarily from increased sales of the company s video products 
the company s pc audio products accounted for substantially all of the company s net revenues for and a majority in and international revenues accounted for approximately  and of net revenues for  and  respectively 
the company s net revenues are denominated in us dollars 
the company expects that its percentage of international sales will remain high in the future 
gross margin 
gross profit was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing corresponding gross margins of  and of net revenues for such years 
the decrease in gross margins from to was a result of lower asps on the company s products throughout the year 
the decrease in gross margins from to was a result of lower asps on the company s products throughout the year and an inventory charge to cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of million for excess inventory positions 
during the third quarter of  indication of strong demand led to a high order rate 
after non cancelable production orders were placed  yields improved dramatically and the marketplace demand was lower than expected 
the company was under contractual agreement to pay a pre established per die price  and was unable to realize the benefit of the enhanced yields and was committed to purchase the increased volume 
these factors led to the inventory charge and the decrease in gross profit 
the company s overall gross profit and margin are subject to change due to various factors  including among others  competitive product pricing  unit volumes shipped  new product introductions  yields  wafer costs  assembly costs and product mix 
the company has encountered increased competition from other suppliers who are offering competitive products and new features 
in addition  the company expects the overall asps for its existing products to decline significantly over the life of the products 
the company believes that in order to maintain or increase gross profit  it must achieve higher unit volume shipments  reduce costs  add new features and introduce new products 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to ship higher volumes  reduce costs  add new features or introduce new products that gain market acceptance 
research and development expenses 
on going research and development expenses were million  million and million  or  and of net revenues  in  and  respectively 
research and development in process represents one time pre and post tax charges of million from the acquisition of videocore and osee in the first quarter of and of million from the acquisition of platform in the second quarter of the growth in on going research and development expenses between and was primarily due to the increase in the company s engineering staff  engineering test runs  masks  internal and external consulting expenses and licensing fees associated with the research and development efforts to support the introduction of new products 
the growth in on going research and development expenses between and was primarily due to the increase in amortization of technical infrastructure and covenants not to compete related to the company s acquisitions and a one time charges for impaired assets related to previous acquisitions offset by lower engineering test run and mask charges 
the company expects that research and development expenses will remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that revenues will grow at the same rate as the anticipated research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  and of net revenues  in  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to increased spending for additional sales and administrative employees 
the increase in expense was also due to commissions on higher sales levels and  to a lesser extent  promotional expenses and costs associated with the expansion of the company s sales activities 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to the increase in reserves for accounts receivable  the amortization of covenants not to compete related to the company s acquisitions  one time charge for impaired assets related to a previous acquisition and the expenses associated with the company s conversion to a new management information system 
the company expects to incur higher selling  general and administrative expenses in the future due to the need to increase selling activities  although these expenses are expected to remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that revenues will grow at the same rate as the anticipated selling  general and administrative expenses 
non operating income 
non operating income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  and non operating income consisted primarily of interest income and gains on sale of short term investments 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the tax rate for of reflects a non deductible expense for the one time pre and post tax charge of million related to acquired research and development in process from the acquisition of videocore and osee in the first quarter the pro forma tax rate excluding this charge of million was 
the company s pro forma tax rate for was slightly lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of as a result of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits 
the reported tax rate for of of pre tax income significantly exceeds the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of due to two charges that are not deductible in the federal and state tax returns 
the first charge is the one time pre and post tax charge of million for the acquisition of platform in the second quarter of the second is the charge to increase inventory reserves in the fourth quarter of because the majority of the inventories were held by a foreign subsidiary  a majority of the charge was not deductible on the us federal and state income tax returns 
the reported tax benefit for of of pre tax losses is below the combined federal and state statutory rate of 
it is because a majority of the losses were by a foreign subsidiary and are not deductible on the us federal and state income tax returns 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its cash requirements from cash generated by operations  the sale of equity securities  bank lines of credit and short term and long term debt 
at december   ess had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
as of december   the company had a million line of credit which expires on october  and was secured by land and buildings with a net book value of million 
the line of credit requires the company to achieve certain financial ratios and operating results 
at december   the company was in compliance with its borrowing criteria 
there were no borrowings under the line of credit as of december  in  the company generated net cash from operating activities of million 
this resulted from a reduction in inventory of million  a decrease in prepaids and other assets of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  an increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of million  depreciation and amortization of million and a charge for compensation expense related to stock options of 
million  partially offset by a net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the company received million from sale of its uicc investment  million from the issuance of common stock and the income tax credit from disqualifying disposition of common stock options 
the company invested million in property and equipment  million in the repurchase of stock and million in the net purchase of short term investments 
for the year  cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
in  the company used net cash of million in operating activities 
this resulted from a net loss of million  a gain on sale of short term investments of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventories of million  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a decrease in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of million offset in part by reductions in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  a one time non cash charge for research and development in process of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the company received net proceeds of million from sale of short term investments  million from the issuance of common stock from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan  million in income tax credits from disqualifying disposition of common stock options and million from the acquisition of platform 
the company invested million in uicc joint venture and million in property and equipment 
for the year  cash and cash equivalents declined million 
in  the company generated net cash from operating activities of million 
this resulted from net income of million  a one time non cash charge for research and development in process of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  depreciation and amortization of million and a charge for compensation expense related to stock options of million  less a gain on sale of short term investments of million an increase in inventories of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets at million and a decrease in income taxes and deferred income taxes of million 
the company received net proceeds of million from sale of short term investments  million from the issuance of common stock from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan  and million in income tax credits from disqualifying disposition of common stock options 
the company invested million in property and equipment  repurchased stock for million  paid million on capacity commitments  million for acquisition of videocore and osee and million in uicc joint venture 
for the year  cash and cash equivalents declined million 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of december  together with the cash generated from operations  available borrowings under its line of credit and other financing options  will be sufficient to fund acquisitions of property and equipment and provide adequate working capital through at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be approximately million which will be primarily used to acquire capital equipment 
the company may also utilize cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company may evaluate potential acquisitions of or investment in such businesses  products or technologies owned by third parties 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income which was adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal this statement establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from non owner sources 
such items may include foreign currency translation adjustments  unrealized gains losses from investing and hedging activities  and other transactions 
this statement requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
as the company has no components of other comprehensive income  there are no disclosure requirements involved in the company s adoption of this statement 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which was adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal this statement establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the company expanded its disclosure of geographical areas in accordance with the new standard 
as the company operates and tracks its results in only one segment  there are no additional disclosure requirements involved with the company s adoption of this statement 
year issues general 
the company is currently conducting a company wide year readiness program yk program 
the yk program is addressing the issue of computer programs and embedded computer chips being unable to distinguish between the year and the year therefore  some computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company anticipates that year compliance will be substantially complete by june year program 
the company s year program is divided into four major sections ess manufactured products  internal information it systems  non it systems eg  testing equipment  and third party suppliers and customers 
the general phases common to all sections are inventorying year items  assessing the year compliance of items determined to be material to the company  and repairing or replacing material items that are determined not to be year compliant 
the company has completed its review of substantially all ess manufactured products for year compliance purposes 
the company believes that substantially all of the company s products are year compliant and that those that are not year compliant can be upgraded to be year compliant by june with respect to its internal it computer systems  the company has completed the inventory and review phases of the yk program and has been in the repair or replacement phase 
in february  the company began to install year compliant programs from oracle corporation for approximately percent of its business systems 
this installation was fully implemented by the end of with respect to the remaining internal it computer systems that are not yet year compliant  the company plans to either replace or upgrade them by the end of september the company has completed the inventory phase and year compatibility of its non it systems 
to date  about percent of its non it systems are year compliant 
the company plans to repair or replace those that are not yet year compliant by the end of june the company has been working with its key suppliers and contract manufacturers to assess the possible effects of their year readiness on the company s operations 
although these suppliers and contract manufacturers have notified the company that they have been addressing the problem  they have not provided specific assurance regarding the year compliance of their systems and software 
the company s reliance on suppliers and contract manufacturers and  therefore  on the proper functioning of their information systems and software  means that failure of such key suppliers and contract manufacturers to address year issues could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial results  however  the potential impact and related costs are not known at this time 
costs of the assessment and modification 
the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
through december   the company has spent million to implement year compliant programs from oracle corporation 
the company estimates that it may spend up to an additional  for other replacements or upgrades and for communicating with key suppliers and customers 
risks 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company believes that its year program will help to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its material key suppliers and customers 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the year program as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
we are at work on the development of various types of contingency plans to address potential problems with critical internal systems and third party interactions 
our contingency plans include procedures for dealing with a major disruption of internal business systems  plans for factory shutdown and identification of alternative vendors of critical materials in the event of year related disruption in supply 
contingency planning will continue through at least  and will depend heavily on the results of the remediation and testing of critical systems 
the potential ramifications of a year type failure are potentially far reaching and largely unknown 
we cannot assure you that a contingency plan in effect at the time of a system failure will adequately address the immediate or long term effects of a failure  or that such a failure will not have a material adverse affect on the company 
factors that may affect future results this report contains certain forward looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties 
for such statements  the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section e of and rule b under the securities exchange act of such forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements regarding the company s expectations  intentions of future strategies and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the gain or loss of significant customers  increased competitive pressures  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  including decreases in unit average selling prices asps of the company s products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s and its customers products 
other factors include the availability of foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of raw materials  changes in the mix of products sold  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the market for pcs  seasonal customer demand  the timing of significant orders and significant increases in expenses associated with the expansion of operations 
the company s operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions in various geographic areas where the company or its customers do business  or order cancellations or rescheduling 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could materially affect the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
there can be no assurance as to the level of sales or earnings that may be attained by the company in any given period in the future 
the company currently places noncancelable orders to purchase its products from independent foundries on an approximately three month rolling basis  while its customers generally place purchase orders with the company less than four weeks prior to delivery that may be canceled without significant penalty 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected or forecasted sales levels are not realized  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition  pricing pressures 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  price declines and rapid product obsolescence 
see item business competition 
dependence on the pc and consumer markets 
in  and  sales of pc audio semiconductor chips accounted for a majority of the company s net revenues  and the company expects that sales of audio semiconductors will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
in  sales of video semiconductor chips to the video compact disk vcd player market accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenues 
any reduction in asps or demand for the company s semiconductor chips  whether because of a reduction in demand for pcs or vcd players in general  increased competition or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is currently engaged in the development and introduction of new pc audio  video and modem semiconductor devices for the internet  pc and consumer markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify market trends or new product opportunities  develop and market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by others 
a failure in any of these areas would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business audio drive products  video drive products and teledrive products 
the company s products are sold for incorporation into desktop and notebook computers and vcd players 
therefore  the company is heavily dependent on the growth of the markets and the cost requirements for desktop and notebook computers and vcd players 
there can be no assurance that these markets will be able to grow 
a slowing in unit volume and a decrease in asps could result in a decline in revenues which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
importance of new products and technological changes 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by evolving industry standards  rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the company s success is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive price and performance levels 
the success of new products depends on a number of factors  including timely completion of product development  market acceptance of the company s and its customers new products  securing sufficient foundry capacity for volume manufacturing of wafers  achievement of acceptable wafer fabrication yields by the company s independent foundries and the company s ability to offer new products at competitive prices 
in order to succeed in having the company s products incorporated into new products being designed by its customers  the company must anticipate market trends and meet performance  quality and functionality requirements of such oems and must successfully develop and manufacture products that adhere to these requirements 
in addition  the company must meet the timing and price requirements of such manufacturers and must make such products available in sufficient quantities 
accordingly  in selling to oems  the company can often incur significant expenditures prior to volume sales of new products  if any 
in order to help accomplish these goals  the company has in the past and will continue to consider in the future the acquisition of other companies or the products and technologies of other companies 
such acquisitions carry additional risks such as a lack of integration with existing products and corporate culture  the potential for large write offs and the diversion of management attention 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify market trends or new product opportunities  develop and market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by others 
a failure in any of these areas would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business research and development 
dependence on tsmc and other third parties 
the company relies on independent foundries to manufacture all of its products 
a substantial majority of the company s products are currently manufactured by tsmc  which has manufactured certain of the company s products since the company also has foundry arrangements with umc  which has manufactured certain of the company s products since these relationships provide the company with access to advanced process technology necessary for the manufacture of the company s products 
these foundries fabricate products for other companies and  in certain cases  manufacture products of their own design 
in november  the company entered into long term agreements with tsmc and umc in which the company has secured access to additional capacity and to leading edge technology 
see item business manufacturing 
while the company has entered into long term agreements with its two foundries  the company s reliance on these independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and the international risks more fully described below 
in addition  the company has pre negotiated certain of its purchase orders and could be unable to benefit from enhanced yields realized by its vendors 
the company expects to rely upon tsmc and umc to manufacture substantially all of the company s products for the foreseeable future 
in the event that tsmc and umc are unable to continue to manufacture the company s key products in required volumes  the company will have to identify and secure additional foundry capacity 
in such an event  the company may be unable to identify or secure additional foundry capacity from another manufacturer 
even if such capacity is available from another manufacturer  the qualification process could take six months or longer 
the loss of any of its foundries as a supplier  the inability of the company to acquire additional capacity at its current suppliers or qualify other wafer manufacturers for additional foundry capacity should additional capacity be necessary  or any other circumstances causing a significant interruption in the supply of semiconductors to the company would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to address potential foundry capacity constraints in the future  ess will continue to consider and may be required to enter into additional arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
any such arrangements could require the company to commit substantial capital and grant licenses to its technology 
the need to commit substantial capital may require the company to obtain additional debt or equity financing  which could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be obtained on terms acceptable to the company 
customer concentration 
a limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues 
in  and  sales to the company s top five customers  including sales to distributors  accounted for approximately  and respectively  of the company s net revenues 
in  compaq and universe electron corporation each accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
in  eastbase and dynax  a hong kong distributor  each accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues 
in  dynax and shinco accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues 
sales to distributors are generally subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return and price protection with respect to unsold products 
returns and allowances in excess of reserves could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
during  the company adopted a policy of deferring revenue recognition on sales of devices to distributors in hong kong and taiwan until devices are sold to the end customers 
this has led to increased operational visibility on product moving through the channel 
the company expects that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company has experienced changes from year to year in the composition of its major customer base and believes this pattern may continue 
the company does not have long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of such major customers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  since the company s products are often sole sourced to its customers  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its major customers were to develop other sources of supply 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will not be canceled or will continue at the levels of previous periods or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
management of growth 
the company has experienced significant growth in unit shipments and the addition of multiple product lines that require additional management systems and processes 
to manage its future operations and growth effectively  the company will need to hire and retain management  hire  train  motivate  manage and retain its employees  continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems and implement additional systems and controls 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage such growth effectively  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company has implemented an enterprise wide software package that integrates its core business functions 
should the implementation be incomplete or otherwise problematic  substantial disruption to the business operations of the company could result 
there can be no assurance that the software implementation will not cause business disruptions to the company 
international operations 
during  and  international sales accounted for a substantial majority of the company s net revenues 
substantially all of the company s international sales were to customers in hong kong  taiwan  singapore  japan and korea 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  substantially all of the company s products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
due to its reliance on international sales and foreign third party manufacturing  assembly and testing operations  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include unexpected changes in  or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with its international trade relationships 
although the company has not to date experienced any material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of such regulatory  geopolitical and other factors  there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
currently  all of the company s product sales and all of its arrangements with foundries and assembly and test vendors provide for pricing and payment in us dollars 
in  the effect of significant currency fluctuations in asia had no material impact on the company 
there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  the company has not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although the company may do so in the future 
further  there can be no assurance that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations or require the company to modify its current business practices 
semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
in addition  the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of product prices 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions 
uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary rights 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect its intellectual property rights 
see item business patents and proprietary rights  item legal proceedings 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of fred sl chan  the company s chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board of directors 
the present and future success of the company depends on its ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified senior management  sales and technical personnel  particularly highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software engineers  for whom competition is intense 
the loss of mr 
chan  other key executive officers  key design personnel or software engineers or the inability to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain these employees 
the company currently does not maintain any key man life insurance on the life of any of its key employees 
control by existing shareholders
