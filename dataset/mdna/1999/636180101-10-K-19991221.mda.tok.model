rates and regulation the company is subject to regulation by the securities and exchange commission sec under the broad regulatory provisions of the holding company act  including provisions relating to issuance of securities  sales and acquisitions of securities and utility assets  intra company transactions and limitations on diversification 
the sec and some members of congress have advocated  on either a stand alone basis or in conjunction with legislation which would deregulate the electric industry  the repeal of the holding company act 
the proposed legislation currently under consideration would transfer certain oversight responsibilities to the various state public utility regulatory commissions and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and would expand the access of these bodies to the books and records of companies in a holding company system 
such legislation could actually increase regulation of the company  especially at the state level 
previous sec rule changes  however  have reduced the number of applications required to be filed under the holding company act  exempted some routine financings and expanded diversification opportunities 
the company is unable to predict at this time what the ultimate outcome of current or future legislative and or regulatory initiatives will be and  therefore  what impact such efforts might have on the company 
the utility segment s rates  services and other matters are regulated by the state of new york public service commission nypsc with respect to services provided within new york and by the pennsylvania public utility commission papuc with respect to services provided within pennsylvania 
for additional discussion of the utility segment s rates and regulation  see item  md a under the heading rate matters and item at note b regulatory matters 
the pipeline and storage segment s rates  services and other matters are regulated by the ferc 
sip is not itself regulated by the ferc  but its sole business is the ownership of an interest in independence  whose rates  services and other matters will be regulated by the ferc 
for additional discussion of the pipeline and storage segment s rates and regulation  see item  md a under the heading rate matters and item at note b regulatory matters 
the discussion under item at note b regulatory matters includes a description of the regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheets in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
to the extent that the criteria set forth in such accounting standards are not met by the operations of the utility segment or the pipeline and storage segment  as the case may be  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be eliminated from the company s consolidated balance sheets and such accounting treatment would be discontinued 
in the international segment  rates charged for the sale of thermal energy and electric energy at the retail level are subject to regulation and audit in the czech republic by the czech ministry of finance 
the regulation of electric energy rates at the retail level indirectly impacts the rates charged by the international segment for its electric energy sales at the wholesale level 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries are subject to the same federal  state and local regulations on various subjects as other companies doing similar business in the same locations

sources and availability of raw materials natural gas is the principal raw material for the utility segment 
in  the utility segment purchased bcf of gas 
gas purchases from various producers and marketers in the southwestern united states under long term two years or longer contracts accounted for of these purchases 
purchases of gas in canada and the united states on the spot market contracts of less than a year accounted for of the utility segment s gas purchases 
gas purchases from southern company energy marketing lp and dynegy marketing and trade represented and  respectively  of total gas purchases by the utility segment 
no other producer or marketer provided the utility segment with or more of its gas requirements in supply corporation transports and stores gas owned by its customers  whose gas originates in the southwestern and appalachian regions of the united states as well as in canada 
sip  through independence  proposes to transport natural gas produced in canada and in the midwestern united states 
the exploration and production segment seeks to discover and produce raw materials natural gas  oil and hydrocarbon liquids as described in the business segment discussion contained in this combined annual report to shareholders form k  item  md a and item at notes i business segment information and m supplementary information for oil and gas producing activities 
coal is the principal raw material for the international segment  constituting of the cost of raw materials needed to operate the boilers which produce steam or hot water 
natural gas  fuel oil  limestone and water combined account for the remaining of such materials 
coal is purchased and delivered directly from the mostecka uhelna spoleenost  as mine for horizon s largest coal fired plant under a contract where price and quantity are the subject of negotiation each year 
natural gas is imported by the czech republic government from russia and the north sea and is transported through the transgas pipeline system which is majority owned by the czech republic government and purchased by the international segment from two of the eight regional gas distribution companies 
fuel oil used to fire certain of the boilers is purchased from both domestic czech republic and foreign refineries 
the energy marketing segment depends on an adequate supply of natural gas and electricity 
in  this segment purchased approximately bcf of natural gas and approximately  megawatt hours of electricity 
with respect to the timber segment  highland requires an adequate supply of timber to process 
highland  however  mainly processes timber which is located on land owned by seneca  and therefore  the source and availability of this segment s primary raw material are generally known in advance 
competition competition in the natural gas industry exists among providers of natural gas  as well as between natural gas and other sources of energy 
the continuing deregulation of the natural gas industry should enhance the competitive position of natural gas relative to other energy sources by removing some of the regulatory impediments to adding customers and responding to market forces 
in addition  the environmental advantages of natural gas compared with other fuels should increase the role of natural gas as an energy source 
moreover  natural gas is abundantly available in north america  which makes it a dependable alternative to imported oil 
the electric industry is moving toward a more competitive environment as a result of the federal energy policy act of and initiatives undertaken by the ferc and various states 
it is unclear at this point what impact this restructuring will have on the company 
the company competes on the basis of price  service and reliability  product performance and other factors 
competition the utility segment the changes precipitated by the ferc s restructuring of the gas industry in order no 
are redefining the roles of the gas utility industry and the state regulatory commissions 
state restructuring initiatives are under way  with regulators in both new york and pennsylvania adopting retail competition for natural gas supply purchases 
however  the utility segment s traditional distribution function remains largely unchanged 
for further discussion of state restructuring initiatives refer to item  md a under the heading rate matters 
competition for large volume customers continues with local producers or pipeline companies attempting to sell or transport gas directly to end users located within the utility segment s service territories ie  bypass 
in addition  competition continues with fuel oil suppliers and may increase with electric utilities making retail energy sales 
the utility segment is now better able to compete  through its unbundled flexible services  in its most vulnerable markets the large commercial and industrial markets 
the utility segment continues to i develop or promote new sources and uses of natural gas and or new services  rates and contracts and ii emphasize and provide high quality service to its customers 
competition the pipeline and storage segment supply corporation competes for market growth in the natural gas market with other pipeline companies transporting gas in the northeastern united states and with other companies providing gas storage services 
supply corporation has some unique characteristics which enhance its competitive position 
its facilities are located adjacent to canada and the northeastern united states and provide part of the link between gas consuming regions of the eastern united states and gas producing regions of canada and the southwestern  southern and midwestern regions of the united states 
this location offers the opportunity for increased transportation and storage services in the future 
sip  through independence  is competing for customers with other proposed pipeline projects which would bring natural gas from the chicago area to the growing northeast and mid atlantic united states markets 
in combination with expansion projects of transcontinental gas pipe line corporation and anr pipeline company  independence intends to provide the least cost path for this service and will access the storage and market hub at leidy  pennsylvania 
it is likely that not all of the proposed pipelines will go forward and that the first project built will have an advantage over other proposed projects 
independence is attempting to be the first of the proposed projects approved by the ferc and the first built 
if completed  the independence pipeline would likely create opportunities for increased transportation and storage services by supply corporation 
competition the exploration and production segment the exploration and production segment competes with other gas and oil producers and marketers with respect to its sales of oil and gas 
the exploration and production segment also competes  by competitive bidding and otherwise  with other oil and natural gas exploration and production companies of various sizes for leases and drilling rights for exploration and development prospects 
to compete in this environment  seneca originates and acts as operator on most prospects  minimizes risk of exploratory efforts through partnership type arrangements  applies the latest technology for both exploratory studies and drilling operations and focuses on market niches that suit its size  operating expertise and financial criteria 
competition the international segment horizon competes with other entities seeking to develop foreign and domestic energy projects 
horizon  through sct and pszt  faces competition in the sales of thermal energy to large industrial customers 
currently  electric energy sales are made to the regional electric distribution companies 
the czech ministry of finance has announced plans to privatize these distribution companies 
while it is expected that these plans will increase competition at the retail level of the electric energy market  it is unclear at this point what impact this privatization will have on the wholesale electric energy market 
both sct and pszt sell electricity at the wholesale level 
competition the energy marketing segment the energy marketing segment competes with other marketers of electricity and natural gas and with other providers of energy management services 
although the deregulation of electric and natural gas utilities is a relatively new occurrence  the competition in this area is well developed with regard to price and services and derives primarily from both local and regional marketers 
competition the timber segment highland competes with other sawmill operations and seneca competes with other suppliers of timber 
this competition may be local  regional  national or international in scope 
these competitors  however  are primarily limited to those entities which either process or supply high quality hardwoods species  such as cherry  oak and maple as veneer  or saw logs or export logs ultimately used in the production of high end furniture  cabinetry and flooring 
the timber segment markets its products both nationally and internationally 
seasonality variations in weather conditions can materially affect the volume of gas delivered by the utility segment  as virtually all of its residential and commercial customers use gas for space heating 
the effect on the utility segment in new york is mitigated by a weather normalization clause which is designed to adjust the rates of retail customers to reflect the impact of deviations from normal weather 
weather that is more than warmer than normal results in a surcharge being added to customers current bills  while weather that is more than colder than normal results in a refund being credited to customers current bills 
in the international segment  district heating operations in the czech republic are also subject to the seasonality of weather 
volumes transported and stored by supply corporation may vary materially depending on weather  without materially affecting its earnings 
supply corporation s rates are based on a straight fixed variable rate design which allows recovery of all fixed costs in fixed monthly reservation charges 
variable charges based on volumes are designed only to reimburse the variable costs caused by actual transportation or storage of gas 
variations in weather conditions can materially affect the volume of gas and electricity consumed by customers of the energy marketing segment 
the activities of the timber segment vary on a seasonal basis and are subject to weather constraints 
the timber harvesting and processing season occurs when timber growth is dormant and runs from approximately september to march 
the operations conducted in the summer months focus on pulpwood and on thinning out lower grade species from the timber stands to encourage the growth of higher grade species 
capital expenditures a discussion of capital expenditures by business segment is included in item  md a under the heading investing cash flow and subheading expenditures for long lived assets 
environmental matters a discussion of material environmental matters involving the company is included in item  md a under the heading other matters and in item  note h commitments and contingencies 
miscellaneous the company had a total of  full time employees at september    employees in all of its us operations and  employees in its international segment 
this represents a decrease of from the  total employed at september  agreements covering employees in collective bargaining units in new york were renegotiated in november  effective december  and are scheduled to expire in february agreements covering most employees in collective bargaining units in pennsylvania have been renegotiated  effective november  and are scheduled to expire in april and may the company has numerous municipal franchises under which it uses public roads and certain other rights of way and public property for the location of facilities

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared with the company s earnings were million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis  in this compares with earnings of million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
earnings for included a million after tax non cash impairment of the exploration and production segment s oil and gas assets and the non cash cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
the accounting change  which was a change in depletion methods for the exploration and production segment s oil and gas assets  had a negative million after tax  or per common share  non cash cumulative effect through fiscal  which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal excluding these two non cash special items  earnings for would have been million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
the increase in earnings of million exclusive of the two non cash special items in is the result of higher earnings in the utility  timber  energy marketing and international segments and in corporate operations 
these higher earnings were offset in part by reduced earnings in the exploration and production segment 
the pipeline and storage segment s earnings remained level with the prior year 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows 
compared with the company s earnings were million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis  in these earnings include the two non cash special items discussed above 
without these two non cash items  earnings for would have been million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
this compares with earnings of million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis  in the earnings decrease in was attributable to lower earnings of the company s utility  exploration and production and energy marketing segments  offset in part by higher earnings in the pipeline and storage segment and in the international and timber segments both of which incurred a loss in 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows 
discussion of asset impairment and cumulative effect of a change in depletion method seneca follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas operations 
under this method  all costs directly associated with property acquisitions  exploration and development are capitalized  up to certain specified limits 
due to significant declines in oil prices in  seneca s capitalized costs under the full cost method of accounting exceeded these limits at march  seneca was required to recognize an impairment of its oil and gas producing properties in the quarter ended march  this charge amounted to million pretax and reduced net income for by million 
effective october   seneca changed its method of depletion for oil and gas properties from the gross revenue method to the units of production method 
the units of production method was applied retroactively to prior years to determine the cumulative effect through october  this cumulative effect reduced earnings for by million  net of income tax 
depletion of oil and gas properties for and has been computed under the units of production method

utility revenues utility operating revenues year ended september thousands retail revenues residential    commercial    industrial    off system sales    transportation    other    utility throughput mmcf year ended september retail sales residential    commercial    industrial    off system sales    transportation    intrasegment throughput compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this resulted from a reduction in retail and off system gas sales revenue of million and million  respectively  and a reduction in other operating revenue of million 
these decreases were partly offset by an increase in transportation revenue of million 
the recovery of lower gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues and the general base rate decrease in the new york jurisdiction effective october  caused the decrease in retail gas revenue 
the recovery of lower gas costs resulted from both lower retail volumes sold of billion cubic feet bcf and a lower average cost of purchased gas see discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
despite weather that was colder than the prior year  retail volumes sold decreased  mainly due to the migration of residential and small commercial retail customers to transportation service 
this is the result of customers turning to marketers for their gas supplies while using distribution corporation for gas transportation service 
restructuring in the utility segment s service territory is further discussed in the rate matters section that follows 
transportation revenue increased and volumes are up bcf as a result of the migration noted above and because of colder weather 
off system revenue is down due to lower volumes sold of bcf 
off system sales are a function of demand in the northeast markets 
record storage levels at the beginning of the heating season and a warmer than normal winter in reduced demand for off system sales 
the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal 
the decrease in other operating revenue of million is due primarily to a million gas restructuring reserve reducing revenue in the current year  million of revenue recorded in as a result of internal revenue service irs audits and million of a revenue reduction in the current year due to a final irs audit settlement 
these items are offset in part by a million lower refund provision recorded in as compared with the refund provision 
the gas restructuring reserve is to be applied against incremental costs resulting from the new york public service commission s nypsc gas restructuring efforts the nypsc s gas restructuring efforts are further discussed in the rate matters section that follows 
the revenue related to the irs audits represents the rate recovery of interest expense as allowed by the new york rate settlement of the refund provision represents the sharing with customers of earnings over a predetermined amount in accordance with the new york rate settlements of and all of these items are included in the other category of the utility operating revenue table above 
compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this resulted from a reduction in retail sales revenue of million offset in part by higher off system sales revenue  transportation revenue and other revenue of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in retail gas revenue was caused by the recovery of lower gas costs offset in part by a general base rate increase in the new york jurisdiction effective october  the recovery of lower gas costs resulted from a decrease in retail gas sales of bcf and a decrease in the average cost of purchased gas see discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
while the decrease in gas sales also reflects  in part  the migration of residential and small commercial retail customers to transportation service  the major reason for the decrease stems from warmer weather which was on average warmer in than in see degree days table below 
the increase in other operating revenue of million is due primarily to million of revenue recorded in as a result of irs audits  as discussed above  and million of refund pool revenue  as discussed below  offset in part by a million higher refund provision recorded in as compared with the refund provision represents the sharing with customers of earnings over a predetermined amount in accordance with the new york rate settlement of as part of the rate settlement with the nypsc  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain credits referred to as the refund pool to offset certain specific expense items 
in september  distribution corporation recognized million of the refund pool as other operating revenue and recorded an equal amount of operation and maintenance o m expense in accordance with the settlement agreement 
earnings compared with in the utility segment  earnings were million  up million from the prior year 
this was largely because the settlement of the primary issues of irs audits of years had a negative impact on earnings in in addition  adjustments made relating to the final settlement of these audits had a positive impact to earnings in the current year 
absent the irs audit items  earnings of the utility segment were up million from the prior year 
lower o m and interest expenses  a lower refund provision in the current year as noted in the revenue discussion above  positive adjustments for lost and unaccounted for gas related to and and slightly colder weather which mainly benefits the pennsylvania jurisdiction  were the positive contributors to earnings this year 
these items offset the costs associated with the current year s early retirement offers which totaled million  pretax  for this segment  as well as the effects of a rate settlement that included a million rate reduction in new york that became effective october  and a special million pretax reserve to be applied against incremental costs resulting from the nypsc gas restructuring efforts  as discussed above 
the impact of weather on distribution corporation s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc in new york  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits distribution corporation s new york customers 
in  the wnc in new york preserved earnings of approximately million after tax as weather  overall  was warmer than normal for the period of october through may since the pennsylvania rate jurisdiction does not have a wnc  uncontrollable weather variations directly impact earnings 
in the pennsylvania service territory  weather was colder than and warmer than normal 
the pennsylvania jurisdiction s colder weather in compared with increased earnings by approximately million after tax 
compared with utility segment earnings were million  down million from this decrease was largely the result of the utility segment incurring interest expense in  net of related rate recovery  in connection with the settlement of the primary issues relating to the previously referred to settlement of the irs audits 
absent this interest expense  the utility segment s earnings were down million as compared to warmer weather in compared with was the primary cause of the decrease 
partly offsetting the earnings decrease caused by warmer weather  the utility segment experienced a decrease in o m expense as a result of management s continued emphasis on controlling costs 
also contributing to this decrease  o m expense included million of pretax expenses associated with an early retirement offer to certain pennsylvania operating union employees in in  the wnc in new york preserved earnings of approximately million after tax as weather  overall  was warmer than normal for the period of october through may in the pennsylvania service territory  weather was warmer than and warmer than normal 
the pennsylvania jurisdiction s warmer weather in compared with lowered earnings by approximately million after tax 
degree days percent warmer colder than year ended september normal actual normal prior year buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is currently the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs can be attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation can satisfy a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per thousand cubic feet mcf in  a decrease of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was lower than the per mcf in pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation    interruptible transportation firm storage service    interruptible storage service other    pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation    interruptible transportation    compared with operating revenues decreased million in compared with the decrease resulted primarily from lower firm transportation revenue of million  lower interruptible transportation and storage service revenue of million  lower net revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation of million and an accrual for a gas imbalance payable of million 
these items were offset in part by higher firm storage service revenue of million and higher cashout revenue of million 
approximately million of the decrease in the firm transportation revenue related to pass through type items ie  surcharges and refunds that correspondingly reduced o m expense  thus having no bottom line earnings impact 
interruptible transportation and storage service revenue decreased and interruptible volumes transported decreased bcf as a result of full storages at the beginning of the heating season and a warmer than normal winter in  thus supply corporation lacked available storage space to service interruptible customers 
lower interruptible storage service generally results in lower interruptible transportation 
the higher cashout revenue a cash resolution of a gas imbalance whereby a customer pays supply corporation for gas it receives in excess of amounts delivered into supply corporation s system by the customer s shipper is offset by an equal amount of purchased gas expense  thus there is no bottom line earnings impact 
transportation volumes in this segment decreased bcf 
generally  volume fluctuations do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable sfv rate design 
however  as mentioned above  lower interruptible transportation volumes did negatively impact revenue for compared with operating revenues decreased million in compared with the decrease resulted primarily from lower net revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation of million  lower firm storage service revenues of million and lower cashout revenue of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in firm transportation revenue of million resulting from demand charges related to the incremental expansion of this segment s niagara import facilities and higher interruptible transportation and storage service revenues of million 
transportation volumes in this segment increased bcf 
as noted above  generally  volume fluctuations do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s sfv rate design 
however  the increase in capacity stemming from the above noted incremental expansion contributed to higher demand charge revenue 
higher interruptible transportation volumes also increased revenues 
earnings compared with earnings in the pipeline and storage segment remained at million for and lower revenues  as discussed above  and nonrecurring income in from a buyout of a firm transportation agreement by a customer in the amount of million pretax  were offset by lower o m and interest expenses 
items causing lower o m expense in when compared to include the establishment of reserves  in  for preliminary survey and investigation costs associated with a proposed incremental expansion project and a natural gas gathering project mainly due to lack of interest in furthering these projects 
in addition  supply corporation recognized a base gas loss at its zoar storage field in in total  these three items amounted to million of pretax expense in in  supply corporation reversed million pretax of the gathering project reserve as it recovered that amount from its former project partner 
also in  supply recovered  through insurance  million pretax related to the zoar base gas loss 
several significant items also increased o m expense in when compared to  including early retirement offers in which totaled million  pretax  for this segment and the reversal of a portion of a reserve set up in a prior period for a storage project 
supply corporation was able to recover approximately million pretax by selling preliminary engineering  survey  environmental and archeological information from this storage project to the independence pipeline company the independence pipeline project is discussed further under investing cash flow  subheading pipeline and storage 
compared with in the pipeline and storage segment  earnings for of million increased million when compared with this was mainly due to supply corporation s portion of interest income from the previously mentioned settlement of irs audits 
additional income tax expense related to certain unsettled issues was also recorded 
absent these irs audit items  earnings would have been down million when compared with this decrease reflects the lower revenues  as discussed above  and an increase in o m expense 
these items were offset in part by lower interest expense and a buyout of a firm transportation agreement by a customer in the amount of million pretax 
the higher o m expenses resulted primarily from the above noted establishment of reserves associated with a proposed incremental expansion project and a natural gas gathering project and the base gas loss at zoar storage field 
partially offsetting these increases in o m expense was the reversal of a portion of a reserve set up in a prior period for a storage project and the fact that o m expense included million of pretax expenses associated with an early retirement offer 
exploration and production revenues exploration and production operating revenues year ended september thousands gas after hedging    oil after hedging    gas processing plant   other   compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with oil production revenues  net of hedging activities  increased million as production increased mainly the result of west coast production from the properties acquired in 
gas production revenue  net of hedging activities  increased million due to higher production also mainly the result of west coast production from the properties acquired in 
refer to the tables below for production and price information 
revenue from seneca s gas processing plant  acquired as part of the harcor energy  inc harcor and bakersfield energy resources ber acquisitions in may and june  was up million 
these items were partly offset by a negative mark to market revenue adjustment related to written options of million 
refer to further discussion of written options in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the main reason for the increase was the million in revenues related to the gas processing plant acquired in  as noted above 
while this gas processing plant contributed a large amount of revenue  this revenue was basically offset by an equal amount of expense 
gas production revenues  net of hedging activities  decreased million as a result of decreased production  offset in part by higher gas prices after hedging 
refer to the tables below for production and price information 
the gas production declines were mainly due to the shut in of production during the gulf hurricane season and tropical storms  as well as the expected decline in production of west cameron and delays in drilling due to lack of rig availability in the first half of the year 
oil production revenues  net of hedging activities  were basically even with as increased production was offset by lower oil prices after hedging 
the increase in oil production was mainly the result of west coast production from the properties acquired in the whittier trust company  harcor and ber acquisitions

seneca utilizes price swap agreements and options to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
refer to further discussion of these hedging activities below under market risk sensitive instruments and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
earnings compared with in the exploration and production segment  earnings of million are down million exclusive of the two non cash special items in when compared with this is largely because the settlement of the primary issues of irs audits of years had a positive impact on earnings in the prior year 
absent the irs audit items  earnings of the exploration and production segment were down million from the prior year 
depressed oil and gas prices for much of were the main reason for these lower earnings 
higher oil and gas production revenue  as noted in the revenue section above  was offset by increases in lease operating  depletion and interest expense related mainly to seneca s acquisition activity in the increase in the gas processing plant revenue of million was largely offset by an increase in related expenses of million 
compared with earnings in the exploration and production segment were million in exclusive of the two non cash special items  down million from this segment s earnings include interest income related to the previously mentioned settlement of irs audits 
without the positive contribution from this interest income  earnings would be down million when compared with this decrease was mainly because of low oil prices  decreased gas production for reasons discussed in the revenue section above and higher lease operating and interest costs related to seneca s acquisition activities in these circumstances more than offset the positive contribution to earnings that resulted from higher oil production and higher gas prices after hedging 
international revenues international operating revenues year ended september thousands heating    electricity   other  international heating and electric volumes year ended september heating sales gigajoules    electricity sales megawatt hours   gigajoules one billion joules 
a joule is a unit of energy 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the increase in revenues as well as the increase in heat and electric volumes  as shown in the tables above  reflects the fact that was the first year in which a full twelve months of sales and revenues are included for pszt 
sales and revenues for include only eight months of activity as pszt was acquired in february compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the increase primarily reflects of the revenues of sct and pszt for horizon acquired a equity interest in sct in april  subsequently increasing that interest to by september  and thus accounted for its investment in sct under the equity method in 
during  horizon increased its ownership in sct to as of september  in february  horizon acquired a equity interest in pszt and subsequently increased its ownership interest to as of september  the consolidation method was used to account for the investments in sct and pszt during earnings compared with the international segment s earnings were million  or million higher than earnings 
the current year s earnings reflect a full twelve months of results from pszt  while the prior year only included eight months of earnings 
the contribution from these additional months in was offset in part by higher interest expense during in addition  earnings included a million pretax net gain associated with us dollar denominated debt  which did not recur in the current year 
this debt was converted to a czech koruna denominated loan in december compared with the international segment s earnings of million in were up million when compared to the loss recognized in this segment realized increases from horizon s share of earnings from its two main investments in district heating and power generation operations located in the czech republic 
because of the change in the nature of operations of the international segment over the past three years  earnings comparisons between  and may not be meaningful 
future revenues from district heating operations are expected to fluctuate with changes in weather 
energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging    electricity  other energy marketing volumes year ended september natural gas mmcf    compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with this increase reflects higher marketing volumes as nfr customers increased from  at september  to  at september  over of the increase in customers was residential 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with this increase reflects higher marketing volumes as nfr customers increased from  at september  to  at september  nfr utilizes exchange traded futures and exchange traded options to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
refer to further discussion of these hedging activities below under market risk sensitive instruments and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings were million  an increase of million over earnings 
volumes of natural gas marketed have increased to bcf in from bcf in and margins were up from the prior year 
these positive contributions to earnings were partly offset by higher expenses for labor  office expense and advertising 
compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings for of million were million below earnings 
although volumes of natural gas marketed were up bcf  lower earnings reflect lower margins and higher o m expense in the increase in o m expense mainly resulted from expansion of nfr s customer base into new market areas 
timber revenues timber operating revenues year ended september thousands operating revenues    compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million 
this increase was primarily the result of higher timber sales by seneca of million and increased log sales and kiln dry lumber sales of million and million  respectively  by highland 
revenue growth reflects the increased investment by this segment in timber and sawmills 
compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million as a result of higher timber sales by seneca and increased lumber sales resulting from highland s purchase in of two new lumber mills 
highland also had a full year of production from the mill it purchased in january earnings compared with timber segment earnings of million in were up million when compared with as noted above  timber revenues increased by 
these higher revenues were partly offset by higher o m  depletion and interest expenses 
earnings growth reflects the increased investment by this segment in timber and sawmills 
compared with timber segment earnings of million in were up million when compared to the loss recognized in higher revenues from the operations of two new sawmills purchased in helped drive the earnings increase 
other income and interest charges although variances in other income items and interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  following is a recap on a consolidated basis other income other income decreased million in and increased million in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in interest income related to the settlement of irs audits 
in and  million and million  respectively  of interest income was recognized related to these audits 
lower other income in also reflects two items recorded in a net gain of million associated with us dollar denominated debt carried on the balance sheet of pszt and a buyout of a firm transportation agreement by a pipeline and storage segment customer in the amount of million 
partly offsetting these items is a million gain recorded in resulting from the demutualization of an insurance company 
as a policyholder  the company received stock of the insurance company as part of its initial public offering 
the increase in other income is primarily due to the above noted million of interest income related to the settlement of irs audits  the million net gain associated with us dollar denominated debt  the million buyout of a firm transportation agreement by a pipeline and storage segment customer  as well as million of interest income on temporary cash investments of sct and pszt 
interest charges interest on long term debt increased million in and million in the increase in both years can be attributed mainly to a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding 
long term debt balances have grown significantly over the past several years primarily as a result of acquisition activity in the exploration and production and international segments 
other interest charges decreased million in and increased million in the decrease in compared to  as well as the increase in compared with  resulted primarily from the million of interest expense recorded in related to the settlement of irs audits 
in addition  in and  interest on short term debt increased mainly as a result of higher average amounts of debt outstanding 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources and uses of cash during the last three years are summarized in the following condensed statement of cash flows sources uses of cash year ended september millions provided by operating activities capital expenditures investment in subsidiaries  net of cash acquired investment in partnerships other investing activities short term debt  net change long term debt  net change issuance of common stock dividends paid on common stock dividends paid to minority interest effect of exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and temporary cash investments operating cash flow internally generated cash from operating activities consists of net income available for common stock  adjusted for noncash expenses  noncash income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
noncash items include depreciation  depletion and amortization  deferred income taxes  minority interest in foreign subsidiaries  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for depletion and the impairment of oil and gas producing properties 
cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s sfv rate design 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  an increase of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the increase is attributed primarily to the utility segment s contribution offset partly by a decrease in cash provided by operations in the exploration and production segment 
the increase in the utility segment is mainly the result of lower o m expenditures combined with lower cash disbursements for taxes and interest 
while cash receipts from gas sales and transportation service were down  this decrease was substantially offset by lower gas purchase expenditures 
the decrease to cash provided by operations in the exploration and production segment is primarily because of an increase in interest payments stemming from higher debt related to the acquisitions made in investing cash flow expenditures for long lived assets expenditures for long lived assets include additions to property  plant and equipment capital expenditures and investments in corporations stock acquisitions or partnerships  net of any cash acquired 
the company s expenditures for long lived assets totaled million in the table below presents these expenditures by business segment total investments expenditures capital in corporations for long year ended september  millions expenditures or partnerships lived assets utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international energy marketing timber all other utility the majority of the utility capital expenditures were made for replacement of mains and main extensions  as well as for the replacement of service lines

independence intends to build a mile natural gas pipeline independence pipeline from defiance  ohio to leidy  pennsylvania at an estimated cost of million 
if the independence pipeline is not constructed  sip s share of the development costs including sip s investment in independence pipeline company is estimated not to exceed million 
exploration and production exploration and production segment capital expenditures included approximately million on the offshore program in the gulf of mexico  including offshore drilling expenditures  offshore construction and lease acquisition costs 
the remaining million of capital expenditures included onshore drilling and construction costs for wells located in louisiana  texas and california as well as onshore geological and geophysical costs  including the purchase of certain d seismic data 
of this amount  approximately million was spent on development drilling  workover  recompletion and facility construction costs on the leases acquired last year in the midway sunset  lost hills area of california 
international the majority of the international segment capital expenditures were made by pszt for the construction of new fluidized bed boilers at its district heating and power generation plant to comply with stricter clean air standards 
short term borrowings and cash from operations were used to finance these capital expenditures 
in fiscal  horizon  through a wholly owned subsidiary  increased its ownership interest in sct to for a minimal cost 
sct in turn increased its ownership interest in jablonecka teplarenska a realitni  as jtr  a district heating plant in the northern bohemia region of the czech republic  from to 
the cost of acquiring these additional shares was approximately million million  net of cash acquired and was financed with short term borrowings and cash from operations 
energy marketing the capital expenditures consisted primarily of the purchase of furniture  equipment and computer hardware and software for nfr s gas marketing operations 
timber the majority of the timber segment s capital expenditures consisted of the purchase of  acres of land and timber from pennzenergy company for approximately million 
the acquisition was financed with short term borrowings 
the remaining million of capital expenditures in this segment were for other land  timber and equipment purchases 
other investing activities other cash provided by or used in investing activities primarily reflects cash received on the sale of various subsidiaries investments in property  plant and equipment  and cash used for investments in a mutual fund 
estimated capital expenditures the company s estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are year ended september millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international timber estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a minor extent  the installation of new services 
estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated in the reconditioning of storage wells and the replacement of storage and transmission lines 
the estimated capital expenditures also include approximately million for the purchase of an additional interest in both the niagara spur loop line a mile  inch pipeline extending from lewiston  new york to east aurora  new york and the ellisburg leidy line pipelines and facilities extending from ellisburg  pennsylvania to leidy  pennsylvania 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment includes approximately million for the offshore program in the gulf of mexico 
of this amount  approximately million is intended to be spent on exploratory and development drilling 
the estimated expenditures also includes approximately million for the onshore program 
of this amount  approximately million is intended to be spent on exploratory and development drilling 
estimated capital expenditures for the international segment will be concentrated in the areas of improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants in the czech republic 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations and partnerships 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or storage facilities and the expansion of transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow in order to meet the company s capital requirements  cash from external sources must periodically be obtained through short term bank loans and commercial paper  as well as through issuances of long term debt and equity securities 
the company expects these traditional sources of cash to continue to supplement its internally generated cash during the next several years

fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt 
in march  the company obtained authorization from the sec  under the holding company act  to issue long term debt securities and equity securities in amounts not exceeding billion during the order s authorization period  which extends to december  in august  the company obtained authorization from the sec under the securities act of to issue up to million of debt and equity securities 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
under the company s existing indenture covenants  at september   the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of million in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at projected market interest rates 
in addition  at september   the company had regulatory authorizations and unused short term credit lines that would have permitted it to borrow an additional million of short term debt 
the amounts and timing of the issuance and sale of debt and or equity securities will depend on market conditions  regulatory authorizations  and the requirements of the company 
the company is involved in litigation arising in the normal course of its business 
in addition to the regulatory matters discussed in note b regulatory matters  in item of this report  the company is involved in other regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business that involve rate base  cost of service and purchased gas cost issues 
while the resolution of such litigation or other regulatory matters could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the year of resolution  neither such litigation nor these other regulatory matters are expected to materially change the company s present liquidity position nor have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company at this time

pszt would have paid approximately million to settle the interest rate swap at september  rate matters utility operation new york jurisdiction on october   the nypsc approved a rate plan for distribution corporation for the period beginning october  and ending september  the plan was the result of a settlement agreement entered into by distribution corporation  staff for the nypsc staff  multiple intervenors an advocate for large industrial customers and the state consumer protection board 
under the plan  distribution corporation s rates were reduced by million  or 
in addition  customers are receiving up to million in bill credits  disbursed volumetrically over the two year term  reflecting a predetermined share of excess earnings under a settlement 
an allowed return on equity of  above which additional earnings will be shared equally with the customers  was maintained from a settlement 
finally  as provided by the rate plan  million of revenues were set aside in a special reserve to be applied against distribution corporation s incremental costs resulting from the nypsc s gas restructuring effort further described below 
on november   the nypsc issued its policy statement concerning the future of the natural gas industry in new york state and order terminating capacity assignment policy statement 
the policy statement sets forth the nypsc s vision on how best to ensure a competitive market for natural gas in new york 
that vision includes the following goals effective competition in the gas supply market for retail customers  downward pressure on customer gas prices  increased customer choice of gas suppliers and service options  a provider of last resort not necessarily the utility  continuation of reliable service and maintenance of operations procedures that treat all participants fairly  sufficient and accurate information for customers to use in making informed decisions  the availability of information that permits adequate oversight of the market to ensure fair competition  and coordination of federal and state policies affecting gas supply and distribution in new york state 
the policy statement provides that the most effective way to establish a competitive market in gas supply is for local distribution companies to cease selling gas 
the nypsc hopes to accomplish that objective over a three to seven year transition period  taking into account statutory requirements and the individual needs of each local distribution company ldc 
the policy statement directs staff to schedule discussions with each ldc on an individualized plan that would effectuate our vision 
in preparation for negotiations  ldcs will be required to address issues such as a strategy to hold new capacity contracts to a minimum  a long term rate plan with a goal of reducing or freezing rates  and a plan for further unbundling 
in addition  staff was instructed to hold collaborative sessions with multiple parties to discuss generic issues including reliability and market power regulation 
distribution corporation has participated in the collaborative sessions 
these collaborative sessions have not yet produced a consensus document on all issues before the nypsc 
distribution corporation will continue to participate in all future collaborative sessions 
distribution corporation was recently advised  on an informal basis  that its individualized plan for restructuring to effectuate 
the nypsc s 
vision may be included in discussions anticipated in connection with the current rate settlement  which expires on its own terms on september  on june   the nypsc issued a notice requesting comments on staff s proposal for a single retailer billing environment 
the proposal recommends that electric and gas utilities exit the billing function at an undetermined future date 
the retail billing function would then be performed solely by unregulated marketers 
included in the billing proposal is a recommendation that utilities design a back out credit equal to the long run costs avoided by each utility when billing is provided by another party 
distribution corporation filed comments opposing much of the proposal but supporting a suggested interim regime where multiple billing arrangements  including utility billing  would be permitted 
this proceeding remains pending 
in anticipation of a nypsc order partially adopting staff s recommendation  distribution corporation is exploring the development of a retail billing service for sale to marketers serving aggregated customers 
there is a market for retail billing services in distribution corporation s service territory  and distribution corporation believes that a service can be designed that will meet the approval of the regulators 
pennsylvania jurisdiction distribution corporation currently does not have a rate case on file with the pennsylvania public utility commission papuc 
management will continue to monitor its financial position in the pennsylvania jurisdiction to determine the necessity of filing a rate case in the future 
effective october   distribution corporation commenced a papuc approved customer choice pilot program called energy select 
energy select  which lasted until april   allowed approximately  small commercial and residential customers of distribution corporation in the greater sharon  pennsylvania area to purchase gas supplies from qualified  participating non utility suppliers or marketers of gas 
distribution corporation was not a supplier of gas in this pilot 
under energy select  distribution corporation delivered the gas to the customer s home or business and remained responsible for reading customer meters  the safety and maintenance of its pipeline system and responding to gas emergencies 
nfr was a participating supplier in energy select 
effective february   distribution corporation s system wide energy select tariff was approved by the papuc 
this program is intended to expand the energy select pilot program described above to apply across distribution corporation s entire pennsylvania service territory 
the plan borrows many features of the energy select pilot  but several important changes were adopted 
most significantly  the new program includes distribution corporation as a choice for retail consumers  in furtherance of distribution corporation s objective to remain a merchant 
also departing from the pilot scheme  distribution corporation resumes its role as provider of last resort and maintains customer contact by providing a billing service on its own behalf and  as an option  for participating marketers 
a natural gas restructuring bill was signed into law on june  entitled the natural gas choice and competition act act  the new law requires all pennsylvania ldcs to file tariffs designed to provide retail customers with direct access to competitive gas markets 
distribution corporation submitted its compliance filing on october  for an effective date on or about july  the filing largely mirrors the energy select program currently in effect  which substantially complies with the act s requirements 
currently the parties to the proceeding are engaged in routine discovery and settlement discussions have begun 
distribution corporation is unable to predict the outcome of the proceeding at this time 
base rate adjustments in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions do not reflect the recovery of purchased gas costs 
such costs are recovered through operation of the purchased gas adjustment clauses of the appropriate regulatory authorities 
pipeline and storage supply corporation currently does not have a rate case on file with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
its last case was settled with the ferc in february as part of that settlement  supply corporation agreed not to seek recovery of revenues related to certain terminated service from storage customers until april   as long as the terminations were not greater than approximately of the terminable service 
supply corporation has been successful in marketing and obtaining executed contracts for such terminated storage service at discounted rates and expects to continue obtaining executed contracts for additional terminated storage service as it arises 
other matters environmental matters it is the company s policy to accrue estimated environmental clean up costs investigation and remediation when such amounts can reasonably be estimated and it is probable that the company will be required to incur such costs 
distribution corporation and supply corporation have estimated their clean up costs related to former manufactured gas plant and former gasoline plant sites and third party waste disposal sites will be in the range of million to million 
the minimum liability of million has been recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at september  other than discussed in note h referred to below  the company is currently not aware of any material additional exposure to environmental liabilities 
however  adverse changes in environmental regulations or other factors could impact the company 
the company is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
the company has established procedures for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and comply with regulatory policies and procedures

year numerous media reports have heightened concern that information technology computer systems  software programs and semiconductors may not be capable of recognizing dates after the year because such systems use only two digits to refer to a particular year 
such systems may read dates in the year and thereafter as if those dates represent the year or thereafter and  in certain instances  such systems may fail to function properly 
state of readiness the company believes that all necessary work has been completed in order to make its internal computer system year ready 
following the completion of an early impact analysis study  a formal project manager at the company was designated to spearhead the year remediation effort 
the methodology adopted by the company to address the year issue is a combination of methods recommended by respected industry consultants and efforts tailored to meet the company s specific needs 
the company s year plan addresses five primary areas 
a 
mainframe corporate business applications developed and maintained by the company a detailed plan and impact analysis was conducted in to determine the extent of year implications on the company s mainframe based computer systems 
the remediation and testing in this area have been completed 
b 
personal computer business applications software developed and supported by the company distribution corporation and supply corporation have retained a consulting firm to perform a detailed impact analysis of the personal computer business application systems supported by the company s information services department 
seneca has similarly retained a consulting firm to review its year issues 
these firms have either corrected year problems identified by their analysis or advised the respective subsidiaries of the potentially problematic computer applications 
certain applications identified by the consulting firms as potentially problematic have been retired and replaced with year compliant applications 
the required changes and testing for these applications are complete 
c 
vendor supplied software  hardware  and services for corporate business applications supported by the company this category includes all mainframe infrastructure products as well as all pc client server software and hardware 
the company has sent letters to its vendors asking if their products and services will continue to perform as expected after january  these vendors are responsible for approximately products and services associated with corporate computer applications 
the company has received responses from all vendors which the company believes supply critical hardware  software  date sensitive embedded chips and related computer services 
the company has completed testing and implementation of the vendor supplied year ready products and services 
d 
vendor supplied products and services used on a corporate wide basis this category includes the critical products and services that are used by multiple departments within the company including all products containing embedded chips which might be date sensitive 
the company has sent letters to the primary vendors who provide these products and services to the company  requesting year compliance plans 
the company is monitoring their responses and has incorporated them into the company s overall year project and contingency plans 
the company has completed testing and implementation of the products and services of these vendors reference is made to the risks section below 
e 
user department maintained business applications the company uses certain business software applications that were either built in house or vendor supplied and subsequently maintained by individual departments of the company 
the scope of such applications includes  but is not limited to  spreadsheets  databases  vendor provided products and services and embedded process controls 
a corporate wide year task force is in place and has established a process to identify and resolve year problems in this area 
this task force meets on a monthly basis to coordinate ongoing activities and report on the project status 
providers of critical products and services have been identified and the company has sent letters requesting their year compliance plans 
responses are being monitored and incorporated into the year planning of the various departments 
based on responses received to date along with internal testing  the company believes that all applications and services under this category are year ready 
cost the cost of upgrading both vendor supplied and internally developed systems and services is expensed as incurred and has amounted to approximately million in total 
minimal additional expenses related to year administration are expected to be incurred 
risks the company s main concern is to ensure the safe  reliable and uninterrupted production and delivery of natural gas and company provided services to its customers 
based on the efforts discussed above  the company expects to be able to operate its own facilities without interruption and continue normal operation in year and beyond 
however  the company has no control over the systems and services used by third parties with whom it interfaces 
while the company has placed its major third parties on notice that the company expects their products and services to perform as expected after january   the company cannot predict with accuracy the actual adverse consequences to the company that could result if such third parties are not year compliant 
the widespread failure of electric  telecommunication  and upstream gas supply could potentially affect gas service to utility customers  and the company is pursuing contingency plans to avoid such disruptions 
the majority of the devices which control the company s physical delivery system are not believed to be susceptible to year problems because they do not contain micro processors 
the company has conducted an extensive review of its existing micro processors embedded technology and has replaced non year compliant hardware 
distribution corporation is subject to regulatory review by both the nypsc and the papuc 
both of these regulatory bodies have issued orders concerning the year issue  and both have established dates in by which jurisdictional utilities must have taken the necessary steps to ensure that its critical systems are year ready 
distribution corporation has  to date  met the requirements of those orders and will continue to comply with such orders for the pertinent time periods specified in such orders 
contingency planning the company formed its corporate year task force in mid the primary function of this group was  and continues to be  to raise awareness of the year issue within the company  facilitate identification and remediation of year potential problems within the company  and facilitate and develop corporate contingency plans 
the group is comprised of middle to senior level managers and company executives 
the company has developed year strategic contingency plans which have been prioritized in relation to the overall corporation in the order of human safety  reliability delivery of company services and administrative services 
the company has added the operational specifics to these plans and is continuing to hone them through operational drills 
during september through november  distribution corporation and supply corporation conducted year readiness drills at critical company owned operating facilities eg compressor stations  pipeline interconnect locations  and gas dispatching control centers to simulate operation under the low probability occurrence of loss of local electricity or communications primarily telephone 
these drills tested backup generation equipment  alternative communication functionality radios  and our employees preparedness to manually operate the physical gas delivery system should these low probability events occur 
these drills also tested and sharpened the company s readiness to dispatch and make safe any customer emergencies  which might occur during a loss of electrical supply or communications functionality 
the company will have a very significant incremental workforce in the field during the critical year rollover period new year s eve 
the pertinent portions of these plans have been filed with the nypsc whose review is ongoing 
distribution corporation and supply corporation are currently working with other utilities in their service areas and regional emergency management services to establish communication channels and procedures in the low probability event of a serious year disruption 
the company has always had disaster contingency plans to deal with operational gas supply or delivery problems  loss of the corporate data center  and loss of the corporate customer telephone centers 
these plans  in conjunction with the year drills  enable the company to verify its readiness and ability to operate in the event of failures resulting from year problems arising outside of the company ie  loss of electricity  telephone service  ie all critical year contingency plans have been completed 
all of the above year information is a year readiness disclosure made pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act of effects of inflation although the rate of inflation has been relatively low over the past few years  and thus has benefited both the company and its customers  the company s operations remain sensitive to increases in the rate of inflation because of its capital spending and the regulated nature of a significant portion of its business
