revenues of  for fiscal year were  above fiscal year s revenues 
subscription revenues of  the second highest in the history of the company  were  or above revenues in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in subscription revenues from the prior year s level is due primarily to a increase in revenues from the value line investment survey and related products  including an increase of almost  in fiscal s revenues from new products 
investment management fees and services revenues of  for the fiscal year ended april   were  or  above the prior year s revenues 
the higher revenues from investment management fees and services  compared to the prior year  resulted primarily from an increase in the year to date average net assets under management in the company s mutual funds 
this was partially offset by reduced revenues from individually managed asset accounts 
during fiscal  the company also recorded as revenues a gain of  from the sale of the company s north bergen  new jersey  vacant operating facility 
operating expenses for the year ended april   were   or  above last year s total expenses of  total advertising and promotional expenses of  were  or  above the prior year s expenses 
promotional expenses for the value line family of mutual funds were  above the prior fiscal year s expenses primarily due to an increase in expenses relating to a selling arrangement for two of the company s equity mutual funds of which the company is the adviser 
in addition  the current year s advertising expenses for the value investment survey and related products and for new publications  including value line select  were  and  respectively  higher than the prior year s expenses 
salaries and employee benefit expenses of  were above expenses of  recorded in the prior year 
the increase from the prior year is primarily the result of revisions to the salary structure in the research department  employment of additional staff in the asset management and y divisions  and general increases in salaries and incentive compensation granted in march and august these increases were partially offset by the capitalization of  of employee salaries and fringe benefits associated with the adoption of sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed for internal use 
production and distribution costs of  were below expenses of  for the fiscal year ended april  increases in production and distribution expenses associated with new publications and increased expenses for software and internet development and maintenance were offset by lower expenses for paper usage  service mailers  and subscriber guides resulting from lower production runs for print publications 
in addition  april production expenses included approximately  of expenses related to the compupower corporation s migration of production and distribution data from a mainframe system to a client server database 
office and administration expenses of  were above last year s expenses of  the increase in administrative expenses from the prior year s level is primarily due to increased fees for professional services  higher property rent pursuant to a scheduled rent increase included in the company s new york city lease  and additional depreciation expenses resulting primarily from a change to the asset lives assigned to personal computers 
these increases were partially offset by lower consulting fees at the company s fulfillment operation and reduced insurance expenses 
in addition  the receipt of proceeds of  from the settlement of an intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which the company was the plaintiff reduced fiscal s office and administrative expenses 
the company s securities portfolios produced income of  during fiscal year  a decrease of  from last year s income of  this was due primarily to a  reduction in the size of the capital gain distributions from the company s family of mutual funds 
the lower capital gains distributions from the value line mutual funds resulted from management s effective tax planning decisions to minimize capital gain distributions from the company s mutual funds 
the tax planning strategy maintained fund shareholder values while reducing the tax liability for all value line mutual fund shareholders  including the company 
although the company s earnings were lower due to the reduced taxable capital gain distributions  shareholder s equity increased by the appreciation in the value of the long term securities portfolio that resulted from the higher net asset value of the mutual fund shares 
this was a direct result of minimizing the realization of taxable capital gains within the value line mutual funds 
in addition  the lower capital gains from the company s trading portfolio that resulted from a decrease in the average assets invested in this portfolio also contributed to the decline in the income from securities transactions 
liquidity and capital resources value line  inc the company had liquid resources which are used in its business of  at april  in addition to  of working capital  the company had long term securities available for sale with a market value of  that  although classified as non current assets  are also readily marketable should the need arise 
the company s cash flow from operations of  for fiscal was  higher than fiscal s cash flow primarily due to increased income from operations  the timing of payments for income taxes and higher volume of prepayments for subscriptions to the company s products resulting from an increase in total new  full term orders 
this increase to cash flow was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable that resulted from the efficiencies in order processing in the new subscription fulfillment system 
net cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal were  higher than fiscal s outflows due primarily to the company s decision during fiscal to invest additional cash in its short term trading portfolio to support its trading strategies 
the receipt of  of proceeds during fiscal  primarily from the sale of the company s north bergen  new jersey vacant operating facility also contributed to the increase from fiscal s cash flow from investing activities 
year yk our year planning was launched in with an initial assessment of the company s systems  its risk of exposure  the steps necessary to achieve yk compliance  and the resources necessary to implement those steps 
the first phase of the plan involved a complete assessment of the company s systems and a survey of vendors 
systems were categorized into three groups mission critical  critical  and non critical 
mission critical systems are systems that would result in a disruption of service or services 
critical systems are defined as those that could cause minor disruption of services 
non critical systems are defined as those that would have no significant impact on operations or services 
the second phase of the project was the actual replacement and or modification of systems and applications 
this phase also included the implementation of the modified applications back into the production environment 
the second phase has been completed since january state of readiness yk we are now well into the third phase of the project testing and further implementation based on test results 
due to the timely and successful initial assessment of the company s year readiness  we are able to continue to enhance our current products  create new products and release updated versions of our electronic products while still maintaining our yk test environments throughout the year 
anticipated costs yk the company s fiscal year expenditures for the yk project were  the company s fiscal year expenditures for the yk project were  the company s fiscal year budget is projected to be  these expenditures include new software and hardware  allocation of staff time  temporary assistance for clerical tasks  legal counsel  testing tools and external  third party monitoring of the company s yk implementation plan 
risks yk we cannot predict with certainty what will happen as the millennium approaches 
we cannot be sure that we will find every problem in the company s systems  that the vendors the company relies upon will find every problem in their systems  or that the securities industry will not experience system failures that will negatively and materially impact value line 
the company will continue to work toward compliance and urge its vendors to do the same  but niether the company  nor its vendors  can predict the future with certainty 
contingency planning yk value line is in the process of finalizing contingency plans to account for the possible failure of every mission critical system 
whether this involves performing tasks manually  or locating alternative vendors for mission critical software and hardware systems  value line is committed to having viable contingency plans developed for every mission critical system 
we continue to reassess and adjust our risk management process and contingency plans 
we believe we have sufficient planning to properly communicate and coordinate any disruption that the turn of the century could cause to our production environment 
we are carefully monitoring our third party vendors and should have a better understanding of their yk readiness by june of we will continue to monitor and evaluate all vendors yk status beyond the year recent aicpa pronouncements the accounting standards committee of the aicpa recently issued statement of position sop which requires entities to adopt uniform rules in their financial statements in accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop requires companies to capitalize as long lived assets  for fiscal years beginning after december   many of the costs associated with developing or obtaining software for internal use to amortize those costs over the software s estimated useful life in a systematic and rational manner 
the company capitalized  of expenses during fiscal year that qualifies for amortization under the new statement 
accordingly  earnings have increased to the extent of the capitalized costs net of amortization of during fiscal year thereafter  assuming capitalized costs remain constant  the initial increase in earnings will diminish as the capitalized costs are amortized 
once the amount capitalized in the first year of application is fully amortized  the increase in earnings due to this accounting change will cease provided the amount capitalized each year remains constant 
management believes that the company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted operations 
management anticipates no borrowing for fiscal year fiscal operating results revenues and operating income for the twelve months ended april  were the highest in the history of the company and exceeded the prior year s levels by and  respectively 
furthermore  the operating profit margin for the fiscal year was also a company record 
revenues for the three months ended april  were the second highest in value line s history

the special dividend of  paid during january significantly reduced the company s securities portfolios 
this reduction in the securities portfolios was the primary reason for the lower level of net income in fiscal revenues of  for the twelve months of fiscal were  or above the comparable results for fiscal subscription revenues for the twelve months of fiscal of  were below revenues for the comparable period of fiscal  primarily a result of the reduction in fulfillment revenues from former third party clients of the compupower corporation and reduced levels of revenues from the value line mutual fund survey  print publication

assets under management in the company s mutual funds at april  increased from the levels at april  expenses for the twelve months ended april  were  below last year s comparable level of  advertising expenses of  were below the prior year s level 
advertising for the value line investment survey family of products decreased from the prior year s level because of a strategic reduction in advertising campaigns during periods of uncertain financial market stability 
promotional expenses for the value line mutual funds increased  from fiscal s level 
the increase in expenses relates primarily to a selling arrangement that became effective july  for two of the equity funds for which the company is the advisor 
salary and employee benefit expenses of  for twelve months of fiscal were above the prior year s level 
fiscal s expenses include an increase in employment recruitment costs and the employment of additional staff for technology initiatives to automate and upgrade information systems that will increase the number of company s covered in the various value line equity publications and year  planning and execution 
additionally  the reduction in compupower s staff  as a result of the termination of services to third parties  contributed to the stable level of expenses

the remaining expenses decreased from the prior year s level primarily due to the lower costs associated with production and distribution of the electronic products as compared with the print publications  an approximate reduction in the cost of paper  shorter production runs and the utilization of new technology that maximizes nd class discounts offered by the us postal service 
office and administration expenses of  decreased  or from the prior year s level 
this reduction was in part due to non recurring professional fees related to a lawsuit from which the company received a  award 
additionally  expenses for fiscal include a charge of  for the writedown of goodwill at the company s fulfillment subsidiary resulting from a decision to restructure these operations 
administrative expenses for fiscal also include a negotiated settlement with the former landlord of the company s headquarters facility in which the company received proceeds of the company s securities portfolios produced income from securities transactions for the twelve months ended april  of  compared with  during the same period of last fiscal year 
the primary cause for the decrease was the reduced levels of capital gains and dividend income from the company s mutual fund holdings that resulted from the smaller size of those securities portfolios 
the reduction in the portfolios resulted from the per share special dividend distributed to all shareholders in january following the company s achievement of record earnings during six of the last eight fiscal years 
also  the twelve months of fiscal include  of capital gains of which  resulted from sales of the company s long term mutual fund holdings in connection with the special dividend

the company s cash flow from operations of  increased  from last year s level primarily as a result of the larger tax payments remitted during the prior fiscal year that resulted from the additional income from securities transactions 
also  the increase in unearned revenues from new business and decline in accounts receivable from collections contributed to the increase in cash flow 
cash flows from investing activities during fiscal were  higher than fiscal s results due to the receipt of proceeds from sales of mutual fund holdings in preparation of the special dividend paid in january the company recognizes the need to ensure that its computer systems and software applications are converted to a year date with no disruption to business operations 
in light of this  the company has established a central committee to coordinate  evaluate and implement changes necessary for compliance 
additionally  the company is communicating with suppliers  financial institutions and others with which it does business to ensure that they are also compliant with the year date 
significant areas of operations which will be impacted have already been identified and conversion efforts are underway 
the total cost of compliance and its effect on the company s future results of operations are being determined as part of the detailed conversion planning 
the cost  including routine hardware enhancements and modifications to software applications  is not expected to exceed  the accounting standards committee of the aicpa recently issued the statement of position sop which requires entities to adopt uniform rules in their financial statements in accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop requires companies to capitalize as long lived assets many of the costs associated with developing or obtaining software for internal use and to amortize those costs over the software s estimated full life in a systematic and rational manner 
management estimates that the company currently expenses approximately  of expenses that would qualify for amortization under the new statement 
management believes that the company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted operations 
management anticipates no significant borrowing requirements during fiscal
