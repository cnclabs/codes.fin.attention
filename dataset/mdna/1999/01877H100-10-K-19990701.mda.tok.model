item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in february to focus on the design and development of high performance semiconductor memory products 
in march the company filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the reorganization 
all of the company s obligations set forth in the plan of reorganization  as modified  were satisfied  and  in august  the company received a final decree from the bankruptcy court 
since  the company s business strategy has been to be a supplier of high performance memory products and memory intensive logic products  operating on a fabless basis by utilizing independent manufacturing facilities and  more recently  joint venture facilities as well 
due to favorable market acceptance of sram products introduced by the company  annual revenues grew rapidly through fiscal in addition  from september through september  gross profit increased primarily due to reductions in average unit product costs  higher average selling prices  a shift to higher margin products and an increase in manufacturing capacity to address the increased demand for sram products 
as a result  operating income also experienced substantial growth during that same period 
from october through the first half of fiscal  gross profit decreased primarily due to a decline in average selling prices and to pre tax inventory related charges 
the company recorded pre tax charges in fiscal  and of approximately million  million and million respectively  primarily to adjust the valuation of the company s inventory to reflect declines in market value for certain of the company s products 
from april  through the early part of fiscal  substantially all of the company s net revenues were derived from the sale of sram products 
during fiscal  dram products accounted for approximately of net revenues  sram products accounted for approximately of net revenues and graphics products accounted for approximately of net revenues 
the company had introduced mbit dram in mbitx configuration in fiscal during fiscal  the company commenced volume production in micron geometry  of mbit drams in a kbitx configuration and of mbit drams in a mbitx configuration 
the company enhanced its sram product line with the introduction of industrial temperature srams and in april introduced its intelliwatt tm mbit sram products 
the company continued development and sales of graphics accelerator products  and developed its first embedded product  which combines d d graphics controller with megabytes of embedded memory 
in july  the company decided to exit the mainstream graphics accelerator business  and announced a workforce reduction of approximately full time positions  including substantially all of the company s graphics personnel 
the company also put into volume production a mbit flash product and introduced a mbit flash design 
during fiscal  the company introduced mbit dram in mbitx configuration 
the market for memory products used in personal computers is characterized by price volatility and has experienced significant fluctuations and cyclical downturns in product demand  such as the severe price erosion of drams in fiscal  and while the company s strategy is to increase its penetration into the networking  telecommunications  instrumentation and consumer markets with its existing sram  dram and flash products and to develop and sell in volume quantities new products complementary to its existing products  the company may not be successful in executing such strategy 
a decline in demand in the personal computer industry or lack of success in developing new markets or new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
results of operations the percentage of net revenues represented by certain line items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated  are set forth in the table below 
percentage of net revenues for year ended march  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative loss from operations other income  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss before equity in income of usc net revenues the company s net revenues declined to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately 
revenues for fiscal year included approximately million related to the mmui accelerator product line discontinued during the second quarter 
the decrease in net revenues in fiscal was due to a combination of lower average selling prices and the drop in the unit shipments of the company s sram  dram and mmui products 
revenues from the company s dram product family contributed approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal during fiscal  the average selling prices for the company s drams declined significantly 
the dram market is characterized by volatile supply and demand conditions  adverse effects of asia s financial problems  more oems switching to build to order processes and rapid technology changes to higher density products 
the company is unable to predict when or if such price declines will stabilize 
a continued decline in average selling prices of drams due to competitive conditions  including overall supply and demand in the market  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
revenue from the company s sram product family contributed approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal in general  sram prices continued a steady decline throughout fiscal sales of the company s mmui product line did not contribute significant revenue during fiscal and prior years 
the mmui graphics and video accelerator market is characterized by a large and growing number of competitors providing a steady stream of new products with enhanced features 
in july  the company decided to exit the mainstream graphics accelerator business  and announced a workforce reduction of approximately full time positions  including substantially all of the company s graphics personnel 
the company s flash memory products did not contribute significant revenue during fiscal and prior years 
the company continues to focus its efforts in selling to non pc segments of the market  such as telecommunications  networking  datacom and consumer 
sales to non pc customers accounted for of q fiscal revenues versus during the same quarter of fiscal two customers accounted for approximately and of net revenues during fiscal one customer accounted for of net revenues during fiscal during fiscal  no customer accounted for or more of net revenues 
during fiscal years  the company experienced significant deterioration in the average selling prices for its sram and dram products 
the company believes that the decrease in average selling prices was due to a number of factors  including increased supply of srams and drams from foreign and domestic competitors and weakening unit demand for such products 
generally  the markets for the company s products are characterized by volatile supply and demand conditions  numerous competitors  rapid technological change  and product obsolescence 
these conditions which could require the company to make significant shifts in its product mix in a relatively short period of time 
these changes involve several risks  including  among others  constraints or delays in timely deliveries of products from the company s suppliers  lower than anticipated wafer manufacturing yields  lower than expected throughput from assembly and test suppliers  and less than anticipated demand and selling prices 
the occurrence of any problems resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
gross profit loss the company s gross profit for fiscal was approximately million or approximately of net revenues compared to a gross profit of approximately million or approximately of net revenues for the same period in fiscal the decrease in gross profits primarily resulted from the million pre tax inventory charges recorded principally during the first two quarters of fiscal in recognition of lower average selling prices together with the decline in the unit shipments and lower average selling prices for the company s dram  sram  and mmui products due to competitive market conditions 
the company s gross profit for fiscal was approximately million or approximately of net revenues compared to gross profit of approximately million or approximately of net revenues in fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal resulted primarily from increased unit demand for dram products  lower cost of production for dram and sram products  and introduction to volume production of newer  higher density sram products 
these increases slightly more than offset pre tax charges in fiscal of approximately million compared with pre tax charges in fiscal of approximately million primarily to adjust the value of the company s inventory to reflect declines in market value 
the company is unable to predict when or if declines in the average selling prices of the company s products will stabilize 
a continued decline in any of such average selling prices could result in a material decline of the company s gross profits unless the company is able to reduce its cost per unit to offset such declines 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce its cost per unit at a level to offset a decline in average selling prices 
in fiscal year  and  the company recorded a material valuation adjustments with respect to its inventory  primarily to reflect a decline in the market value of such inventory 
the company is subject to a number of factors that may have an adverse impact on gross profits  including the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling prices  changes in the mix of product sold  and the timing of new product introductions and volume shipments 
in addition  the company may seek to add additional foundry suppliers and transfer existing and newly developed products to more advanced manufacturing processes 
the commencement of manufacturing at a new foundry is often characterized by lower yields as the manufacturing process is refined 
there can be no assurance that the commencement of such manufacturing will not have a material adverse effect on the company s gross profits in future periods 
research and development research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits for engineering design  contracted development efforts  facilities costs  equipment and software depreciation and amortization  wafer masks and tooling costs  test wafers and other expense items 
research and development expenses were approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal  and approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal  and approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal the decrease in spending between fiscal and was due to lower engineering headcount and personnel related costs as well as lower mask and tooling charges due to the discontinuance of the mmui accelerator product line in july during fiscal  the company s development efforts focused on advanced process and design technology involving srams  drams  flash memory and mmui accelerator products 
the company believes that investments in research and development are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace and accordingly  research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars and may also increase as a percentage of net revenue in future periods 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses generally include salaries and benefits  sales commissions  marketing costs  travel  equipment depreciation and software amortization  facilities costs  bad debt expense as well as insurance and legal costs for the company s sales  marketing  customer support and administrative personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were approximately million or approximately of net revenues compared to approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal the decrease in spending in fiscal compared to fiscal was due principally to lower outside sales commissions which was a result of a decrease in net revenues  which was partially offset by higher legal fees associated with the sram anti dumping proceeding 
in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million or of net revenues compared to approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal was principally the result of higher sales commissions associated with the increase in net revenues and legal fees associated with the sram anti dumping proceeding 
selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars  and may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
other income  net other income  net represents interest income from short term investments  interest expense on short and long term obligations and gain on the sale of long term investments 
other income  net was approximately million for fiscal  approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal constituting approximately  and of the respective fiscal year s net revenues 
the net increase in other income  net for fiscal is primarily the result of a million net gain on the sale of million shares of usc  which was partially offset by a million reduction in the carrying value of the company s investment in maverick networks 
provision for income taxes during the first quarter of fiscal the company wrote off deferred taxes of million due to net operating losses 
the company s effective tax rate was for fiscal year and for fiscal years and the effective tax rate for fiscal years and represented tax benefits accrued at applicable statutory rates 
equity in income of usc as discussed in the section below entitled liquidity and capital resources  the company entered into an agreement with other parties to form a separate taiwanese company  usc 
this investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting with a ninety day lag in reporting the company s share of results for the entity 
equity in income of usc reflects the company s share of income earned by usc for the previous quarter 
in fiscal  the company reported its share in the income of usc in the amount of million  as compared to million reported in fiscal the decrease in income is primarily due to lower net income and a decrease in the company s ownership percentage from approximately to 
the company s share of usc s income in fiscal was not a material amount and was therefore not recorded 
impact of year issues the company uses a number of computer software programs and operating systems and intelligent hardware devices in its internal operations  including information technology it and non it systems used in the design  manufacture and marketing of company products 
these items are considered to be year objects and to the extent that these objects are unable to correctly recognize and process date dependent information beyond the year  some level of modification or replacement is necessary 
most computer programs were designed to perform data computations on the last two digits of the numerical value of a year 
when a computation referencing the year is performed  these systems may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
computations referencing the year might be invoked at any time  but are likely to begin occurring in the year the company is currently conducting a company wide year readiness assessment and has recently completed implementing a new management information system which the company believes is year compliant 
during fiscal years and  the company spent approximately million in connection with implementing the new information systems 
the company does not anticipate that it will incur material expenditures for the resolution of any year issues relating to its it or non it systems 
the company could possibly be materially adversely impacted by the year issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  subcontractors  customers  vendors  and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
the company is in the process of determining the impact of the company s operations as a result of the year readiness of these third parties 
in the event issues relating to key customers and suppliers are not successfully resolved  based on information available to us at present  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worse case scenario is a temporary disruption in infrastructure service  which could adversely impact supplier deliveries or customer shipments 
if severe disruptions occur in these areas and are not corrected in a timely manner  a revenue or profit shortfall may result in fiscal year the company is in the process of assessing year readiness of its major suppliers and vendors and is in the process of developing a contingency plan  which it expects to complete by september  at which time the company will be able to evaluate its most reasonable likely worst case year scenarios 
year compliance issues could have a significant impact on the company s operations and its financial results if the new information systems are not completely implemented in a timely manner  unforeseen needs or problems arise  or  if the systems operated by the company s customers  vendors or subcontractors are not year compliant 
the dates on which the company believes its year readiness will be completed are based on the company s management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of year compliant solutions 
specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced  and similar uncertainties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties and the interconnection of global businesses  the company cannot ensure its ability to timely and cost effectively resolve problems associated with the year issue that may affect its operations and business  or expose it to third party liability 
factors that may affect future results the company s quarterly and annual operating results have historically been  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  anticipated and unanticipated decreases in unit average selling prices of the company s products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  seasonal customer demand  and the timing of significant orders 
operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending  a downturn in the market for personal computers  or order cancellations or rescheduling 
additionally  because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development to be able to support increased sales levels  the company s operating results will be adversely affected if such increased sales levels are not achieved 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  product obsolescence and significant price competition and  as a result  are subject to decreases in average selling prices 
the company has experienced significant deterioration in the average selling prices for its sram and dram products during the past years 
the company is unable to predict when or if such decline in prices will stabilize 
historically  average selling prices for semiconductor memory products have declined and the company expects that average selling prices will decline in the future 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent on its ability to increase unit sales volume of existing products and to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products 
declining average selling prices will also adversely affect the company s gross margins unless the company is able to significantly reduce its cost per unit in an amount to offset the declines in average selling prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase unit sales volumes of existing products  develop  introduce and sell new products or significantly reduce its cost per unit 
there also can be no assurance that even if the company were to increase unit sales volumes and sufficiently reduce its costs per unit  the company would be able to maintain or increase revenues or gross margins 
the company usually ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with shipments in the third month higher at the end of the month 
this pattern  which is common in the semiconductor industry  is likely to continue 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to be more difficult to predict 
moreover  a disruption in the company s production or shipping near the end of a quarter could materially reduce the company s net sales for that quarter 
the company s reliance on outside foundries and independent assembly and testing houses reduces the company s ability to control  among other things  delivery schedules 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry periodically results in shortages of advanced process wafer fabrication capacity such as the company has experienced from time to time 
the company s ability to maintain adequate levels of inventory is primarily dependent upon the company obtaining sufficient supply of products to meet future demand  and any inability of the company to maintain adequate inventory levels may adversely affect its relations with its customers 
in addition  the company must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of products shipments  and there is a risk that because demand for the company s products is volatile and subject to rapid technology and price change  the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because certain of the company s key customers place orders with short lead times 
the company s customers ability to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect the company s liquidity  as the company may be unable to adjust its purchases from its independent foundries to match such customer changes and cancellations 
the company has in the past produced excess quantities of certain products  which has had a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company in the future will not produce excess quantities of any of its products 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  the company s operating results could be adversely affected  as was the case in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  when the company recorded pre tax charges totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively  primarily to reflect a decline in market value of certain inventory 
the company currently relies on independent and joint venture foundries to manufacture all of the company s products 
reliance on these foundries involves several risks  including constraints or delays in timely delivery of the company s products  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs and loss of production due to seismic activity  weather conditions and other factors 
in or about october  a fire caused extensive damage to united integrated circuits corporation uicc  a foundry joint venture between umc and various companies 
uicc is located next to usic and near usc and umc in the hsin chu science based industrial park 
the company has products manufactured at umc and usc  and owns equity stakes in usc and usic 
uicc suffered an additional fire in january  and since october  there have been at least two other fires at semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the hsin chu science based industrial park 
there can be no assurance that fires or other disasters will not have a material adverse affect on umc  usc or usic in the future 
in addition  as a result of the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry based in the hsin chu science based industrial park  severe constraints have been placed on the water and electricity supply in that region 
any shortages of water or electricity could adversely affect the company s foundries ability to supply the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
although the company continuously evaluates sources of supply and may seek to add additional foundry capacity  there can be no assurance that such additional capacity can be obtained at acceptable prices  if at all 
the occurrence of any supply or other problem resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  as was the case during the third quarter of fiscal  during which period manufacturing yields of one of the company s products were materially adversely affected by manufacturing problems at one of the company s foundry suppliers 
there can be no assurance that other problems affecting manufacturing yields of the company s products will not occur in the future 
there is an ongoing risk that the suppliers of wafer fabrication  wafer sort  assembly and test services to the company may increase the price charged to the company for the services they provide  to the point that the company may not be able to profitably have its products produced at such suppliers 
the occurrence of such price increases could have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results 
the company conducts a significant portion of its business internationally and is subject to a number of risks resulting from such operations 
such risks include political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  foreign currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
because the company conducts most of its manufacturing operations in asia  and receives a significant amount of its net revenue from sales to asian customers  the foregoing risks heightened in light of the recent financial and economic crisis in asia 
current or potential customers of the company in asia  for instance  may become unwilling or unable to purchase the company s products  and the company s asian competitors may be able to become more price competitive relative to the company due to declining values of their national currencies 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact the company s operating results in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
additionally  other factors may materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company relies on domestic and offshore subcontractors for die assembly and testing of products  and is subject to risks of disruption in adequate supply of such services and quality problems with such services 
the company is subject to the risks of shortages of goods or services and increases in the cost of raw materials used in the manufacture or assembly of the company s products 
the company faces intense competition  and many of its principal competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than does the company  any of which factors may place such competitors and potential competitors in a stronger competitive position than the company 
the company s corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake faults  and the company is subject to the risk of damage or disruption in the event of seismic activity 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
in  the company adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances  excluding transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners 
in  the company adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise  and replaces the industry segment approach with the management approach 
the management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of a company s reportable segments 
sfas no 
also requires disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect results of operations or financial position or the segments we reported in and in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
it further provides criteria for derivative instruments to be designated as fair value  cash flow and foreign currency hedges  and establishes respective accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of the instruments 
the statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we will be required to adjust hedging instruments to fair value in the balance sheet  and recognize the offsetting gain or loss as transition adjustments to be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  and presented in a manner similar to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we believe the adoption of this statement will not have a significant effect on our results of operations 
current pending litigation  administrative proceedings and claims are set forth in item legal proceedings and in item licenses  patents and maskwork protection  above 
the company intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation and claims and  subject to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and based upon discovery completed to date  management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
however  should the outcome of any of these actions be unfavorable  the company may be required to pay damages and other expenses  or may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling any products deemed to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
moreover  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company has from time to time received  and believes that it likely will in the future receive  notices alleging that the company s products  or the processes used to manufacture the company s products  infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  and the company is subject to the risk that it may become party to litigation involving such claims the company currently is involved in patent litigation 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims such as the current patent litigation  or claims against the company for indemnification related to such third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from other matters 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  depending upon the number of infringing products and the extent of sales of such products  the company could suffer significant monetary damages 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the company s failure to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company also  as a result of an antidumping proceeding commenced in february  must pay a cash deposit equal to of the entered value of any srams manufactured wafer fabrication in taiwan  in order to import such goods into the us although the company may be refunded such deposits in the future see item legal proceedings  above  the deposit requirement  and the potential that all entries of taiwan fabricated srams from october  through march  will be liquidated at the bond rate or deposit rate in effect at the time of entry  may materially adversely affect the company s ability to sell in the united states srams manufactured wafer fabrication in taiwan 
the company manufactures wafer fabrication srams in singapore and has manufactured srams in japan as well  and may be able to support its us customers with such products  which are not subject to antidumping duties 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to do so 
in october  micron technology  inc filed an antidumping petition with the doc and the itc  alleging that dynamic random access memories drams fabricated in taiwan are being sold in the united states at less than fair value  and that the united states industry producing drams is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports of drams fabricated in taiwan 
the petition requests the united states government to impose antidumping duties on imports into the united states of drams fabricated in taiwan 
a material portion of the drams designed and sold by the company are fabricated in taiwan 
the company received preliminary producer and importer questionnaires from the itc  and submitted responses to such questionnaires in november in december  the itc preliminarily determined that there is a reasonable indication that the imports of the products under investigation are injuring the united states industry 
the company received a questionnaire from the doc  and responded to such questionnaire in accordance with the established deadline 
in january  the doc decided to limit the number of respondents investigated and notified alliance that it would not be separately investigated 
in may the doc issued a preliminary affirmative determination of dumping 
under that determination  the company s imports into the united states on or after approximately may  of drams fabricated in taiwan are subject to an antidumping duty deposit in the amount of the preliminary all others rate of the entered value of such drams  an antidumping margin calculated by weight averaging the antidumping margins of individually investigated respondent companies 
the company will post a bond to cover deposits on such entries 
the doc is currently scheduled to complete its investigation by late if the doc final determination of dumping and the itc final determination of injury are affirmative  the doc will issue an antidumping duty order 
under any such order  the company s imports of taiwan fabricated drams into the united states on or after the date the order is published will be subject to a cash deposit in the amount of the final all others rate of the entered value of such drams 
if either agency s final determination is negative  the investigation will be terminated  the suspension of liquidation lifted  and the bond released 
if an antidumping order is issued  in late the company will have an opportunity to request a review of its sales of taiwan fabricated drams from approximately may through november the review period 
if the company makes such a request  the amount of antidumping duties  if any  owed on entries during the review period will remain undetermined until the conclusion of the review in late  which would determine a company specific antidumping duty margin 
if the doc found  based upon analysis of the company s sales during the review period  that antidumping duties either should not be imposed or should be imposed at a lower rate than the final all others rate determined in the original investigation  the difference between the cash deposits made by the company  and the deposits that would have been made had the lower rate or no rate  as the case may be been in effect  would be returned to the company  with interest 
if  on the other hand  the doc found a higher company specific margin  the company would have to pay the difference between the cash deposits paid by the company and the deposits that would have been made had the higher rate been in effect  with interest 
a material portion of the drams designed and sold by the company are fabricated in taiwan  and the cash deposit requirement and possibility of assessment of antidumping duties could materially adversely affect the company s ability to sell taiwan fabricated drams in the united states and have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company has made and will continue to make investments in emerging  high technology companies such as maverick networks and others 
there is no guarantee that these companies will be successful or that the company will recover its investments 
as a result of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  stock prices for many technology companies are subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
if revenues or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community  there could be an immediate and significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities used cash of approximately million in fiscal  versus generating cash of approximately million in fiscal  and using approximately million in fiscal cash utilized in operations in fiscal was primarily the result of net loss generated during the period 
cash generated by operations in fiscal was the result of a tax refund and changes in working capital accounts offset by a net loss incurred during the fiscal year 
cash utilized in operations in fiscal was the result of an operating loss and an increase in working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in fiscal versus cash used in investment activities of million in fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal included equipment purchases of approximately million  investments in usic of approximately million  and proceeds from the sale of usc shares of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal reflect equipment purchases of approximately million and an equity investment in usc of approximately million  while net cash used in investing activities during fiscal including equipment purchases of approximately million and an equity investment in usc of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily reflects a decrease in restricted cash of approximately million  partially offset by the reduction of long term debt obligations of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal  reflects receipt of approximately million from issuance of common stock upon exercise of options pursuant to the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans  partially offset by the reduction of a long term debt obligation of approximately million and an increase in restricted cash of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal generated through financing activities resulting from proceeds of a secured loan of approximately million and proceeds of approximately million through issuance of common stock upon exercise of options under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans  partially offset by an increase in restricted cash of approximately million 
at april   the company had approximately million in cash  an increase of approximately million from march   and working capital of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from march  the company believes that these sources of liquidity  and financing opportunities the company believes will be available to it  will be sufficient to meet its projected working capital and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  the formation of joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or the usage of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investments  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
additionally  the company has entered into and will continue to enter into various transactions  including the licensing of its integrated circuit designs in exchange for royalties  fees or guarantees of manufacturing capacity 
in february  the company agreed to purchase shares of chartered for approximately us million and entered into a manufacturing agreement under which chartered will provide a minimum number of wafers from its inch wafer fabrication facility known as fab in april  the company agreed to purchase additional shares in chartered  bringing the total agreed investment in chartered to approximately us million and chartered agreed to provide an increased minimum number of wafers to be provided by chartered from fab the company has paid all installments to chartered

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and changes in market values of our investments 
these investments operate in markets that have experienced significant exchange rate fluctuations over the year ended march  these entities  in which we hold varying percentage interests  operate and sell their products in various global markets  however  the majority of their sales are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  their foreign currency risk is reduced 
we did not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes as of march  investment risk as of march   our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
foreign currency risk based on our overall currency rate exposure at march   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the value of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future
