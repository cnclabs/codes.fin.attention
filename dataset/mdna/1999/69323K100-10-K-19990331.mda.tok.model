in july  the company announced its plan to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock 
the shares will be repurchased from time to time at prevailing market prices  through open market or negotiated transactions  depending upon market conditions 
no limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that the company will repurchase 
subject to applicable securities laws  repurchases may be made at such times and in such amounts as the company s management deems appropriate 
the program can also be discontinued at any time management feels additional purchases are not warranted 
the company will finance the repurchase plan with existing working capital 
as of december   the company has repurchased  shares 
as part of its growth strategy  the company may  in the future  acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business 
any such acquisition and the ensuing integration of the operations of the acquired company with those of the company would place additional demands on the company s management  operating and financial resources 
the company currently has no definitive agreements with respect to any acquisitions 
year computer systems  software packages  and microprocessor dependent equipment may cease to function or generate erroneous data when the year arrives 
the problem affects those systems or products that are programmed to accept a two digit code in date code fields 
to correctly identify the year  a four digit date code field will be required to be what is commonly termed year compliant 
the company may realize exposure and risk if the systems for which it is dependent upon to conduct day to day operations are not year compliant 
the potential areas of exposure include electronic data exchange systems operated by third parties with whom the company transacts business  certain products purchased from third parties for resale  and computers  software  telephone systems  and other equipment used internally 
to minimize the potential adverse affects of the year problem  the company has established an internal project team comprised of all functional disciplines 
this project team has begun a three phase process of identifying internal systems both information technology and non information technology systems not year compliant  determining their significance in the effective operation of the company  and developing plans to resolve the issues where necessary 
the company has been communicating with the suppliers and others to coordinate year readiness 
the responses received by the company to date have indicated that steps are currently being undertaken to address this concern 
however  if such third parties are not able to make all systems and products year compliant  there could be a material adverse impact on the company 
initial review of the company s principal application software through which nearly all of the company s business is transacted  has determined it to be year compliant and  as such  the company does not anticipate any material adverse operational issues to arise 
the company has completed of the year compliance assessment for critical systems and will complete its assessment by the end of the second quarter of the company plans to implement corrective solutions before the end of the third quarter of to date  the costs incurred by the company with respect to this project are million 
based on current estimates  management expects that the company s total costs in connection with its year compliance project will be approximately million and will be financed from general corporate funds  however  future anticipated costs are difficult to estimate with any certainty and may differ materially from those currently projected based on the results of the assessment phase of the company s year project 
the anticipated costs associated with the company s year compliance program do not include time and costs that may be incurred as a result of any potential failure of third parties to become year compliant or costs to implement the company s future contingency plans 
management estimates that approximately one half of the expected costs will be attributed to the redeployment of internal resources and the other half will be comprised principally of external consulting fees and software upgrades 
no hardware expenditures for year are contemplated 
the redeployment of internal data processing resources is not expected to materially delay any significant projects 
year spending is expected to be of total budgeted data processing expenditures 
the company has not yet developed a contingency plan in the event that any non compliant critical systems are not remedied by january   nor has it formulated a timetable to create such contingency plan 
upon completion of this project  if systems material to the company s operations have not been made year compliant  or if third parties fail to make their systems year compliant in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results  and the company does not expect it to have such an impact in the near future 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company s business will not be so affected by inflation 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of ubid is contained in the ubid k in part ii  item and is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash and long term debt 
at march   the carrying values of the company s financial instruments approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates 
it is the company s policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
the company does not have any significant foreign currency exposure since it does not transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  the company does not have significant overall currency exposure at march
