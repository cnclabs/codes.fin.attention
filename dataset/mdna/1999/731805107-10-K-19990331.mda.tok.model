this includes the estimated costs of severance pay and benefits and the write down of assets to net realizable value 
liquidity and capital resources acquisition and ongoing working capital financing polyvision believes its credit facilities  combined with cash flows generated from current operations  are adequate to meet polyvision s current and anticipated liquidity needs for at least the next months 
financing for the alliance purchase  and for polyvision s ongoing working capital requirements  was and will be provided through o senior credit facilities provided by fleet national bank and kbc bank  nv  in the maximum aggregate principal amount of  the senior credit facilities  o a  senior subordinated loan provided by john hancock mutual life insurance company and certain of its affiliates the subordinated loan  and o the purchase by alpine of  of series c preferred stock of polyvision 
the senior credit facilities consist of a a revolving line of credit in the maximum principal amount of  of which  is available in the united states  and  is available to polyvision s european subsidiaries  b term loans the tranche a loans in the aggregate principal amount of  of which  was loaned in the united states  and  was loaned in europe  and c an additional term loan the tranche b loan in the principal amount of  all of which was loaned in the united states 
advances under the revolving line of credit will be available through november   and borrowings thereunder may not at any time exceed for the united states borrowers  an amount equal to the lesser of  or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable plus of eligible inventory  and for the european borrowers  the lesser of  or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory 
the term loans are repayable in quarterly principal installments through october  in the case of the tranche a loans and october  in the case of the tranche b loan  and such principal installments have been weighted so that the majority of payments do not come due until the later years including a  balloon payment under the tranche b loan due on october  
polyvision has the option of selecting interest rates on these loans based on either the announced prime rate of interest or the prevailing libor rate  and the rate of interest in effect at any time will be dependent upon polyvision s ratio of consolidated indebtedness to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from time to time 
the tranche a loan and tranche b loan are subject to mandatory prepayment to the extent of net unreinvested proceeds of certain asset sales and proceeds of certain future debt issuances by polyvision  and out of a portion of annual excess cash flow and net proceeds of certain future equity issuances by polyvision 
the senior credit facilities are secured by liens and security interests on substantially all of polyvision s real and personal property  including the assets of polyvision s subsidiaries and a pledge of the outstanding stock of such subsidiaries  and by cross guarantees by polyvision and its subsidiaries

polyvision will also be prohibited from paying any dividends on its common stock without the lenders prior written consent  and from paying dividends on its preferred stock until such time as polyvision reduces its ratio of total debt to ebitda to certain prescribed levels 
the lenders have reserved the right to declare all of these loans to be immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of certain customary events of default  including non payment of principal or interest  bankruptcy  insolvency  default on other material indebtedness  and other material adverse developments or occurrences relating to polyvision 
the senior subordinated loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable quarterly in arrears  and matures as to all principal in a single installment on december   subject to mandatory prepayment at the option of the lender at of the principal balance together with accrued interest upon a change of control of polyvision 
except for the guaranty thereof by polyvision s domestic subsidiaries  the senior subordinated loan is an unsecured obligation of polyvision 
the loan agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants  financial covenants similar to but less stringent than the financial covenants applicable to the senior credit facilities  and customary events of default 
the senior subordinated loan is junior in right of payment to the senior credit facilities  but senior in right of payment to the  promissory note issued by polyvision to the sellers as part of the purchase price in the alliance acquisition 
in conjunction with the borrowing of the senior subordinated loan  polyvision issued to the lender detachable warrants entitling the holder thereof to purchase  for nominal consideration   shares of common stock of polyvision  representing approximately of the fully diluted common stock of polyvision 
polyvision has agreed to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering the shares of common stock underlying the warrants  to enable the resale of such shares to the public  by no later than april  and to use its best efforts to make such registration statement effective by no later than june  immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the acquisition  all of the tranche a loans and the tranche b loan under the senior credit facilities  and the entire senior subordinated loan  had been borrowed and were outstanding 
in addition  approximately  of borrowings were outstanding under the european portion of the revolving credit facilities  and no amounts were outstanding under the united states portion of the revolving credit facilities 
as of december   polyvision s cash position totaled  an increase of  over the balance as of april  most of the increase was due to the cash at alliance on the purchase date combined with the proceeds remaining from the financing of the acquisition discussed above 
for the eight month period ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities totaled  during this period  polyvision experienced a decrease in trade accounts receivable  net of effects from the purchase of alliance  of  over the balance as of april   principally due to the seasonality of polyvision s business  which is normally more active during the summer months 
also  polyvision experienced a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  net of effects from the purchase of alliance  of  compared with the april  balance 
this decline was also due to business seasonality 
exchange transaction and alpine financing in may  polyvision entered into an agreement with alpine  polyvision s largest single shareholder  pursuant to which polyvision had the right to borrow  prior to may   up to  from alpine to be used by polyvision to fund its working capital needs  including research  development and commercialization activities in connection with the flat panel display technology of apv  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of polyvision 
borrowings under the agreement were unsecured and accrued interest at a market rate reflecting alpine s cost of borrowing such funds then approximately  with interest payable semiannually in cash 
the principal balance was due on may   subject to mandatory prepayment of principal and interest  in whole or in part  from the net cash proceeds of any public or private equity or debt financing received by polyvision at any time before maturity 
in april  polyvision entered into a second agreement with alpine to borrow  to fund its corporate borrowing requirements 
borrowings under this agreement were also at alpine s cost of borrowing such funds 
polyvision had historically relied upon the support of alpine to meet its working capital needs and financial commitments 
in november  all indebtedness of polyvision due alpine was exchanged for shares of polyvision common stock and series b preferred stock and is no longer outstanding 
effects of inflation inflation remains at a low rate and is not expected to have a significant effect on polyvision in the near term 
year compliance overview the year yk problem is the result of computer programs having been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  thus not properly recognizing dates after december  the six digit date yymmdd has become the standard for date representations and is embedded in a multitude of computer programs and computer chips 
information technology it hardware  embedded technology  such as microprocessors  or software that is date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system and mechanical failures 
polyvision does not manufacture or sell products with embedded technology 
during  polyvision began identifying and resolving year issues 
these efforts include identification and review of internal operating systems and applications  and customer projects and services  as well as discussions with information providers and other key suppliers to the business 
at this time  based upon the efforts taken to date and those yet to be taken  polyvision does not expect any serious disruptions in its business operations and  therefore  does not anticipate any material negative effect upon its revenues or earnings as a result of the yk issue 
remediation costs for problems identified thus far are not expected to be material to polyvision s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
polyvision has established a timetable for resolving year issues so as not to interrupt ongoing operations 
polyvision s state of readiness the year project plan  including assessment  improvement  testing and implementation has been established 
the assessment phase is complete and should be completed in may upon receipt of all remaining vendor and supplier yk readiness inquiries 
assessment of the year compliance of third parties with whom polyvision has material relationships is in process 
polyvision s material third party relationships include the following a raw material vendors polyvision s raw material purchases are through third party raw material vendors 
most mission critical raw material vendors have responded to polyvision s yk readiness inquiry  b equipment vendors the response to the yk readiness inquiries from equipment vendors  which includes all embedded chip equipment  is complete  c service providers the response to the yk readiness inquiries from third party service providers  which includes utilities  phone service and all facility related services  is complete  and d software vendors polyvision has upgraded most purchased software to yk compliant version and is in the testing phase 
the responses received  thus far  from polyvision s third party vendors and suppliers indicate compliance on or before october  the preliminary assessment of internal it and non it systems has been completed 
internal non complaint items have been identified and prioritization of internal non compliant items is in process 
a system for tracking remediation has been established and non compliant items identified are expected to be completed in april based on the findings of the planning and assessment phases completed to date  polyvision does not believe independent verification and validation processes will be necessary 
costs to address polyvision s year issues the current estimate of the cost of remediation and equipment and software replacement is approximately  and is summarized below 
polyvision is installing a new computer system at its manufacturing facility in france and denmark 
the cost of computer hardware software for these locations will approximate  and  respectively 
polyvision s computer system in belgium is being upgraded to adequately handle the year compliance issues  at an approximate cost of  management believes its other computer systems are year compliant 
risks of polyvision s year issues and polyvision s contingency plans a reasonable worst case yk scenario is not known at this time 
this determination will be made after the receipt of the remaining material third party questionnaires 
however  the shipment of product to customers is expected to continue with minimal interruption and no material loss of revenues is anticipated 
the yk project has had minimal impact on the schedule of other major it projects 
polyvision has not completed a contingency plan  however  it will by may each manufacturing facility will incorporate year into their existing disaster contingency plan 
the contingency plan will ensure that i adequate levels of inventory will be on hand to mitigate the impact of any potential short term disruptions in production  ii adequate supply of raw materials will be available from alternate sources  and iii the necessary backup measures for computer processing are identified 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset  or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
polyvision will be required to adopt the new statement in polyvision has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas no 
and has not determined the method of adoption 
however  sfas no 
could increase the volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
effective december   polyvision adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which requires disclosures regarding polyvision s comprehensive income defined as the total of net income and all other non owner changes in equity  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which revises disclosure requirements related to segment reporting 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
require disclosure only  therefore their adoption had no impact on polyvision s financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency with the purchase of alliance  polyvision has foreign based operations  primarily in europe  which it anticipates will account for approximately of its sales during calendar in the conduct of its foreign operations  polyvision makes intercompany sales principally between its european subsidiaries 
these transactions are primarily denominated in belgian and french francs  the functional currencies of polyvision s major european subsidiaries 
polyvision does not have a significant amount of intercompany sales between its european and us businesses  and does not routinely transfer funds between its domestic and foreign operations 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based largely on polyvision s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  certain of which are beyond polyvision s control 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements as a result of  among other factors  risks related to polyvision s history of operating losses and accumulated deficit  future capital requirements  competition  technical advances and seasonality  environmental matters  dependence on the construction market generally  and other risks 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the forward looking information contained in this report will in fact occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk polyvision s exposure to market risk primarily relates to interest rates on long term debt 
for example  a one percent increase in interest rates affecting polyvision s floating rate debt would increase the interest expense during the eight months ended december  by approximately  and polyvision s budgeted interest expense for the year ending december  by approximately
