at december  and the company had a net balance of capitalized software development costs of  and million  respectively 
the company intends to continue making significant expenditures on research and development to develop new products and expand the platforms and operating systems on which its products are offered 
while the company believes that these current research and development expenditures will be beneficial in the long term development of its business  there can be no assurance that the development of products will be successful or will not be rendered obsolete by future technology acquisitions or developments 
research and development expenditures are incurred substantially in advance of related revenue and in some cases do not result in the generation of revenue 
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in expenses in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million reflecting growth in sales headcount from to  an increase in sales commissions of million attributable to higher revenue  an increase in facilities and related costs of million and an increase in spending on marketing programs of million

see note to notes to consolidated financial statements provision for income taxes the company participates in special programs sponsored by the government of israel relating to taxation  contributing to significantly lower income tax expense than expected based on the us federal income tax rate 
future provisions for taxes will depend upon the mix of worldwide income and the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions 
in the and tax provisions  the company has not fully recognized the tax benefit associated with the write off of in process technology and related expenses because realization of the future tax benefit is uncertain 
net income the company reported net income of million in  compared to net income of million in and million in in  the results of operations were impacted by the acquisition of certain technologies which resulted in a one time charge for write off of in process research and development and related costs of million 
the company s operating expenses are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenues  and expenses are generally incurred in advance of revenues 
the company plans to continue to expand and increase its operating expenses to support anticipated revenue growth if revenues do not materialize in a forward looking statement quarter as expected  the company s results from operations for that quarter are likely to be materially adversely affected 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue because only a small portion of the company s expenses varies with its revenue 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results to date 
year the approach of year presents significant issues for many computer systems  since much of the software in use today may not accurately process data beyond the company is in the process of conducting an internal review of most of its internal corporate headquarters computer systems and software it systems including finance  human resources  intranet applications  payroll systems and customer support organization systems to determine their year compliance 
as part of this process  the company is contacting vendors of its relevant corporate it systems to determine potential exposure to year issues and will be obtaining written assurance from such vendors regarding year compliance 
although the company believes that most of its principal corporate it systems are year compliant  the company has not yet completed its assessment and testing of these systems 
at this time  the company has not determined the state of compliance of certain third party suppliers of services such as phone companies  long distance carriers  financial institutions and electric companies 
the failure of any one of these third party suppliers could severely disrupt the company s ability to carry on its business as well as disrupt the business of the company s customers 
the company is in the process of polling these companies in order to determine their state of compliance and their contingency plans 
failure of the company to provide year compliant business solutions to its customers or to receive such business solutions from its suppliers could result in liability to the company or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
furthermore  the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products and services such as those offered by the company  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company could be affected through disruptions in the operation of the enterprises with which the company interacts or from general widespread problems or an economic crisis resulting from noncompliant year systems 
despite the company s efforts to address the year effect on its internal systems and business operations  such effect could result in a material disruption of its business or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has just begun the process of developing a contingency plan to respond to any of the foregoing consequences of internal and external failures to be year compliant 
in selling its products  the company frequently relies on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees 
the provisions in such licenses limiting the company s exposure to potential product liability claims may therefore be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
further  the company s license agreements typically contain a representation that the software is year compliant through its description of specifically how the company s products process the year calendar dates 
while the company believes its products are year compliant  the risk of year noncompliance claims may increase as december  approaches and passes 
the company currently carries errors and omissions insurance against such claims  however  there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such insurance will provide the company with adequate protection against any such claims 
although the company has not experienced any product liability or other year claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of such claims 
a significant product liability claim against the company would have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results the company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of those risks and uncertainties which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form k 
the company has identified certain forward looking statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with a footnote symbol 
the company may also make oral forward looking statements from time to time 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
the market for software products is generally characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
to maintain its competitive position  the company must continue to develop and introduce in a timely and cost effective manner enhancements to its existing and new products that keep pace with technological developments and achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new products or enhancements successfully  that any such new products or enhancements will gain market acceptance  or that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter technical or other difficulties that could delay introduction of new products in the future 
if the company is unable to introduce new products or enhancements and respond to industry changes on a timely basis  its business could be materially adversely affected 
the company s current products and products under development are limited in number and concentrated exclusively in the automated software testing market 
this market has experienced rapid worldwide growth  and it remains relatively new and not well penetrated 
although the company believes that the current trend toward increased use of automated software testing will continue  there can be no assurance that the automated software testing market will continue to expand or that the company s products will be accepted in any expanded market 
price reductions or declines in demand for the company s software testing products  whether as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company may from time to time experience significant fluctuation in quarterly operating results due to a variety of factors  some of which are outside of the company s control 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are based on sales forecasts 
products are generally shipped as orders are received  and  consequently  quarterly sales and operating results depend primarily on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
in particular  the company has historically received a substantial portion of its orders at the end of a quarter  up to the last few days of a quarter 
if an unanticipated order shortfall occurs at the end of a quarter  the company s operating results for the quarter could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  product orders are affected by the buying patterns of customers 
the buying trends of customers are further impacted by internal budgetary considerations relating to year remediation or euro conversion efforts 
all of the foregoing may result in unanticipated quarterly earning shortfalls or losses 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the computer software market is intensely competitive 
the company continues to face direct competition mainly from well established  publicly held companies 
there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position if any of the major software manufacturers  which have forward looking statement significantly greater financial and technical resources than the company  decided to devote substantial resources to entering the software testing market or if there is an increase in developing testing utilities internally by the company s customers or potential customers 
a variety of external and internal factors could materially adversely affect the company s ability to compete 
these include the relative functionality  price  performance and reliability of the products offered by the company and its competitors  the timing and success of new product development or enhancement efforts of the company and its competitors  and the effectiveness of the marketing and sales efforts of the company and its competitors 
the company expects to face increasing competition in the automated software testing market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company has derived a substantial portion of its revenues from sales of its products through alternate distribution channels such as referral partners  system integrators  and value added resellers 
the company expects that sales of its products through its alternate distribution channels will continue to account for a substantial portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
each of the company s system integrators and value added resellers can cease marketing the company s products with limited notice and with little or no penalty 
there can be no assurance that the company s system integrators and value added resellers will continue to offer the company s products or that the company will be able to recruit additional or replacement system integrators and value added resellers 
the loss of one or more of the company s major system integrators and value added resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s system integrators and value added resellers also offer competitive products manufactured by third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company s system integrators and value added resellers will give priority to the marketing of the company s products as compared to its competitors products 
any reduction or delay in sales of the company s products by its system integrators and value added resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales to customers located outside the united states have historically accounted for a significant percentage of revenue and the company anticipates that such sales will continue to be a significant percentage of the company s total revenue 
accordingly  such factors as currency fluctuations  political and economic instability and trade restrictions could have a negative impact on the company s financial performance 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  the company s primary exposure related to non dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in europe and australia 
as the company expands its operations in europe and the pacific rim  the company expects to see an increase in exposures related to non dollar denominated sales 
the company attempts to limit foreign exchange exposure by operational strategies and  on a limited basis  by using forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany trade balances 
these efforts depend upon estimates of transaction activities in various currencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in making these estimates 
to the extent these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated material currency gains or losses 
the company s stock price  has been and will continue to be  subject to significant volatility 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
if revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet expectations of the investment community  there could be an immediate and significant impact on the company s stock price 
in addition  the company s stock price may be impacted by events or broader market trends that are unrelated to the company s operating results 
as part of its growth strategy  the company may  from time to time  acquire or invest in complimentary businesses  products or technologies 
while there are currently no commitments with respect to any particular forward looking statement acquisition or investment  the company s management frequently evaluates the strategic opportunity available related to complimentary businesses  products or technologies 
the process of integrating an acquired company s business into the company s operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of the company s business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment will be realized 
future acquisitions or investments by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
since its inception  the company has obtained royalty bearing grants from various israeli government agencies 
the company received and recognized million in such grants during  however  it has not applied nor does it currently anticipate applying for future grants 
the company believes these grants are no longer needed to subsidize the company s research and development projects 
the terms of certain grants prohibit the manufacture of products developed under these grants outside of israel and the transfer of technology developed pursuant to the terms of these grants to any person  without the prior written consent of the government of israel 
as a result  if the company is unable to obtain the consent of the government of israel  the company may not be able to take advantage of strategic manufacturing and other opportunities outside of israel 
since  the company has experienced significant annual increases in revenue 
this growth has placed and  if it continues  will place a significant strain on the company s management  resources and operations 
to accommodate its recent growth  the company has been implementing a variety of new or expanded business and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of its accounting and other internal management systems 
there can be no assurance that the implementation of such systems  procedures and controls can be completed successfully  or without disruption of the company s operations 
if the company s growth continues  the company will be required to hire and integrate substantial numbers of new employees 
the market has become increasingly competitive both in the united states and internationally and may require the company to pay higher salaries 
the company s failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s success depends to a significant extent on the performance of its senior management and certain key employees 
competition for highly skilled employees  including sales  technical and management personnel  is intense in the computer industry 
the company s continued success depends in significant part on its ability to attract additional qualified employees and to retain the services of current key employees 
in particular  the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company currently relies on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its products 
the company presently has one registered copyright 
the company holds four patents for elements contained in certain of its products  and it has filed several other us and foreign patent applications on various elements of its products 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s patent applications will result in an issued patent or that  if issued  such patent would be upheld if challenged 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
there can also be no assurance that the measures taken by the company to protect its propriety rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
in addition  the laws of various countries in which the company s products may be sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert intellectual property infringement claims against the company or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into royalty or cross license arrangements or result in costly litigation 
forward looking statement in selling its products  the company frequently relies on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees 
the provisions in such licenses limiting the company s exposure to potential product liability claims may therefore be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
further  the company s license agreements typically contain a representation that the software is year compliant through its description of specifically how the company s products process the year calendar dates 
while the company believes its products are year compliant  the risk of year noncompliance claims may increase as december  approaches and passes 
the company currently carries errors and omissions insurance against such claims  however  there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such insurance will provide the company with adequate protection against any such claims 
although the company has not experienced any product liability or other year claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of such claims 
a significant product liability claim against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the approach of year presents significant issues for many computer systems  since much of the software in use today may not accurately process data beyond the company is in the process of conducting an internal review of most of its internal corporate headquarters computer systems and software it systems including finance  human resources  intranet applications  payroll systems and customer support organization systems to determine their year compliance

the company has begun the process of developing a contingency plan to respond to any of the foregoing consequences of internal and external failures to be year compliant 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of those assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
a change in the facts and circumstances surrounding these estimates could result in a change to the estimates and impact future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s principle source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and investments as compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the december  balance included million of short term and million of long term investments in high quality government and corporate securities 
during  the company generated million cash from operating activities  compared to cash generated from operating activities of million in and cash used for operating activities of million in the increase in compared to was due primarily to an increase in net income  an increase in deferred revenue  and increases in accrued liabilities and income taxes payable

new accounting pronouncements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued a statement of position  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop is effective for the financial statements for years beginning after december  sop provides guidance over accounting for computer software developed or obtained for internal use including the requirement to capitalize specified costs and amortization of such costs 
the company will adopt the provisions of sop in its fiscal year ending december   and does not expect such adoption to have a material effect on the company s financial statements

forward looking statement item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer 
at december   million of the company s cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio carried a maturity of less than days  and million carried a maturity of less than one year 
all investments mature  by policy  in less than two years 
the company has the ability and intent to hold the portfolio to maturity 
the effect of a rate decline would not have a material effect on the portfolio 
information about the company s investment portfolio is set forth in footnote of item a of this form k and is incorporated herein by reference 
foreign currency risk 
the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe and the pacific rim 
accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s operating expenses in each of these countries are in the local currencies  which mitigates a significant portion of the exposure related to local currency revenues 
in addition  the company uses forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany trade payables 
the company has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s accounting policies for these contracts are based on the company s designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria the company uses for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of hedging instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows 
at december   the company had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts
