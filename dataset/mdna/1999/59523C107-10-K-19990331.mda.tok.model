item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information all forward looking information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on management s current knowledge of factors affecting mamsi s business 
mamsi s actual results may differ materially if these assumptions prove invalid 
significant risk factors  while not all inclusive  are the possibility of increasing price competition in the company s market place 
the possibility of state budget related mandates that reduce premiums for medicaid recipients 
the potential for increased medical expenses due to increased utilization by the company s membership 
inflation in provider and pharmaceutical costs 
federal or state mandates that increase benefits or limit the company s oversight ability 
the possibility that the company is not able to expand its service territory as planned due to regulatory delays and or inability to contract with appropriate providers 
the possibility that the company is not able to increase its market share at the anticipated premium rates 
the possibility that one of the company s vendors will experience year problems that disrupt the company s operating or administrative systems 
general during the three year period ended december   the company experienced modest membership expansion 
while membership in certain products continues to grow  others have shown decreases when compared with the company has achieved its overall size by continually expanding its product lines which include point of service  small group  indemnity health  hybrid products  medicaid and medicare  group term life and through expansion into new geographic markets 
premium rates during this time have remained at or near competitive levels for the company s marketplace 
during  after consideration of non recurring adjustments  the company s consolidated operating margin showed increased profits over the company achieved s results  in part  by implementing product price increases and reducing membership in products or effectively terminating groups that had the potential for continued unprofitability 
the company anticipates that it will continue to increase premium rates during this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information above for a description of those risk factors 
the company generally receives a fixed premium amount per member per month while the majority of medical expenses are variable and significantly affected by spontaneous member utilization 
even with managed care controls  unusual medical conditions can occur  such as an outbreak of influenza or a higher than normal incidence of high cost cases such as premature births  complex surgeries  or rare diseases 
as a result  the company s quarterly results can be materially affected and irregular 
however  over the longer business cycle  the company believes that its managed care control systems  underwriting procedures when allowed and network of providers should result in continued profitability 
due to the continued escalation of health care costs and the inability of many individuals to obtain health care insurance  numerous proposals relating to health care reform have been made and put into effect  and additional proposals may be introduced  in the united states congress and the legislatures of the states in which the company operates or may seek to operate 
in  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  public law  commonly called hipaa  was enacted 
this bill establishes certain federal requirements for large group  small group  and individual health benefit plans  and applies not only to insurers and hmos but also to erisa plans 
hipaa is intended to make coverage more portable and available by limiting pre existing condition requirements  providing special enrollment periods for employees who lose other coverage or whose family status changes  prohibiting group plans from denying an individual coverage or charging a higher premium based on the individual s health status or history  and by guaranteeing coverage availability and renewability in certain circumstances in the small group and individual markets 
hipaa also allows for the establishment of medical savings accounts  increases the penalties for health care fraud and abuse  and calls for standardized health care information in order to reduce administrative costs 
the effect of hipaa differs from state to state 
in the group market  state laws remain in effect unless they prevent the application of the new federal requirements  and in the individual market  state laws govern if the health and human services secretary determines that they provide an acceptable alternative mechanism to the federal requirement 
this means that in those states  like maryland  where state reforms have already been enacted  the legislation has little  if any  effect in the small group market  but may have some effect in the individual market 
in other states  the legislation has a greater effect 
most of the provisions of hipaa took effect on july   but some  like the provisions pertaining to medical savings accounts  took effect earlier and others  like administrative simplification  took effect later 
in recent years  state legislatures in the hmos service area and the us congress have considered legislation  to amend civil tort law so as to extend enterprise liability to hmos  and or to amend regulatory requirements to establish additional rules governing hmo internal and external appeals and grievances 
neither the congress nor any state legislature in the hmos service area has enacted laws  which would expand an hmo s liability in tort action 
states in the hmos service area have enacted laws regarding internal and external appeals and grievances 
under these laws  persons covered by hmos are given a right to seek a fast and fair review of adverse utilization review decisions  first internally by a medical director of the hmo and then by an independent review organization or by a state regulator 
maryland  north carolina and pennsylvania have enacted laws  which became effective january  or earlier in  and which require hmos to have an appeals and grievance process meeting certain requirements and to submit adverse decisions to independent outside review in certain circumstances 
the district of columbia is expected to enact similar legislation  which would become effective on january the district of columbia  which has not previously regulated hmos  enacted legislation effective july   providing for regulatory oversight similar to that currently provided by other states 
the company believes that the current political environment in which it operates will result in continued legislative scrutiny of health care reform and may lead to additional legislative initiatives 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact on the company of any federal or state restructuring of the health care delivery or health care financing systems  but such changes could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of the company 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations consolidated net income of the company was  and  in and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share was 
in as compared to 
in this decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to a  non recurring item related to the results of an audit conducted in connection with the company s participation in the federal employee health benefit program 
the audit covered the periods with the audit findings related to years there were no findings for years the company has priced its health products competitively in order to increase its membership base and thereby enhance its strategic position in its market place 
the company currently has one of the largest hmo and managed care enrollments and also the largest network of contract providers of medical care in its service area which includes the entire states of maryland and delaware  the district of columbia  most counties and cities in virginia and certain areas of west virginia  north carolina and pennsylvania 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately million or percent over the year ended december  revenue for year ended december  includes million related to the sale of certain company owned real estate no longer required in its operations 
excluding these sales  year over year revenue increased percent 
a percent increase in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in an increase of approximately million in health premium revenue while a percent increase in average monthly premium per enrollee  combined for all products  resulted in a million increase in health premium revenue 
the increase in hmo and indemnity enrollment is principally due to increases in the company s commercial membership 
management believes that commercial health premiums should continue to increase over the next twelve months as the company continues to increase its commercial membership and as new and renewing groups are charged higher premium rates due to legislatively mandated benefit enhancements and general price increases initiated by the company 
this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information above for a description of the risk factors that may effect health premiums per member 
the company has implemented increased premium rates across essentially all of its commercial products 
as the company s contracts are generally for a one year period  increased pricing cannot be initiated until a contract reaches its renewal date 
therefore  price increases cannot be made across the company s membership at the same time 
commercial premium rate increases are expected to continue in in the range of to 
management believes that these rate increases may have the effect of slowing the company s future membership growth 
in addition  management reevaluated premium reimbursement rates with regard to its medicare and medicaid programs 
specifically  effective january   the company withdrew from participation in certain areas of the virginia medicaid program 
on january   the company also modified certain benefits for enrollees in its medicare program and began to charge additional premiums in certain areas 
in the third quarter of  three hmos with large medicare membership in the mid atlantic area announced that effective january  they would not continue their medicare risk contract with the health care financing administration hcfa 
in response to the company s perception of increased risk related to these hmos departure  the company requested a change to its already filed rates which were to be effective january  hcfa responded that they would not allow the company to change its filed rates 
based on hcfa s response  the company terminated its medicare contract effective january  at december  the company had approximately  medicare risk members 
the company s future membership growth depends on several factors such as relative premium prices and product availability  future increases or decreases in the company s service area  increased competition in the company s service area and changes in state mandated enrollment in medicaid hmo programs in which the company participates 
enrollment may also decrease if the company determines that premium reimbursement rates related to certain state medicaid programs are inadequate  which would cause the company to voluntarily withdraw from participation 
fee and other income increased from million in to million in  principally due to increased membership in the company s ppo product 
revenue from life and short term disability products contributed million in revenue in as compared with in the increase is mainly due to the products continued popularity with customers looking for one carrier to provide all of their employee benefit needs 
service revenue from non mamsi affiliated entities earned by the company s home health care subsidiaries decreased and contributed approximately million in revenue in as compared with million in this decrease is due to an increasing volume of business conducted for mamsi hmo and indemnity members which is eliminated in consolidation 
in the third quarter of  the national committee for quality assurance ncqa announced that oci and md ipa received three year  full accreditation 
full accreditation is granted to those plans that have excellent programs for continuous quality improvement and meet ncqa s rigorous standards 
medical expenses as a percentage of health premium revenue medical loss ratio decreased to percent for compared to percent for on a per member  per month basis  medical expenses increased percent 
included in the year ended december  are the results of the company s identification of certain claims which were overpaid 
these overpayments were caused  in large part  by a combination of factors including the ever increasing complexity of the claims paying process as well as providers enhancing their ability to maximize charges 
in connection with these overpayments  during the company recorded  as a reduction of medical expenses  approximately million relating to claims paid in the company believes that it has taken the appropriate action and implemented the appropriate controls to insure that future claims are paid at the appropriate amount 
these initiatives should help to control the company s medical loss ratio 
the statements in this paragraph and the preceding paragraphs regarding cost containment initiatives  total medical costs and future increases in health premiums are forward looking statements 
see forward looking information above for a description of risk factors that may affect medical expenses per member and the medical loss ratio 
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue administrative expense ratio decreased to percent for as compared to in adjusted to exclude the effect of the million gain on sale of real estate  the administrative expense ratio was percent for management believes that the administrative expense ratio will likely remain near the current level of percent in management s expectation concerning the administrative expense ratio is a forward looking statement 
the administrative expense ratio is affected by changes in health premiums and other revenues  development of the company s expansion areas and increased administrative activity related to business volume 
md ipa contracts with the office of personnel management opm to provide or arrange health services under the federal employee health benefit program fehbp 
the contract with opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating requirements for the fehbp 
the premiums established under the opm contract are subject to periodic review and audit to determine if they were established in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under the program 
in september   a pretax charge of approximately million was recognized in the company s financial statements in anticipation of negotiations relating to potential governmental claims for contracts with opm related to an audit conducted by the office of inspector general concerning the company s participation in fehbp for the years related to findings for in the normal course of business  opm audits health plans with which it contracts to verify  among other things  that the premiums calculated and charged to opm are established in compliance with the best price community rating guidelines established by opm 
opm typically audits plans once every five or six years  and each audit covers the prior five or six year period 
while the government s initial on site audits are usually followed by a post audit briefing as well as a preliminary audit report in which the government indicates its preliminary results  final resolution and settlement of the audits can take two to three years 
in addition to claims made by the opm auditors as part of the normal audit process  opm may also refer their results to the united states department of justice doj for potential legal action under the false claims act 
the doj has the authority to file a claim under the false claims act if it believes that the health plan knowingly overcharged the government or otherwise submitted false documentation or certifications 
in false claims act actions  the government may impose trebled damages and a civil penalty of not less than  nor more than  for each separate alleged false claim 
the company intends to negotiate with opm on all matters to attain a mutually satisfactory result 
there can be no assurance that these negotiations will be concluded satisfactorily  that the audit will not be referred to the doj  or that additional  possibly material  liability will be not be incurred 
the company believes that any ultimate liability in excess of amounts accrued would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position 
however  such liability could have a material effect on results of operations or cash flows of a future period if resolved unfavorably 
also reflected in the company s results is a million write down of certain computer and computer related assets that the company had identified as being no longer of use and which were discarded or sold 
investment income decreased million due to a decrease in realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities of million offset by an increase in interest income due to higher investable balances 
income tax expense as a percent of pretax income decreased from percent in to percent in  in large part due to the relative increase of tax exempt interest income as a percent of pretax income 
the net margin rate decreased from percent in to 
percent in this decrease is primarily due to the non recurring item related to the company s participation in the fehbp 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations consolidated net income loss of the company was  and  in and  respectively 
diluted net earnings loss per share was 
in as compared to 
in the increase in earnings is primarily attributable to a decrease in the medical loss ratio for commercial products 
the medical loss ratio decreased primarily due to increased efforts by the company to control medical costs 
revenue for the year ended december  decreased approximately million or percent over the year ended december  a percent decrease in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in a decrease of approximately million in health premium revenue while a percent increase in the average monthly premium per enrollee combined for all products resulted in a million increase in health premium revenue 
service revenue from non mamsi affiliated entities earned by the company s home health care subsidiaries contributed million in revenue in as compared to million for this increase is the result of increasing business volume for these subsidiaries  particularly in the home infusion area  which is largely offset by an increasing relative percentage of business conducted for mamsi hmo and indemnity members which is eliminated in consolidation 
revenue from life and short term disability products contributed million in as compared to million in medical expenses as a percentage of health premium revenue medical loss ratio decreased to percent in as compared to percent for and  on a per member per month basis  medical expenses decreased percent 
this decrease is due to a combination of factors including continuing efforts by the company to implement product specific cost containment controls  expanded activity in specialized subrogation areas and claims review for dual health coverage  the adoption of regionalized and product specific fee maximums for specialists from the delivery network following a continuing intensified peer review analysis 
in addition  during  the company identified certain claims which had been overpaid and recorded as a reduction of medical expenses approximately million relating to claims incurred and paid in the administrative expense ratio for increased to percent from percent in this increase is due primarily to increased salaries and expenses in certain administrative areas of the company  including utilization management claims audit and customer service departments  as well as reduced revenue in the net margin rate increased from 
percent in to percent in this increase is primarily due to the decrease in the medical loss ratio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business is not capital intensive and the majority of the company s expenses are payments to health care providers  which generally vary in direct proportion to the health premium revenues received by the company 
although medical utilization rates vary by season  the payments for such expenses lag behind cash inflow from premiums because of the lag in provider billing procedures 
in the past  the company s cash requirements have been met principally from operating cash flow and it is anticipated that this source  coupled with the company s operating line of credit  will be sufficient in the future 
accounts receivable decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in amounts due from the federal government and a reduction in receivables from customers offset somewhat by increased medical recoverables 
prepaid expenses  advances and other current assets increased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to an increase in income taxes receivable and an increase in hospital working capital advances 
property and equipment decreased from million at december  to million at december  due to the sale of two office buildings no longer required in the company s operations and the disposal of certain computer equipment no longer needed 
short term investments are marked to market at the end of every quarter and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected in the ending stockholders equity balance 
accordingly  stockholders equity at december  reflects an unrealized gain of million  net of tax  on the company s short term investments 
medical claims payable increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to increased membership and increased medical expense per member 
additional paid in capital decreased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to activity in the company s stock compensation trust 
this trust is used to provide shares of the company s stock to meet its stock option plan obligations 
treasury stock increased from million at december  to million at december  due to the purchase of approximately million additional shares by the company 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences that  in management s opinion  are more likely than not to be realized in the current or future periods 
the company s history of operating revenue and income growth  and expectation of future operating income  provides strong positive evidence that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for net operating loss carryforwards generated by certain subsidiaries that are not deductible on the company s consolidated tax return 
management intends to continue to monitor the realizability of deferred tax assets in light of future circumstances and assess the reasonableness of the valuation allowance 
the company currently has access to total revolving credit facilities of million  which is used to provide short term capital resources for routine cash flow fluctuations 
at december   approximately million was drawn against these facilities 
in addition  the company maintains a million letter of credit for the benefit of the north carolina insurance department in support of operations of mamsi life and health company and a  letter of credit for the company s home health subsidiary 
while no amounts have been drawn against these letters of credit  they are a reduction of the company s credit line availability 
following is a schedule of the short term capital resources available to the company december in thousands cash and cash equivalents   short term investments   working capital advances to maryland hospitals   total available liquid assets   credit line availability   total short term capital resources   the company believes that cash generated from operations along with its current liquidity and borrowing capabilities are adequate for both current and planned expanded operations 
the company sold an office building in april  at a price of approximately million 
in july   the company sold another of its office buildings for approximately million 
the company s purchase of an approximately  square foot office building in frederick  maryland in  and the resulting consolidation of its service departments in this new facility  made the previously owned buildings unnecessary for the company s operations 
in  the company began the process of identifying  evaluating and implementing changes to computer programs necessary to address the year issue yk 
this issue affects computer systems that have time sensitive programs that may not properly recognize the year this could result in major system failures or miscalculations 
the company is currently addressing its internal year issue with modifications to existing programs 
as a part of the company s initial assessment   software programs were identified for yk review 
of those  programs were identified as needing modification of which were modified and were determined to be obsolete 
to date  the company has modified the majority of the programs with internal resources diverted from other projects  none of which are critical to the company s daily operations 
testing and validation of the modified programs is complete 
the company has incurred less than  to date and does not anticipate significant additional costs to bring the yk compliance program to completion 
approximately two thirds of the company s critical vendors have indicated yk compliance and the company anticipates completion of this evaluation in the second quarter of the company is actively pursuing the remainder for confirmation of yk compliance 
based upon the work completed to date  the company does not anticipate any future material impact on its financial statements 
with regard to the company s most reasonably likely worst case scenario  the company believes that such scenario involves the possibility that a small number of reports will display incorrect data  a small number of programs may give unusual data and a small number of vendors will not be yk compliant 
in terms of a contingency plan  the company believes it has sufficient internal resources to be able to correct such report errors and address non compliant vendors within a relatively short time frame 
if internal resources prove to be insufficient  the company will engage outside resources 
the statements in this paragraph regarding future effects of the year issue is a forward looking statement
