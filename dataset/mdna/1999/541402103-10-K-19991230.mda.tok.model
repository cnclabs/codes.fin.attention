overview historically  the company has been one of the smallest publicly traded semiconductor manufacturers 
following its formation  the company initially developed plug compatible second source products that were form  fit  and function compatible with products offered by other manufacturers 
beginning in  the company began identifying unique  proprietary products driven by its existing customer base 
while this transition to proprietary products required the company to access advanced design automation tools and to sharply increase the number of people involved in product development  it enables the company to limit its distribution channels and the costs of those channels  and to compete in markets with pricing and delivery demands that are not as highly competitive as the markets for second source products 
the company focus on proprietary products continues 
the company introduced a number of such products in  following its transition to that focus 
in fiscal  the company developed newer products that were designed in incorporated into end system level products in the hdtv market 
in fiscal  the company increased its efforts to develop chips for use in wireless digital communications 
the company presently derives its revenues primarily from the sale of semiconductor chips that perform high speed dsp in video image filtering and digital communications applications 
the company s continued and increased focus on proprietary products had a dramatic impact on the company s financial results in fiscal  when the company recorded significant write downs of inventory and long lived assets and incurred severance costs as it recognized the obsolescence of its more mature  second source products 
in fiscal  the company recognized fewer revenues from the hdtv market than it anticipated because the ramp up in high definition broadcasting was slower than independent market research had suggested would occur 
in addition  sales of the company s existing products were adversely impacted as broadcasters delayed planned incremental upgrades of facilities that would have become obsolete as a result of the transition to television broadcasting from analog to digital 
the company believes that the transition to digital broadcasting will expand opportunities in the future for its newer products that facilitate the processing of studio quality broadcast images 
notwithstanding the impact of the transition in the broadcasting industry  the company enjoyed improvements in balance sheet liquidity  reduced indebtedness  and greatly improved cash flow 
this improved financial performance resulted from the company s fiscal restructuring and from its aggressive expense controls and capital expenditure limitations in the company s financial reporting is affected by fiscal year changes made in fiscal and in  the company elected to change its fiscal year from a date certain september year end to a fiscal year comprised of weeks  each comprised of seven days  beginning monday and ending on sunday 
this change resulted in the company s fiscal year ending on october  rather than on september the company s fiscal year is therefore comprised of days  instead of in  the company changed its fiscal year end to september from december as a result  the company reported financial results for a nine month period in  rather than a month period 
unless otherwise noted  all references to  fiscal period or fiscal mean such nine month period 
results of operations fiscal year ended october  compared to the nine month fiscal period ended september  net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  were  up percent from the  recorded in the nine month fiscal period ended september  the increase is due to the three additional months in the full month fiscal year in cost of revenues decreased from  in the nine month period ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended october  the gross margin increased from a loss of  for the nine month period in to  in  due to the decrease in cost of goods sold in fiscal and a restructuring charge in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal this increase in gross profit dollars and in gross profit margin on revenue from product sales in fiscal was due to improved margins and lower costs resulting from the restructuring actions the company took at the end of fiscal  and from the effect of inventory write downs adversely impacting margins and costs in fiscal research and development expenses were  in the fiscal year ended october  compared to  in the nine month fiscal period ended september  research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of increased engineering staffing and the three month longer duration of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent from  in the nine month fiscal period ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended october  as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  due to the company s increased efforts to control costs 
for the fiscal year ended october   operating income increased to  from a loss of  for the nine month fiscal period ended september   due to the above mentioned factors 
as a percentage of net revenues  operating income increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal interest expense increased from  in fiscal to  for fiscal  as a result of higher interest rates  created when the company s lender increased its prime rates from which the company s interest rates are derived  bank fees associated with the company s credit facility that has been replaced and with the establishment of the company s new credit facility  and an additional three months contained in the full month fiscal year in as a result of the foregoing  net earnings increased from a loss of  for the nine month fiscal period ended september  to  for the fiscal year ended october  nine month fiscal period ended september  compared to the nine month period ended september  net revenues for the nine month fiscal period ended september  were  up six percent from the  recorded in the nine month period ended september  cost of revenues increased from  in the nine month period ended september  to  in the nine month fiscal period ended september  gross profit decreased from  for the nine month period in to  in fiscal  due to this increase in cost of goods sold and due to the recording of certain one time charges associated with the company s business plan reorganization 
gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased from for the nine month period in to negative percent in fiscal this decrease in gross profit dollars and decrease in gross profit margin on revenue from product sales was due to the increase in cost of goods sold as well as higher inventory write downs in the period 
research and development expenses were  in the nine month fiscal period ended september  versus  in the nine month period ended september  research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from for the nine month period in to in fiscal research and development expenses decreased in fiscal compared to the period as a result of fewer mature product re tooling charges for the period 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in the nine month period ended september  to  in the nine month fiscal period ended september  as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from for the nine month period in to in fiscal for the nine month fiscal period ended september   the operating loss increased to  from  for the nine month period ended september   due to the above mentioned factors 
as a percentage of net revenues  operating income decreased from negative for the nine month period in to negative in fiscal interest expense increased from  for the nine month period in to  in fiscal  as the company s borrowing increased from  at september  to  at september  as a result of the foregoing  the net loss increased from a loss of  for the nine month period ended september  to a loss of  for the nine month fiscal period ended september  liquidity and capital resources for the three fiscal periods ended october   september   and december   the company s cash flow after tax net income loss plus non cash items has significantly exceeded its net earnings  due to significant non cash charges for restructuring  depreciation  and inventory write downs 
this cash flow  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal and bank borrowings  as well as a private sale of common stock for an aggregate consideration of  in september   have served as the primary source of financing for the company s working capital needs and for capital expenditures during these fiscal periods 
during fiscal  the company s after tax net cash flow net earnings of  plus non cash items of  along with a decrease in inventories of  was offset by growth in accounts receivable of  these items  along with other net cash flow items from operations  produced a total of  in net cash from operating activities 
capital expenditures and increases to other assets used  in cash 
bank borrowing and loans from two principal shareholders provided  in cash  and repayment of long term capital lease obligations and bank borrowings used  in cash 
the company collected a  note receivable in may net of such amounts resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of  for the period 
during fiscal  the company s after tax net cash flow net loss of  plus non cash items of  along with increases in inventories of  decreases in accounts receivables of  and other net cash flow items from operations  used a total of  for operating activities 
capital expenditures and increases to other assets used  in cash 
bank borrowing provided  in cash  and repayment of long term capital lease obligations and bank borrowings used  in cash 
the company also raised  in additional equity in september net of such amounts resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of  for the period 
during  the company s after tax cash earnings net loss of  plus non cash items of  along with a decrease in inventories of  were offset by growth in accounts receivable of  these items  along with other net cash flow items from operations  provided a total of  in net cash from operating activities 
capital equipment expenditures and increases to other assets used  in cash 
bank borrowing provided  in cash  and repayment of long term capital lease obligations and bank borrowings used  in cash 
net of such amounts resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  for the period 
the company has addressed its requirements for working capital by reducing expenditures  accelerating accounts receivable collections  and by shifting its focus to higher margin products 
the company believes that these actions combined with anticipated after tax cash earnings  and reductions in the levels of inventories as well as the financing available under its existing bank lines of credit  will be sufficient to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
working capital the company s investment in inventories and accounts receivable has been significant and will continue to be significant in the future 
over prior periods  the company  as a nature of its business  has maintained high levels of inventories and accounts receivable in order to be responsive to its customer base 
as it continues to shift from more competitive second source products to proprietary sole source products  the company believes it will be able to streamline its inventories 
it also intends to shorten its accounts receivable collection cycle by re focusing on direct sales to customers rather than through distribution channels 
the company relies on third party suppliers for its raw materials  particularly its processed wafers  for which there is currently one supplier  and as a result  maintains substantial inventory levels to protect against disruption in supplies 
in the past  the company has experienced disruptions in obtaining wafers from its suppliers 
as the company continues to shift towards higher margin proprietary products  it expects to be able to reduce inventory levels by streamlining its product offerings 
the company s accounts receivable level is generally correlated to the company s previous quarter revenue level 
because of customer order scheduling  up to of the quarterly revenues are often shipped in the last month of the quarter 
therefore  a large portion of the quarterly shipments reflected in quarter end accounts receivable are not yet due per the company s net day terms 
this  combined with the fact that the company s distributors which made up of the company s revenues often pay beyond the company s terms  often results in quarter end accounts receivable balances being at their highest point for the period 
the company expects to be able to reduce accounts receivable levels through its shift in sales focus toward direct customer sales rather than the past broad channel management sales activities it has required to support its second source products 
although current levels of inventory impact the company s liquidity  the company believes that these items are a cost of doing business as a fab less operation 
the company continues to evaluate alternative suppliers to diversify its risk of supply disruption 
however  this requires a significant investment in product development to tool with new suppliers 
such efforts compete for the company s limited product development resources 
the company seeks to achieve on going reductions in inventory 
however  it cannot guarantee that such reductions will be achieved within a precise period of time due to both its current high rate of introductions of new products into the inventory pool and its inability to control customer order schedules 
financing on july   the company replaced its previous revolving line of credit with two new lines of credit from silicon valley bank  with an aggregate availability of up to  a domestic line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate at october  plus  which is basis points less than the rate borne under the company s previous facility 
the line of credit requires the company to maintain a minimum quick ratio of not less than to for the final quarter of fiscal and a ratio of to for the quarter ended december  and thereafter  and profitability on a quarterly basis 
borrowings under the domestic line are subject to the limits of eligible domestic accounts receivable  and is secured by all of the assets of the company 
the second line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus  and is secured by certain of the company s inventory  accounts receivable  and related proceeds  and is guaranteed in part by a federal agency 
this facility has other terms similar to the company s first line of credit facility 
both credit facilities mature july  on october   the company had an aggregate of  outstanding under these facilities 
under the terms of its line of credit facilities  the company is precluded from paying any dividends without the consent of the parties to such agreements  even if the company is in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
regardless of any such restrictions in its bank loan agreements  the company does not intend to pay cash dividends in the near future and anticipates reinvesting its cash flow in operations 
on february   the non employee directors of the company were granted warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the grants were ratified by shareholders of the company at the company s annual meeting of shareholders held june  the warrants currently have an exercise price of per share and expire on february  of these warrants   were exercised in  at the original exercise price of  by two of the non employee directors through loans made to them from the company 
the loans matured july and accrued interest at the reference rate plus 
the non employee director loans were extended for a one year period ending july as part of the loan extension agreement  the terms of the loans were changed to increase the interest rate by and to require the lenders to sell their shares consistent with existing market conditions and repay their loans at any time when the offer price for the underlying shares reached 
these loans were repaid in june on september   the company sold  newly issued shares of common stock for per share or  in the aggregate in equal amounts to william j 
volz  president and a director of the company  and brt partnership 
brt partnership is a partnership  whose sole partners are individual trusts  commonly known as the bea ritch trusts  the beneficiaries of which are family members of burton w 
kanter  a director of the company  though mr 
kanter is not a beneficiary 
the per share sale price equals the closing price for the company s common stock on september   the date on which the parties entered into an agreement to effect such sale 
the company agreed to register these shares upon request of the purchasers 
as discussed in the company s form q for the quarter ended march   the company borrowed  in addition to its bank borrowings  an aggregate principal amount of  on february  the loans are unsecured and bear interest to maturity at the rate which is the reference rate or equivalent rate of interest quoted  published  or announced by sanwa bank  plus 
the loans had an original maturity of march   but the holders of the loans successively extended the maturity dates through november  and december  the loan extended through november   for  was paid on that date 
the loan extended through december   for  was paid on december  while the company will continue to evaluate debt and equity financing opportunities  it believes its financing arrangements and cash flow generated from operations provide an adequate base of liquidity to fund operations and meet the capital needs to support the company s operations 
year compliance the year creates the potential for date related data to cause computer processing errors or system shut downs because computer controlled systems have historically used two rather than four digits to define years 
for example  computer programs that contain time data sensitive software may recognize a date using two digits of as the year rather than the year the miscalculations and systems failures that may be caused by such date misrecognition could disrupt the operations of the company 
since the risk relates to computer controlled systems  the year issue affects computer software  computer hardware  and any other equipment with embedded technology that involves date sensitive functions 
the company has determined to assess the scope of its year problems  to remediate the problem  and to plan for the contingency of remediation failure separately for each of its internal computer software programs  its computer hardware  its machinery that includes embedded computer technology  its suppliers  and its products 
as a result of its assessment  the company has determined that none of its products have date sensitive functions and  accordingly  that no products will require modification or replacement 
the company believes that it has identified all of its computer software programs  computer hardware  and machinery with imbedded computer technology 
this assessment was eased by the small amount of computers and other machinery that the company possesses relative to the size of its operations  since production and assembly of its products is outsourced 
the company also believes it has determined the extent to which its customers and suppliers may be impacted by year computer processing problems 
this assessment was slower than the company s other year assessment efforts since it necessarily involves obtaining information from third parties  and the company s suppliers are foreign operations which may have local customs or attitudes regarding disclosure that differ from those in the united states 
because the company relies on third parties to manufacture its chips and assemble its products  the company s production may be slowed or other of its operations may be adversely impacted by the year problems of its suppliers 
however  the company has received written assurances from all of its critical suppliers  including the silicon foundry supplying the company with silicon wafers  that they are year compliant 
the company does not believe it has any technological interfaces with customers that will be affected by the year issue 
the company completed remediation of its computer hardware  internal computer software programs  and equipment with imbedded technology in march through december   the company has spent approximately  modifying or replacing its internal computer software programs  its computer hardware  and machinery with embedded computer technology  primarily to upgrade software and to modify maintenance agreements 
since it believes remediation of such systems has been completed  the company does not expect to expend any material amounts on such remediation in the future 
however  if the company has failed to properly assess any of the year problems or failed to fully remedy any identified year problems of its computer hardware  computer software programs  or machinery with embedded technology  the company may be forced to spend more than anticipated on such remediation in the future 
until we are comfortably past the year new year  the company will not be able to reasonably estimate any further costs of eliminating problems caused by the year problems of its suppliers  whether by investing in new technology or software to interface with these parties or by finding alternative sources of supply 
on june   the company began to shift production away from suppliers that had not demonstrated year compliance to the company s satisfaction  to the company s current suppliers that are year compliant 
if such current suppliers are unable to satisfy increased production burdens  the company expects to engage new suppliers that are year compliant 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to shift additional production to any of its current suppliers or to new suppliers without additional costs or at all 
shifts to new suppliers typically require capital outlays and increased time requirements for production  either of which may adversely affect the results of operations of the company 
inasmuch as the company has already begun its year fiscal year  many of its internal systems have already begun to operate on year dates 
to date  there has been no incidence of year errors or shutdowns 
the company has backlog from its customers  and purchase commitments with its suppliers that extend well into year the systems that track and control these activities have handled year dates without incident 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company conducts all of its transactions  including those with foreign suppliers and customers  in us dollars 
it is therefore not directly subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations and does not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments in an attempt to minimize such risks 
of course  demand from foreign customers and the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations to the company may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or supplier s domestic currency to the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  changes in the relative value of the us dollar may change the price of the company s prices relative to the prices of its foreign competitors 
the company also does not hold any market risk sensitive instruments that are not considered cash under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s credit facilities bear interest at rates determined from the prime rate of the company s lender  therefore  changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest that the company is required to pay thereunder
