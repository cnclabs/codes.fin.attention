item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide greater details of the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information under item selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data included elsewhere herein 
certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements under the reform act which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to i the timely completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s new edram and fram products  ii broader customer acceptance of its edram and esdram products and low density fram products  iii acceptance of new high density fram products  which may be developed  iv the company s ability to manufacture its products on a cost effective and timely basis at its alliance foundry operations  v the company s ability to perform under existing alliance agreements and to develop new alliance and foundry relationships  vi the alliance partners willingness to continue development activities as they relate to their license agreements with the company  vii the effects on the company from the common stock price adjustment with respect to the holders of common stock issued in the december private placement  viii the effect on the company from its obligations pursuant to its outstanding series a convertible preferred stock  ix the willingness of a principal shareholder to extend the due date of an outstanding loan to the company  x statements regarding future potential changes in the company s capital structure  xi the availability and related cost of future financing  xii the retention of key personnel  xiii the outcome of the company s patent interference  patent infringement and litigation proceedings  and xiv factors not directly related to the company  such as competitive pressures on pricing  marketing conditions in general  competition  technological progression  product obsolescence and the changing needs of potential customers and the semiconductor industry in general 
for additional information concerning these and other factors  see expected future results of operations in this item since its inception  the company has been primarily engaged in the research and development of ferroelectric technology and the design  development and commercialization of fram products and edram products 
revenue has been derived from the sale of the company s fram and edram products beginning primarily in the company has also generated revenue under license and development agreements entered into with a limited number of established semiconductor manufacturers and involving the development of specific applications of the company s technologies 
accordingly  fluctuations in the company s revenues have resulted primarily from the timing of significant product orders  the timing of the signing of license development agreements  and the achievement of related performance milestones 
for  and  fram product sales represented approximately  and of total product sales revenue  respectively  while edram product sales accounted for  and  respectively  for the same periods 
during these periods  product sales revenue accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenues  the remainder of which were generated principally from license and development fees and customer sponsored research and development revenue 
as a result of the company s limited revenues as compared to its substantial ongoing product research and development costs and high manufacturing costs for certain of its products  the company has incurred losses on a consolidated basis in each fiscal year since its inception and has required substantial capital infusions in the form of debt and equity financing 
the company has entered into development and or licensing arrangements with several major semiconductor manufacturers  namely hitachi  rohm  toshiba  fujitsu  ibm and siemens to advance the development of both its fram products and edram products and to provide the company with access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and capacity for such products 
in december  the company also entered into a license agreement with samsung  although such arrangement does not include any development activities between the company and samsung or the availability of manufacturing capacity to the company from samsung 
in addition to these licensing and or development arrangements  in december  the company entered into a fram development agreement with asahi which does not currently include a license to the company s fram technology 
results of operations revenues 
in  product sales revenues increased by approximately over product sales revenues in to a total of million  consisting of sales of million of fram products and million of edram products 
this is compared to total product sales revenues during of million from the sale of million of fram products and million of edram products 
the increase in product sales revenue in as compared with resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of edram products shipped to new and existing customers  primarily in the communications sector 
in addition  increases in fram product sales resulted from the first availability of the company s fram products from one of the company s alliance foundry manufacturing sources and from renewed sales and marketing activities resulting from the increased availability of fram products 
the company was able to maintain average selling prices on its products during despite significant price declines in competing products during the year 
product sales for consisted of kilobit  kilobit and rfid fram products and megabit edram products 
in  product sales revenues decreased by approximately over product sales revenues in to a total of million  consisting of sales of million of fram products and million of edram products  compared to total product sales revenues during of million from the sale of million of fram products and million of edram products 
the decrease in product sales revenue in as compared with resulted primarily from a decrease in the average selling prices of the company s edram products 
even though a decrease in edram revenue was recorded in  the actual number of edram units shipped during increased slightly over shipment levels 
the decrease in fram product revenues during resulted from a decrease in product availability from the company s manufacturing facility in colorado springs 
this decrease in product availability was driven primarily by the company s desire to maintain quarterly fram product revenues in the  to  range until low cost volume fram production became available through the company s fram alliance partners 
in  the company did not recognize any license and development fee revenue 
in and  the company recognized license and development fee revenues of million and million  respectively 
the company believes that its lack of license fee revenues during were driven primarily by the asian financial crisis and the overall semiconductor industry downturn experienced during the year 
further  the company and its alliance partners did not reach any contractual milestones during the year to allow for the recognition of any milestone licensing revenue pursuant to the terms of existing licensing agreements 
the company s license fee revenues during resulted from the achievement of milestones pursuant to an existing license arrangement with fujitsu and from the company entering into a new fram development agreement with asahi 
the company s license and development fee revenues during resulted from the achievement of milestones pursuant to existing license arrangements  the granting of a new license for the use of the company s ferroelectric technology and the granting of fram product designs to an existing licensee 
revenues from licensing activities during were recognized from hitachi  rohm  toshiba  fujitsu and samsung 
the company enters into customer sponsored research and development activities primarily as a means to further the development of its technology with certain strategic partners  customers or potential future technology licensees 
revenues from such activities were   and  in  and  respectively 
costs related to such activities were   and  in  and  respectively 
cost of sales 
in  and  cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues were  and  respectively 
in  a loss on manufacturing contract totaling million was recorded see loss on manufacturing contract 
the loss on manufacturing contract as a percentage of product revenues in was 
the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues in compared with resulted primarily from lower costs of manufacturing for the company s edram products and relatively stable average selling prices of the edram products 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain its current average selling prices during and subsequent periods 
during  the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for edram products is expected to increase as the company introduces new products with initially higher manufacturing costs 
the higher manufacturing costs are the result of low initial manufacturing volumes 
as the volume of sales and production increase throughout on these products  the company expects to be able to achieve increasingly lower manufacturing costs and commensurate improved product gross margins 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s fram products remained high for the year resulting primarily from the absorption of manufacturing overhead on a limited amount of product produced in the company s colorado springs facility  and beginning during  in an alliance foundry facility in japan 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for fram products is expected to decrease during as a greater quantity and mix of fram products sold by the company will be manufactured at the company s lower cost alliance foundry manufacturing facilities 
the improvement in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues in over the same period in related directly to the company s edram products 
lower supply costs for the company s edram products were the primary reason leading to the improved cost of product sales percentage for the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s edram products were approximately in  in  and in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s fram products were approximately in and for each of and the overall cost of product sales  especially for fram products  has remained high due primarily to the company s introduction of new product designs  low volume of manufacturing and changes in manufacturing processes 
furthermore  the low manufacturing volume of fram products has resulted in higher costs associated with the company s external packaging and testing services and the cmos underlayer supply used in internal fram manufacturing 
improvements in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for fram products are expected during resulting primarily from the company receiving product from the advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and facilities of the company s foundry alliances  assuming further successful completion of development and product qualification 
loss on manufacturing contract 
in august  the company entered into a contract to manufacture  in the company s colorado springs manufacturing facility  a limited number of rfid memory chips using the company s fram memory technology 
the company estimates that the manufacturing of this product will be completed by the end of march as of december   the company determined that the total contract revenue compared with the estimated contract costs of manufacturing this product indicated that a loss in fulfilling the contract would be incurred 
the loss resulted from low product manufacturing yields  raw material quality issues and complications in product testing due to the complexity of the chip design 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge to earnings reflecting the total estimated loss to be incurred in the fulfillment of the contract in the amount of  research and development 
in  research and development expenses remained relatively flat with and totaled million compared with million in the company incurred substantial increases in research and development expenses during for product development of its megabit esdram products and for additional future edram products 
edram product engineering expenses associated with the megabit esdram development increased significantly during to million from 
million in such increases in product engineering expenses included megabit esdram development costs for photomasks  engineering wafers and test probe cards totaling approximately million 
further  edram engineering design expenses increased by or roughly 
million to million during as compared to 
million during to support the megabit esdram development and future edram product development 
these increases in expenses for new edram product development were offset by decreases in fram research and development activities that utilized the company s colorado springs fabrication facility 
during the last five months of  the company s colorado springs fabrication facility was used almost entirely for the fulfillment of an rfid manufacturing contract entered into in august  rather than for fram technology development purposes 
certain of the resources that would typically be used in fram research and development activities were  therefore  used in fulfilling the rfid manufacturing contract and are included in cost of sales amounts and a recorded million loss on manufacturing contract recorded in the company anticipates that overall research and development costs will increase during and in future years as new fram and edram products and technologies are developed and as expected future increases in product revenues are achieved 
in  research and development expenses decreased by million as compared with the same period in  due primarily to the absence of the expense associated with a non cash  non recurring employee incentive program approved by the company s stockholders in december and terminated in december such research and development incentive expense totaled approximately million in when comparing to  absent the employee incentive expense of million  research and development expenses would have decreased by approximately 
million or 
the decrease in research and development costs in is primarily related to a decrease in design and development costs for new products and processes associated with the company s colorado springs manufacturing facility 
such decreases were the result of the company s focus on product development activities through its fram alliance partners and utilizing their manufacturing facilities 
these decreases were partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance costs required to maintain the company s aging fabrication equipment in its colorado springs facility 
sales  general and administrative 
in  sales  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  to million from million in the primary increases in sg a expenses during when compared to  were for commissions on increased product revenues and for financial advisory and legal costs incurred associated with legal and restructuring issues surrounding the company s convertible preferred stock 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in foreign withholding taxes during  as there were no licensing fee revenues recorded during the company recorded  in foreign withholding taxes from licensing activities during the company believes that sg a expenses for will increase as a result of commissions on increased product sales and from additional financial advisory and legal costs associated with the company s convertible preferred stock 
in  sales  general and administrative expenses decreased by million compared to due primarily to the absence of the expense associated with a non cash  non recurring employee incentive program approved by the company s stockholders in december and terminated in december such incentive expense totaled approximately million in when comparing to  absent the employee incentive expense of million  sales  general and administrative expenses would have decreased by approximately 
million or  primarily resulting from a decrease in withholding taxes associated with the company s license and development arrangements 
common stock price adjustment 
in december  the company issued and sold in a private placement to certain investment funds holders  shares of common stock at an issue price of per share 
the purchase agreement for such common stock provided that  if during the twelve month period following the closing of the transaction  the company sold any shares of common stock for an issue price lower than the purchase price  the purchase price per share of the common stock would be adjusted downward to equal the lower issue price 
any adjustment would be effected by issuing additional shares of common stock to the holders 
an issuance of common stock for an issue price lower than the purchase price occurred during september and october as a result of preferred stock conversions 
the lowest issue price from these conversions was 
per share  which then triggered a price adjustment pursuant to the terms of the common stock purchase agreement 
the holders are not required to accept  by way of this adjustment  a number of common shares such that the total number of common shares held by the holders would exceed of the total outstanding common stock of the company 
the company would be required to effect the adjustment by cash refund 
as of december   the additional shares and cash refund to effect the limitation adjustment is  shares and  respectively 
accordingly  the company s obligation to deliver cash to the holders was recorded as a charge to earnings during interest expense 
in  related party interest expense increased by approximately or  over resulting from the expensing of interest on million of additional borrowings  which occurred during the last four months of under the company s credit facility with the national electrical benefit fund 
there were no borrowings under the credit facility during in  interest expense  related party increased by approximately over resulting from interest accrued on the additional borrowings totaling million from the national electrical benefit fund credit facility 
other income expense 
in  the company recorded interest income of approximately 
million 
in  the company recognized income associated with the collection of a 
million receivable written off in the previous year 
the recognition of this income was the primary reason for the 
million increase in other income expense in compared to imputed dividends accretion of discount on convertible preferred stock 
during the year ended december   the company recorded preferred stock non cash imputed dividends and accretion of discount totaling 
million and million  respectively 
the imputed dividend and accretion of discount results from certain provisions of the company s preferred stock  whereby a dividend is to be paid to the holders of the preferred stock in additional shares of preferred stock  and the conversion price of the preferred stock is determined by applying a discount  which increases over a fourteen month period from to a maximum of by may the discount computed at issuance of  is recorded as a reduction of preferred stock and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the discount is being recognized ratably as a non cash deemed dividend over the applicable fourteen month period 
expected future results of operations the company is continuing its efforts to improve and increase commercial production and sales of its edram products and low density fram products  decrease the cost of producing such products and develop and commercialize new high and low density fram products and enhancements to its existing fram and edram products 
the company expects revenues will continue to be sporadic in the foreseeable future until the company s products gain wider market acceptance  new license arrangements are entered into and milestones under the company s existing and any new license and development agreements are achieved 
the company s ability to significantly increase product sales and achieve profitability will depend on several factors  including i the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s high density fram products  ii the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s new edram products  iii wider customer acceptance of its edram products and low density fram products  iv market acceptance of new high and low density fram products which may be developed  v the company s ability to manufacture its products on a cost effective and timely basis through alliance foundry operations and third party foundry sources  vi the availability and related cost of future financing  and vii factors not directly related to the company  including market conditions  competition  technological progression  product obsolescence and the changing needs of potential customers and the semiconductor industry in general 
to gain access to advanced cmos manufacturing processes and facilities  ramtron has entered into manufacturing alliances and licensing agreements for fram products with companies having or constructing advanced memory products manufacturing capability  including rohm  hitachi  toshiba and fujitsu 
since the purchase or construction of an advanced manufacturing facility capable of mass producing memory devices would require a capital outlay well beyond the company s current capital resources  the company believes that the most suitable alternative is this strategic alliance approach  which the company believes will enable it to develop  manufacture and sell fram products more rapidly and cost effectively than any other available alternative 
ramtron s intention is to utilize current and future alliance relationships as foundry sources for fram products in order to provide the company with low cost  high volume  high quality fram products for resale to customers 
the company intends to produce edram s through strategic alliances and foundry arrangements with major semiconductor companies and to expand the market for edram s by making edram products available from multiple sources 
this approach avoids the high capital costs associated with dram manufacturing that would have otherwise been incurred by the company if it had chosen to manufacture these products with company provided resources 
as a result of industry wide oversupply of semiconductor memory products  significant price decreases within the industry have occurred during the past several years 
historically  the semiconductor memory industry has experienced declining average selling prices  and the company believes these declines will continue to effect the company 
accordingly  the company s ability to increase revenues and margins on its products depends on the company s ability to increase unit sales volumes and to introduce new products with higher margins or further reduce its manufacturing costs to offset the declines in average selling prices 
absent these actions  declining average selling prices would have an adverse effect on the company s gross product margins and the overall financial performance of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce new  higher margin products or reduce its manufacturing costs in the future 
year the company utilizes software and related technologies throughout its business and relies on suppliers of services and materials that will be affected by the date change in the year or prior 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to recognize the year may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company has initiated a year project to address the year issues as they relate to the company 
the company s year project is being managed by a team of internal staff 
the team s activities are designed to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the company s operations and that transactions with customers  vendors and financial institutions are fully supported 
the company has initiated formal communications with vendors  customers and financial institutions to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues as such issues interface with the company s systems or otherwise effect the company 
the company has completed the assessment and testing phases of its year project and is currently in the remediation phase of the project 
such remediation is scheduled to be completed during may the company anticipates that its remediation activities together with a contingency plan will be completed prior to mid year the company believes  based on progress to date  that the costs of complying with the year issues will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
the company believes that the estimated total cost of compliance for year will be less than  the company has determined that certain of its software and hardware will have to be replaced or updated so that its systems will operate properly with respect to dates in the periods prior to the year and beyond 
the company does not currently use any third party custom written software in its operations and  therefore  does not believe that a significant exposure exists in becoming year compliant as the majority of its software is issued with frequent updates  which have or are expected to address the year compliance issue 
the company believes that with updates to new software or replacement or modification to certain non compliant hardware  the year issue will not pose a significant operational problem for the company s systems 
however  if such updates  replacements or modifications are not made in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company believes that its primary exposure from the year issue lies in its product test equipment  major suppliers and subcontractors 
failure to properly address these exposures for year compliance could result in delays in product deliveries during the period immediately following december  the company is currently assessing the extent to which its operations are vulnerable from interactions with its vendors  customers and financial institutions should those organizations fail to properly remediate their systems 
while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it manufactures and sells 
the above discussion regarding costs  risks and estimated completion dates for the year is based on the company s best estimates given information that is currently available and is subject to change 
as the company proceeds with this project  it may discover that actual results will differ materially from these estimates 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  because revenues generated from operations and licensing have been insufficient to fund operations  the company has depended for funding principally on its stockholders  and in particular from until february on oren l 
benton benton  a former principal stockholder and director and the former chief executive officer of the company  and from through on the national electrical benefit fund the fund  a principal stockholder of the company 
benton and the fund financed the company s cash flow requirements through equity investments and loans  most of which were subsequently converted into equity 
the company also raised funds through the private placement of convertible preferred stock in  all of which has been converted into common stock 
in  the company entered into a million loan facility between the company and the fund 
the company s borrowings under the fund s credit facility  including outstanding principal and accrued interest  totaled approximately million as of december  pursuant to the terms of the fund s credit facility  no additional borrowings are available to the company under the credit facility 
in december  the company sold approximately million of common stock  and in february  the company sold approximately million of series a convertible preferred stock  to certain institutional investors in separate private placements in order to obtain funds for working capital and general corporate purposes 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million in to million 
the company generated million from financing activities in  which was offset by the use of million in operating activities and million in investing activities 
the million generated from financing activities resulted from million of proceeds generated from the sale of preferred stock in a private placement in february the use of million for investing activities was for the purchase of computer and test equipment used in the design and testing of the company s fram and edram products and for intellectual property related activities 
receivables decreased by million in from million at the end of to 
million at the end of the decrease in the receivables balance is primarily due to the collection of a million receivable in january resulting from a fram license agreement completed in december receivables from product sales decreased at the end of as a result of reduced edram product sales during the last two months of inventories decreased by in from million at the end of to million at the end of inventory levels decreased as of the end of as the company decreased its production of megabit edram products to coincide with megabit edram sales volumes 
ibm will continue to supply megabit edram products for the company during and siemens will supply the company s megabit esdram products 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased slightly on a year over year basis from million at the end of to million at the end of this decrease resulted primarily from work in process decreases during the fourth quarter of associated edram manufacturing 
during  the company invested million in computer and test equipment and intellectual property activities 
this was an increase of approximately over and resulted primarily from growth in the company s new fram foundry activities and from edram related patent costs 
expenditures for intellectual property purposes are expected to increase during fabrication equipment and plant expenditures are expected to be minimal during as the company shifts its manufacturing of fram products to its fram alliance partners 
during  the company received approximately million in cash relating to a december fram licensing agreement 
payments pursuant to existing licensing agreements and new licensing agreements are expected to create additional cash flows during and  subject to the fulfillment of certain milestone conditions with existing license agreements 
an increase in product sales activity and customer sponsored research and development revenues is anticipated in based on the company s capital resources as of december  and the expected operating costs and cash flows from product sales and licensing revenues  the company expects to be able to fund its operations through year end all amounts outstanding under the fund s credit facility  repayment of which is secured by liens on the company s facility and certain other of its assets  are due and payable on april  the company has requested a long term extension of the payment date or conversion into equity of amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
if such extension is not granted and the conversion into equity is not made by the fund  the company will have to repay all principal and accrued interest under the credit facility  which will use a substantial portion of the company s capital resources  however  the assets pledged as collateral under the fund credit facility would be released and available as security to new lenders 
conversions of the preferred stock were suspended in october in order to obtain authorization from common shareholders for new shares to satisfy future conversions of preferred stock  the company mailed a proxy statement on or about february   for a meeting to be held on march   which was subsequently cancelled 
as a result of negotiations with preferred shareholders and on advice of its financial advisor  on march   the company filed a preliminary proxy statement with respect to a special meeting of stockholders for a meeting to be held in late april see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
this preliminary proxy statement is now being reviewed by the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec 
pursuant to restructuring proposal of the proxy statement  the proposal provides for cash exchange rights to be given to each of the outstanding preferred shareholders 
the cash exchange rights provide the preferred shareholders with the option of receiving in cash of the face value of the preferred stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
the amount of cash the company will need to make available to effect the cash exchange pursuant to the restructuring is million 
the company is currently unable to determine if proposal will be voted on positively at the special meeting of shareholders  and if so voted  if the preferred shareholders will choose to exercise their cash exchange rights 
if all outstanding preferred shareholders exercised their cash exchange rights to the maximum million available pursuant to the proposal  such exercises would use a substantial portion of the company s capital resources 
the company has litigation outstanding with two of its preferred shareholders seeking certain monetary damages and the reimbursement of costs and attorneys fees see litigation deere park and talisman 
there can be no assurance that the company will ultimately prevail in these cases 
a successful action by either party could use a substantial portion of the company s capital resources 
the company is currently involved in a patent interference proceeding see patent interference proceeding 
if the company is ultimately unsuccessful in these proceedings  there would be no retroactive cash payment requirements from the company to the junior party as a result of such an adverse decision 
in view of the company s expected future working capital requirements in connection with the manufacturing  production and sale of its fram and edram products  the company s projected continuing research and development expenditures  the possible fulfillment of the above mentioned cash exchange rights  results of litigation and the current repayment requirements of the fund s credit facility  the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing after there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the company  or that the fund will agree to an extension of the payment date  or conversion into equity of amounts owed  under the fund credit facility 
if the company requires additional financing in the future and if financing acceptable to the company is not available  the company would not be able to implement its current business strategy and the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial positions  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating activities 
the company s only derivative is an embedded written option on its common stock price issued to an investor to acquire common stock in a private placement 
the common stock price adjustment is a fixed amount at december  and will not be effected by future market changes 
the cash redemption price of the option is now fixed at 
per share 
future changes in the price of the underlying common stock will have no effect on earnings or cash flows 
interest payable on the company s note payable to a related party is fixed  and  therefore  will not effect future earnings or cash flows 
the company manages interest rate risk by investing its excess cash in cash equivalents bearing variable interest rates  which are tied to various market indices 
the company does not believe that near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
the net effect of a change in interest rates on outstanding cash and cash equivalents and debt at december  would have less than an  effect on the fair value of the debt and earnings or cash flows 
the company has a wholly owned subsidiary located in japan 
the operating costs of this subsidiary are denominated in japanese yen  thereby creating exposures to exchange rate changes 
to date  this subsidiary has had only limited operations and is expected to continue to have limited operations in the foreseeable future  and  therefore  the company does not believe any changes in exchange rates will have a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
the company also purchases certain of its fram products from foundry suppliers in japan with such costs denominated in japanese yen  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the japan us exchange rate may positively or negatively effect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company  and therefore  the company has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in japanese currency valuation 
average selling prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to intense competition within the semiconductor industry 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through improvements in production efficiencies 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures within the industry and markets the company participates in
