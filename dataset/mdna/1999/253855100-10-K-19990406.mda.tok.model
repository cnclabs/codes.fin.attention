item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report contains certain statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future performance of the company 
prospective and current investors are cautioned that such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating such statements as well as the future prospects of the company generally  such investors should specifically consider various factors identified in this report on form k  including the matters set forth therein under the caption factors that may affect operating results  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
factors that may affect the company s results of operations include but are not limited to the company s limited operating history and cumulative losses  dependence on limited products  uncertain market acceptance of planned products  rapid technological change  dependence on new product introductions  competition  expansion of manufacturing operations  dependence on contract manufacturing and sole or limited source suppliers  dependence on key personnel  management of growth  anticipated fluctuations in operating results  dependence on proprietary technology  customer concentration  product certifications  control by principal stockholder  factors inhibiting takeover  shares eligible for future sale  possible volatility of stock price  success in defending significant litigation  liquidity risks and future capital needs  potential year problems and government regulations 
the company participates in a highly concentrated industry  and has limited visibility with regard to customer orders and the timing of such orders 
the company may also encounter difficulty obtaining sufficient supplies to staff and meet production schedules 
as a result  quarter to quarter and year to year financial performance is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of orders from its customers during fiscal periods 
overview digital lightwave designs  develops  markets and supports diagnostic products that monitor  maintain and manage fiber optic based networks 
the company s products provide telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers with capabilities to cost effectively deploy and manage fiber optic networks to address the rapidly increasing demand for bandwidth 
from inception in through  the company focused its primary activities on developing the necessary technology and infrastructure required to launch its first product  the network information computer 
the company had no sales until february  when it began shipping the network information computer 
as of december   the company had sold  network information computers to approximately customers such as mci worldcom  ameritech corporation  tellabs  qwest  gte and at t corporation 
in  the company commenced limited sales of the network access agent 
net sales for the company were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s net sales are generated from sales of its products  less an estimate for customer returns 
net sales are recognized when products are shipped to a customer 
the average sales price asp of the network information computer was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company expects that the asp of its network information computers will fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including product configuration  potential volume discounts to customers  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements and the introduction of competitive products 
because the cost of goods sold tends to remain relatively stable for any given product  fluctuations in the asp may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company sells its products through a direct sales force to telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers 
the sales cycle for new customers tends to be long 
in addition  the telecommunications industry historically has had a limited number of competitors 
given long sales cycles and few industry participants  sales of the company s products have tended to be concentrated  and the company expects that sales will continue to be concentrated in the future 
for the year ended december   the company s four largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues  with qwest  mci worldcom  tellabs  and gte accounting for approximately   and of total sales  respectively 
for the year ended december   sales to the company s five largest customers comprised of its total revenues  with worldcom  inc prior to its acquisition of mci communications corporation and its subsidiaries accounting for of total sales 
for the year ended december   the company s five largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues  with mci communications corporation prior to its acquisition by worldcom  inc  ameritech corporation and pacific telesis group accounting for  and of total sales  respectively 
no other customers accounted for sales of or more during such periods 
there can be no assurance regarding the amount or timing of purchases by any customer in any future period 
see factors that may affect operating results we are dependent on a limited number of major customers 
to date  the company has not entered into long term agreements or blanket purchase orders for the sale of its products  but generally obtains purchase orders for immediate shipment and other cancelable purchase commitments 
as a result  the company does not expect to carry substantial quarterly backlog from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s sales during a particular quarter are  therefore  highly dependent upon orders placed by customers during the quarter 
consequently  sales may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and amount of orders from customers  among other factors 
because most of our expenses  particularly employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed and cannot be reduced in response to decreased revenues  quarterly fluctuations in sales have a significant effect on net income 
since inception the company has incurred substantial net operating losses as a result of significant investment in research and development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for tax purposes 
the company intends to continue to build its organization in anticipation of growth and believes that its operating expenses will continue to increase accordingly due to a variety of factors including increased research and development expenses associated with the completion of the products in development and the continued enhancement of existing products  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses associated with continued expansion of sales and marketing capabilities  product advertising and promotion 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve profitability  or that if profitability is achieved that it will be sustained 
in january  the company restated its revenues from the second and third quarters of fiscal the company s decision to restate the results of operations resulted from the discovery of certain errors in the timing of revenue recognition and a review of related accounting policies and procedures 
a committee consisting of the outside members of the company s board of directors was established to review the policies  procedures and circumstances which may have been factors in the restatement of revenue and made recommendations regarding the adoption of appropriate revenue recognition policies and procedures 
in april  class action lawsuits which were subsequently consolidated into a single action were filed against the company arising out of such restatement and alleged violations of the federal securities laws 
the company has a proposed settlement pending in connection with the class action and recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of as a result of the proposed settlement 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement  the company will pay million in cash  which payment will be primarily funded by the company s directors and officers liability insurance policy  and issue million shares of common stock of the company  all of which may be freely tradable 
in late october  a stipulation of settlement was filed with the court and on december   the court preliminarily approved the settlement 
on march   the court indicated that it would grant final approval of the settlement 
the settlement is subject to appeal 
see factors that may affect operating results we are defending significant litigation  note and of the consolidated financial statements  and item legal proceedings 
during february  the company entered into a stock purchase option the option with a former stockholder to repurchase the  shares of the then outstanding class of common stock held by the former stockholder for a purchase price of million 
the purchase price was subsequently reduced to  on november   the company exercised the option and retired the shares of treasury stock acquired 
in november  the former stockholder commenced an action in the united states district court alleging violations of section b of the securities exchange act  violations of state corporation statutes  and various common law violations in connection with the exercise of the option 
on october   the company and dr 
zwan entered into an agreement with plaintiff to settle the action 
the settlement agreement provides  among other things  for dismissal of the action with prejudice  for a  payment by the company to plaintiff for his attorneys fees and grants plaintiff an option  for years  to purchase for per share million shares of dr 
zwan s stock in the company 
pursuant to that agreement  the action was dismissed with prejudice on november  the company recorded a million charge to earnings consisting of the cash payment and the valuation of the options upon settlement 
see factors that may affect operating results we are defending significant litigation and note of the consolidated financial statements and item legal proceedings 
in order to decrease costs and improve operating efficiencies  the company began streamlining its management and operating structure in february and eliminated full time positions resulting in a one time charge of million in connection with this restructuring 
additionally  the company eliminated approximately full time positions in august which did not result in a significant charge to earnings 
during  the company also significantly enhanced its management team by hiring new executives  including a new president and chief executive officer hired at the end of the year 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses engineering and development expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses reorganization and litigation charges total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net net loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales net sales include total revenues from customer purchases of network information computers and  to a limited extent  network access agents  net of accrual for product returns 
net sales for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal sales to existing customers for the year represented of sales  or million as compared to of sales  or million for fiscal during fiscal  the company shipped units of the network information computer in varying configurations at an asp of  compared with units at an asp of  for fiscal sales to existing customers continue to represent a large portion of the company s net sales 
the company believes repeat sales to an existing customer are an important measure of growing product acceptance in the highly concentrated telecommunications industry 
while this longer term trend may not continue  management believes that new product offerings including upgrades of existing products offer the company s existing customers an opportunity to continue to extend the life of their initial investment in the company s products 
cost of goods sold costs of goods sold principally includes inventory  labor and overhead  management costs  facility rental and depreciation of equipment 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  increased by million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales in fiscal the primary reason for the increase in cost of goods sold is the increase in the volume of units sold 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million last year 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin for the year ended december  decreased to from in the increase in gross profit is directly related to the increase in sales for the year ended december  despite the increase in sales  gross margin percentages have decreased for the year 
the primary reason for the decline is the relatively flat asp burdened with a higher average cost per unit in the higher average cost per unit was affected by the introduction of the new oc configuration which costs more to produce than the lower speed optical configurations and the sale of units produced in previous periods requiring additional labor and overhead costs in order to provide the customer with the most current configuration available 
engineering and development engineering and development expenses principally include compensation attributable to engineering and development personnel  depreciation of production assets  outside consulting fees and other development expenses 
engineering and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  last year 
the increase is primarily related to the ongoing engineering and development efforts on products such as the network access agents  and enhancements to the company s network information computers most significantly  the oc option 
in addition  during the last two quarters of  the company incurred a significant level of overhead costs that could not be absorbed into inventory production due to a lower level of production activity during the last six months 
although the company s efforts to lower overhead costs by reducing the number of manufacturing personnel were successful  some fixed costs such as facility rental and depreciation of production assets could not be reduced 
accordingly  a disproportionate share of overhead expenses could not be capitalized as part of inventory costs 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses principally include salaries and commissions paid on sales of products  travel expenses  tradeshow costs  and costs of promotional materials and customer incentives 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million last year

general and administrative general and administrative expenses principally include professional fees  facility rentals  compensation  and information systems related to general management functions 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million last year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses declined to  from in the dollar increase is primarily due to professional fees associated with outstanding litigation and various legal matters 
these fees increased approximately million for the year ended december  reorganization charges during the year ended december   the company has actively pursued streamlining its management and operating structure 
during the first quarter  the company focused on its management structure and eliminated positions which resulted in a one time charge of approximately million 
in august  the company streamlined its operating structure by eliminating approximately full time positions which did not result in a material charge to earnings 
the company believes that these reductions in force did not materially affect the company s ability to operate 
litigation settlement the company signed a memorandum of understanding and a stipulation of settlement for the settlement of class action complaints filed against it in us district court for alleged violations of federal securities laws 
the settlement has resulted in a charge of approximately million recorded during the second quarter of in addition  dr 
bryan zwan and the company entered into an agreement to settle an action commenced by hugh brian haney 
pursuant to that agreement  the action was dismissed with prejudice on november  the company recorded a non cash charge to earnings of approximately million and a million accrual of related legal expenses during the fourth quarter of other income expense other income for the year ended december  decreased by million to million from million last year 
the decrease is the result of the utilization of cash reserves to fund the company s operations which caused a decrease in interest earned on invested cash balances 
net loss net loss for the year ended december  increased by million to a net loss of million or per share  from a net loss of million or 
per share in the increase in net loss for the year ended december  was adversely impacted by the charges of approximately million to record the settlement of outstanding securities litigation  million to record the settlement of the haney litigation  million to record the reorganization  million in legal expenses  and million of other special charges 
without these charges  the pro forma net loss would have been million or a loss of

the primary reason for the increase in cost of goods sold in relates to the increase in volume of units produced and the increased infrastructure and manufacturing costs incurred in supporting these efforts 
while the overall cost of goods sold has increased  the average cost of goods sold per unit has declined as a result of absorption of fixed production costs over a larger volume of units produced and the component cost reductions associated with the purchase of larger lot sizes 
during the quarter ended september   the company moved its manufacturing operation to a new expanded facility and the company recorded certain non recurring expenses in connection with this move 
gross profit gross profit in increased by million to million from million in as a percentage of sales  gross margin for the years ended december  and was 
as highlighted above  the increase in gross profit in is directly related to the increase in sales 
engineering and development engineering and development expenses in increased by million to million  or of net sales from million  or of net sales  in the increase is primarily related to the addition of engineering and quality control personnel and the other expenses associated with the company s ongoing research and development efforts on products such as the network access agents and enhancements to the company s network information computers

liquidity and capital resources from its inception through december   the company has financed its operations primarily through private sales of its common stock  cash from operations and the initial public offering of  shares of its common stock 
the company completed its ipo in february  resulting in net proceeds to the company of million 
during  the company used the net proceeds to fund the repayment of notes payable for approximately million  to purchase computer equipment  software  test equipment and other assets for approximately million and to fund product research and development for approximately million 
in addition  approximately million was used to fund the company s expansion in the form of additional manufacturing and administrative space and a significant increase in engineering  production and financial management personnel to support the company s growth 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were approximately million compared to approximately million at december  as of december   the company s working capital was approximately million as compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily associated with cash used in operations as a result of operating losses during the fiscal year ended december   as detailed in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows  and the proposed settlement of the litigation previously discussed 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were approximately million 
future capital expenditures will depend on several factors including timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products as well as continued product development efforts

year readiness disclosure year issues and state of readiness the company is aware of the issues associated with existing computer controlled systems properly recognizing and processing information relating to dates in and after the year systems that cannot adequately process dates beyond the year could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the problem may affect internal information technology it systems used by the company for product development  accounting  distribution and planning 
the problem may also affect non it embedded systems such as building security systems  machine controllers  and other equipment 
the company has made a preliminary assessment of its year readiness for its operations relating to the company s software products  the company s internal it and non it systems and third party customers  vendors and others with whom the company does business 
the company believes that the current versions of its products asa network information computer software versions and later and network access agents are year compliant 
the company s products use time and dates only as a time stamp for data logging events  for file dates  for display of elapsed time  and setting the test duration 
the products internal system calendar years are entered as a digit number in the range of for through for 
since there is never a reason for back dating  this provides an unambiguous means of entry for the year 
the date is displayed in a digit year format eg  jan to enhance understandability 
based on the foregoing  it is not expected that the company s current products will be adversely affected by date changes in the year certain customers of the company may be running earlier versions of the company s products that are not year compliant 
these earlier software versions  like the compliant versions  rely on time and dates only as a time stamp for data logging events  for file dates  for display of elapsed time  and setting the test duration and do not prohibit function of the equipment 
the company has made its policy statement regarding its product line available on the internet as well as providing written copies at customer request 
this alerts customers to the noncompliance of earlier versions of the asa software 
of these earlier versions  through prior to partially comply  although if allowed to run past and into january   the date after power down will be incorrectly set to instructions regarding correcting this are provided both on the internet and via customer inquiry 
this leaves only versions lower than which are truly non compliant 
the suggested solution for these products is an upgrade to a more recent  compliant version of the software at the cost of the company 
the company has evaluated the number of customers still operating with these non compliant versions 
of these customers  it is estimated that approximately half have already received the desired upgrades 
as of march   the cost to upgrade the remaining units is estimated to total  which would not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
with respect to it systems  the company has inventoried its internal software and electronic hardware devices currently in use to determine which of these devices rely on a valid date in order to function 
of these  certain operating  accounting  and telephony systems were identified as critical 
resources required to make these systems year compliant were evaluated based on availability and cost of the related upgrade 
in general  the company is obtaining year compliant versions from third party software vendors and modifying these systems  which the company expects to complete during the second quarter of total costs of such remediation are estimated at  non it embedded systems  consisting primarily of security systems  the emergency power generator  hvac controls and elevators have also been reviewed 
these systems were found to be year compliant 
the company also has certain key relationships with suppliers and subcontractors 
we are preparing to contact certain third party suppliers of key components or services regarding their year readiness 
following completion of contacting these vendors  the company will be better able to make a complete evaluation of the costs associated with identifying alternative vendors if the need arises 
risks associated with year and contingency plan based on information currently available to the company  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios with respect to the company relate to the potential failure of third party suppliers  subcontractors and customers to become year compliant 
the inability of suppliers and subcontractors to complete their year remediation processes in a timely fashion could result in delays in introducing new products  reduced sales of new or existing products and disruptions in any future strategic relationships 
the failure of these entities to become year compliant could in turn have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the effect of non compliance by suppliers  subcontractors and customers is not reasonably quantifiable 
the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues 
many companies are expending significant resources to correct or upgrade their current systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase testing products such as those offered by the company 
this could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company anticipates that generally throughout the computer industry substantial litigation may be brought against software vendors of non compliant operating environments 
the company believes that any such claims against the company  with or without merit  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company currently does not have any year contingency plan 
the most significant aspect of any such plan would involve the ability of the company to identify alternative vendors if the need arose 
the company believes it has that ability 
the company is not aware of any year compliance problems relating to its current products or its it or non it systems that would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
however  the company may discover year problems in its products that will require substantial revisions 
in addition  third party software or hardware incorporated into the company s products and material it and non it systems may need to be revised or replaced  all of which could be time consuming and expensive 
if material year problems are discovered  the failure of the company to fix its products or fix or replace third party software  third party software incorporated into its products and in its it systems could result in lost revenues  increased operating costs  the loss of customers and other business interruptions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial conditions 
expenses related to year compliance the total cost of the year preparedness effort is funded through operating cash flows and the company is expensing these costs 
the company has not established any specific reserves for these costs 
the company has not incurred significant expense in becoming year compliant as both the majority of our product software and the infrastructure of our internal systems were developed after the year risks were realized 
future costs related to year compliance are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  the company may experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which are composed predominantly of third party software and hardware technology with embedded software  and the company s own products
