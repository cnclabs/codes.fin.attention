the company believes that the cost of such upgrades will be immaterial 
the company believes it will not experience any material year problems from most of its major vendors and suppliers  however  the company is unable to determine whether certain suppliers  principally the company s utilities providers  will likely be year ready in time

internal use software effective january   the company adopted  as required  statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
prior to the adoption of sop  the company expensed the costs of internally developed proprietary software as it was incurred 
sop  effective for fiscal periods beginning after december   requires that certain costs for the development of internal use software should be capitalized  including the costs of coding  software configuration  upgrades and enhancements 
based on internal software development plans  the company estimates that million to million of costs related to the development of internal use software could be capitalized for the year ending december   net of related amortization 
these costs  which have been previously expensed  will be amortized under the company s current policy on a straight line basis  depending on the nature of the project  generally over a three to five year period beginning on the date such software is placed in service 
the estimated range of capitalizable development costs for internal use software reflects the company s current views 
there may be differences between these estimates and actual development costs  and those differences may be material 
seasonality generally  the company does not have significant seasonal fluctuations in its business operations 
processing and output solutions volumes for mutual fund customers are usually highest during the quarter ended march due primarily to processing year end transactions and printing and mailing of year end statements and tax forms during january

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the operations of its businesses  the company s financial results can be affected by changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and equity pricing 
changes in interest rates and exchange rates have not materially impacted the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company

interest rate risk at december   the company had million of long term debt  of which million was subject to variable interest rates federal funds rates  libor rates  prime rates 
the company estimates that a increase in interest rates would not be material to the company s consolidated pretax earnings for or to the fair value of its debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of the company s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
the principal currencies involved are the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the british pound 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the financial results of international operations into us dollars does not now materially affect  and has not historically materially affected  the consolidated financial results of the company 
the company s international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency 
the company translates all assets and liabilities at year end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year 
while it is generally not the company s practice to enter into derivative contracts  from time to time the company and its subsidiaries do utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of currency movements 
equity price risk the company s investments in available for sale equity securities are subject to price risk 
the fair value of such investments  as of december  was approximately billion 
the potential change in the fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices would be approximately million on a pretax basis 
as discussed under comprehensive income in item above  net unrealized gains on the company s investments in available for sale securities have had a material effect on the company s comprehensive income and financial position
