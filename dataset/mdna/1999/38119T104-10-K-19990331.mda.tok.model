the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian gaap 
for the us gaap reconciliation  see attached consolidated financial statements  as well as results of operations below 
cautionary statement for purposes of reform act the following contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
actual results  performance or achievements of the company could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
results of operations overview the company s current business activity focus is the exploration and development if warranted of precious metal and diamond deposits within specific geological domains 
under canadian gaap  expenditures relating to these activities are capitalized in recognition of the potential future value of prospective targets 
upon completion of the exploration phase  a decision to proceed to the development phase requires that these expenditures reflect the cost of the resultant reserves and be depleted on the unit of production basis over the estimated total reserve to be mined 
a decision to discontinue exploration or not to proceed to the development stage for a specific project would result in reducing the capitalized total cost of the exploration program and charging those costs against income 
as such  reported net income or loss for the company may be volatile and principally represents investment revenues received through the investment of idle funds  the surplus received on redemption of preferred shares in ogml held by the company  and other revenues  as offset by those expenditures which cannot be directly attributed to a specific project and those costs for projects the company has elected to abandon 
under us gaap  exploration and general and administrative expenses related to projects are charged to expense as incurred  whereas under canadian gaap  such expenses are capitalized as discussed above 
property acquisition costs are deferred for both canadian and us gaap until it is determined whether a project is commercially feasible 
in addition  under us gaap  compensation expense is recorded for the excess of the quoted market price over the option price granted to employees and directors at the date of grant under stock option plans 
under canadian gaap  no compensation expense is recorded for such awards 
the gains on issuance of subsidiary s common stock recorded under canadian gaap in respect of the parc and guyanor equity financings would not be recorded under us gaap 
under us gaap  accrued severance and social charges resulting from the shut down of alluvial mining operations at sotrapmag would not have been recorded as of december   as the requirements for accrual were not satisfied 
the effect of the differences in accounting under canadian gaap and us gaap on the statement of net loss is as follows for the years ended december  net loss under canadian gaap    net effect of the deferred exploration expenditures on loss for the period    effect of recording compensation expense under stock option plans foreign exchange loss reversal of the gain on subsidiary s issuance of common stock  reversal of the loss for severance accruals   effect of omai preferred share redemption  loss under us gaap before minority interest    minority interest as adjusted    net loss under us gaap    other comprehensive income foreign exchange loss comprehensive income    basic and diluted net loss per share under us gaap the company currently has limited cash resources

year compliance the company recognizes the importance of ensuring that its business operations are not disrupted as a result of year problems 
the company has prepared a three step plan to identify and resolve year issues 
first  the company is compiling an inventory of its information technology it systems  and non it systems which are those which typically include embedded technology such as microprocessors or chips and performing a survey of the state of year readiness of third party suppliers  vendors  joint venture partners and ogml 
second  the company is prioritizing the it and non it systems and vendor responses 
third  the company has prepared a year testing plan to assess the ability of it and non it systems to handle the year those systems that are not year compliant are being modified or replaced to ensure that they are year compliant 
these steps are in various stages of completion 
the company anticipates that all steps will be completed by june  the company estimates the internal and external cost of year compliance to be approximately million 
the company believes that the greatest risk presented by the year problem is from third parties  such as suppliers and financial institutions who may not have adequately addressed the problem 
a failure of any such third party s computer or other applicable systems in sufficient magnitude could materially and adversely impact the company 
the company is not presently able to quantify this risk but believes that it is minimal based upon the survey responses received to date from third party suppliers  vendors  joint venture partners and ogml 
the company is undertaking a contingency planning effort to identify alternatives that could be used to mitigate the effects of year related failures 
the company keeps printed back up of all material transactions which could facilitate the continuation of business operations and remediation of data loss in the event of a system failure 
effects of the european monetary union currency effective january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european monetary union emu adopted a single european currency  the euro  as their common legal currency 
during the next three years  business conducted within the emu will be conducted in both the existing national currency and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handle these currencies  including the euro 
the operations of the company s owned subsidiary guyanor ressources sa are affected by this change 
the company has not had and does not expect a material impact on its results of operations from foreign currency gains or losses as a result of the transition to the euro 
other matters the company conducts all of its exploration and development of mineral properties in countries other than canada and the united states directly and through joint ventures 
to date  the vast majority of all funding has been through equity financing transactions completed in canada and in canadian currency with the exception of the guyanor offering of its class b shares on the nouveau marche in france and the us million raised by the company in may 
the company currently maintains all or the majority of its working capital in us dollars or us dollar denominated securities and converts funds to foreign currencies as payment obligations come due 
accordingly  the company is subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the us dollar and these currencies  and such fluctuations may materially affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company currently has future obligations which are payable in french francs and receivables collectible in french francs 
the company currently does not actively take steps to hedge against such risks 
the company also utilizes the services of outside advisors who provide the company with market information and strategies to employ in protecting the cash and short term investments held by the company 
the company believes that its current activities are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations designed to protect the environment  except to the extent that non compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
the company periodically engages specialists to evaluate potential environmental issues for specific projects 
the results of these evaluations are utilized in the property evaluation process  where applicable 
the company also evaluates the need for reclamation reserves in light of current laws and regulations and will make provisions for such reserves as they become necessary based on the company s activities in africa and south america 
outlook the company must rely primarily on the capital markets to fund its operations and exploration activities until it can achieve sustained positive cash flow from mining operations 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital to fund its exploration and development efforts 
the current market for gold shares is weak and equity capital is difficult to obtain 
the company anticipates that additional capital will be required in in order to fund operations and exploration activities 
the company is exploring various transactions which would enable it to have sufficient capital to continue its operations 
various transactions being considered include mergers with other companies  acquisitions  and the issuance of new equity 
other sources for such capital may include  among other things  the establishment of joint ventures and sale of property interests 
if the current depressed market for gold prices and gold shares continues into  it may be necessary for the company to modify its budget to achieve further reductions in activity and general and administrative expenses 
capital is allocated to those projects which in the opinion of management  offer the greatest potential to generate additional reserves and mineralized material 
a significant portion of the exploration and development expenditures for the company and its subsidiaries represent discretionary spending and can be adjusted to reflect  among other things  results of exploration and development activities and the company s capital resources 
in  the company is required to make property rental payments and minimum exploration expenditures totaling million in order to maintain its current property interests per existing mineral agreements 
the company is negotiating the reduction or deferral of these payments where possible 
whether and to what extent alternative financing options are completed by the company or its subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors including  among others  the successful acquisition of additional properties or projects  the price of gold and management s assessment of the capital markets 
the low gold price adversely affects our ability to obtain financing and therefore our abilities to develop our current portfolio of properties 
we cannot assure you that additional funding will be available in this situation affects our flexibility to invest funds in exploration and development 
we may  in the future  be unable to continue our exploration and development programs and fulfill our obligations under our agreements with our partners or under or permits and licenses 
although we have been successful in the past in obtaining financing though partnership arrangements and sale of equity securities  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to obtain such additional financing  we may need to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development of our properties 
as a result we may lose our interest in some of our properties and may be obliged to sell some or our properties 
as at december   the company held consolidated cash and short term investments of million 
management anticipates consolidated total expenditures of million for  with consolidated net expenditures after recoveries from joint venture partners and other working capital changes of approximately million 
the company has committed  subject to the availability of adequate funding  to continue funding on a reasonable best efforts basis the operations of guyanor  in the amount of million which amount is included in the net spending of million 
without a financing or other capital raising transaction such as a sale of assets  and based on the current budget  management expects the company will have a consolidated cash of position of million as of december  absent any additional financings or transactions in this would materially and adversely affect our operations and our ability to continue as a going concern 
the company s planned spending during is anticipated to be directed primarily toward pre feasibility work at the yaou and dorlin projects  exploration work at paul isnard and st elie in french guiana  and abacaxis in brazil  continued engineering work at gross rosebel in suriname 
no field work is planned for gross rosebel  however expenditures have been budgeted for additional work on the feasibility study related to engineering and metallurgical work for to the investigation of heap leaching alternatives and ongoing holding costs of the project 
the company does not expect to receive cash flow from ogml in through redemptions of class i preferred shares as any redemptions will be utilized to reduce the debt owed to ogml 
the amount of redemptions  if any  is dependent on the net cash flow of ogml 
the company received million from redemptions of class i preferred shares in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is limited to changes in interest rates on the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments 
the company invests its cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers  and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
