item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating results general for the year ended december   the company earned million  or per diluted share 
by comparison  the company earned million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   and earned million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the results for included an extraordinary item of million incurred in connection with the early repayment  and the accelerated write off of unamortized issue costs and discounts  of the senior notes  due  and series a preferred stock 
the results for included a pretax gain of million in connection with the sale of certain of the company s deposits and retail banking offices  and a pre tax charge of million in connection with the one time recapitalization of the saif 
the results for and were substantially benefited by the recognition of income tax benefits which totaled  respectively  million and million 
the results for included an income tax provision of million

as illustrated in the preceding table  bank core earnings are earnings before interest on parent company debt ie  senior notes  income taxes  real estate operations and non operating items 
during the three years ended december   bank core earnings have increased to million from million 
this substantial growth in bank core earnings has resulted from the growth in the bank s earning assets  a widening of the bank s effective interest margin  and a continuing reduction in nonaccruing loans 
the growth in the bank s earning assets has resulted directly from the continuing successful development of the company s real estate secured financing businesses 
during  the company generated net new loan commitments of million which  net of repayments and disbursed loan funds  produced net loan growth of million for the year 
by comparison  the company recorded net new loan commitments of million and million during and  respectively  which  net of repayments and undisbursed loan funds  produced net loan growth of million in and million in in conjunction with the growth in the bank s earning assets  the bank s effective interest margin has continued to widen  reaching during as compared with during and during the growth in the bank s effective interest margin which excludes the impact of interest paid on the company s senior notes has resulted primarily from the increasing share of the bank s loan portfolio represented by higher yielding loans originated during the period through nonperforming assets npas  which consist of the carrying value of properties acquired through foreclosure and loan principal delinquent three or more payments  have declined from million at december   to million at december  based upon the actual amount and duration of nonaccruing loans outstanding during each of the three years ended december   which is a broader measure of the impact of troubled loans on the company s earnings performance  approximately million  million and million  of interest revenues otherwise contractually payable to the company and associated with nonaccruing loans were not recognized as revenue 
in mid  management commenced a series of initiatives designed to enhance the company s management depth  to expand its loan origination capabilities  to convert its technology platform from an outsourced  host based system to an in house  client server based system  and to design and to implement a plan to ensure year compliance 
these and related initiatives served to increase the company s non interest expense during  as compared with their level during and in  non interest expense costs were million  an increase of million  or  over non interest expense costs of million incurred during  and an increase of million  or  over non interest expense costs of million incurred during for  the company s effective tax rate was  which reflected utilization of substantially all of the company s remaining federal income tax benefits during the year 
by comparison  the company recorded income tax benefits of million in and million in  which reflected the company s utilization of income tax benefits 
these income tax benefits  which consisted principally of tax loss carryforwards  accumulated during the early s  a period during which the company incurred substantial losses 
net interest income the company recorded net interest income of million  million and million in   and respectively  representing increases of and in and the resulting net interest margin increased during the three years from in to and in and there are two contributing factors to net interest income  namely interest income  which increased in by million as compared to  and which increased million in compared to the other factor is interest expense  which increased million in compared to and million in compared to the primary reason for the million increase to interest income in compared to  is that average loans  the highest yielding category of interest earning assets  increased by million resulting in an increase in interest income of million 
loans averaged of the company s interest earning assets during compared to in interest rate variances had an insignificant impact on the increase in interest income during this positive impact to net interest income was somewhat offset by the increase in interest expense of million 
the increase was due primarily to an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million  which resulted in an increase to interest expense of million 
this however was partially mitigated by the reduction in rates paid on short term borrowings and on the senior notes which averaged and in compared to and in  respectively 
these lower rates reduced the interest expense by thousand and the reduction resulting from the lower rate and volume together was million during as compared to the resulting net interest margin was during which is basis points more than in and basis points more than in the average yield on earning assets increased by basis points during compared to  while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points 
the ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities was in compared to in the company s interest income increased by million or during compared to this increase was primarily attributable to increases in the average balance of loans outstanding and to a lesser extent  increases in the weighted average yield earned thereon  the increase in the average balance of loans outstanding during  along with the reduction in real estate owned contributed to an improvement in the ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities which was in compared to in the increase in interest income during was partially offset by a million  or increase in interest expense 
this was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of the company s deposit base and borrowings as well as an increase in the average rates paid on deposits 
interest rates on deposits increased an average of basis points in compared to  while the rates paid on short term borrowings and senior notes remained relatively constant 
the following table sets forth the company s average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the related revenues and costs  and effective weighted average yields and costs  for each of the three years in the period ended december  the interest costs associated with the company s issues of senior notes are included in the table dollars are in thousands

provision for estimated credit losses provisions for estimated credit losses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company s ratio of charge offs to total loans has improved steadily in the past three years from in to in to in additionally  non performing loans to total loans have decreased from in to in despite this improvement in asset quality  the company s provisions for reflected an increase of million  or  over the provision for this increase is primarily attributable to the substantial growth in the loan portfolio during average loans outstanding during increased by million  or  while loan provisions grew by million  or over provisions 
the company routinely adds to its allowance for estimated credit losses through provisions for credit losses 
the company makes recurring provisions at a level deemed by management to be sufficient to absorb the inherent losses in the company s loan portfolio at each measurement date 
because of a continuing decrease in the rate of loan charge offs during  and the very low rate of loan charge offs with respect to loans made by the company since  the rate of growth in the company s loan portfolio during exceeded the rate of growth in its allowance for estimated credit losses 
due to the high volume of loans originated in and the lack of seasoning of these loans and the fact that the company expanded into new loan products in including income property development loans  the company intends to increase provisioning during the company intends to achieve a ratio of the general allowance for estimated credit losses  net of specific reserves  to net loans of by the end of see item business  new business generation  asset quality for a fuller discussion of the company s allowances for estimated credit losses

during  the company s financial performance substantially exceeded targeted thresholds  resulting in the payment of cash bonuses of million  as compared to million in and million in operating costs operating costs principally include the cost of advertising and promotion  the cost of corporate telecommunications  premiums for corporate liability insurance  supplies  and the amortization of prepaid offering costs arising from the recapitalization of the company and 
the increase in operating expenses from to was due primarily to increased advertising and marketing activities 
occupancy costs occupancy costs consist of the expenses related to the operation of the company s corporate facilities  and six branches 
in  the company leased additional space at the el segundo corporate office primarily due to the data processing conversion from an outsourced third party vendor to an internal computer system 
primarily as a result of the increase in facilities leased  occupancy expense increased in over the same period in technology costs technology costs in are principally costs associated with systems conversions from an outsourced third party vendor to an internal system  computer hardware and software maintenance costs  depreciation for computer hardware  amortization of costs related to software  and during the first half of  data processing charges from an outside vendor 
in and  technology costs are primarily related to maintenance and depreciation for computer hardware and data processing service charges from an outside vendor 
technology costs increased from thousand in and thousand in to million in  or an increase of over costs 
professional fees professional fees are paid to outside lawyers  who represent the company in a variety of legal matters  the company s independent accountants  and to various other vendors that provide employee search and miscellaneous consulting services to the company 
a significant portion of the professional fees paid in were legal costs due to the magnitude of the company s foreclosures and related actions against borrowers 
commencing in mid  the company implemented a series of initiatives to increase the depth of its lending management group and to hire programming and supplemental management talent in anticipation of converting the company s core technology to a client server platform from an outsourced  mainframe provider 
the platform conversion  including year compliance initiatives  were substantially completed in a majority of the new personnel hired by the company were sourced through executive search firms 
saif premiums the company pays premiums to the saif based upon the dollar amount of deposits it holds and the assessment rate charged by the fdic  which is based upon the company s financial condition  its capital ratios and the rating it receives in connection with annual regulatory examinations by the ots 
because of the company s improved financial condition  the assessment rate charged by the fdic has decreased during and expenses associated with real estate operations the table below details the revenues and costs associated with the company s real estate owned for the periods indicated dollars are in thousands 
year ended december  expenses associated with real estate owned property taxes repairs  maintenance and renovation insurance total net recoveries from sale of properties    property operations  net  provision for estimated losses on real estate owned  income loss from real estate operations  net   net recoveries from reo sales represent the difference between the proceeds received from the sales and the carrying value of the related reo 
improved market conditions and the sale of large land parcels resulted in increased recoveries in during  and  the company acquired via foreclosure over multi family properties 
this accumulated portfolio of multi family properties was operated by the company over an extended holding period  during which the company renovated the properties and operated the properties for their cash flow return 
commencing in late  and continuing throughout and into early  the company disposed of these properties through retail channels 
accordingly  the net revenues received by the company from this portfolio reflected in the table as property operations  net has declined from to during and  the company recorded additional provisions for estimated losses on reo of million and million  respectively  principally in connection with the completion and liquidation of certain tract developments 
at december   the company had liquidated all of its investments in these tract developments 
income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of million during compared to income tax benefits of million and million  during and  respectively 
the million of income tax benefit recognized during the year ended december   was due to a million increase in the company s deferred tax asset as a result of the reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
partially reducing this benefit was an expected liability of million attributable to the company s profitable operations 
at december   the company had utilized substantially all income tax benefits originated in prior years 
growth in the company experienced substantial net growth in its assets during  primarily because the volume of new loan commitments recorded during the year increased significantly from prior periods  the dollar amount of such commitments was significant in relation to loans outstanding at the beginning of the year  and the company retained virtually all of these commitments for its own account 
this net growth in assets  which approximated during  was supported by the successful issuance of  shares of the common stock in july  which raised net proceeds after offering costs of million  and by net earnings 
at december   approximately million of the net proceeds raised in the offering had been contributed to the bank  and had been fully deployed 
the significant part of the remainder of these net proceeds ie  million is expected to be contributed to the bank during the first half of because the company and the bank will not have excess capital in to the same extent excess capital was available during  management does not expect that growth in the company s assets will approach the percentage growth achieved during  absent the issuance of additional debt or equity securities by the company or the bank

real estate owned real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans is transferred to reo at estimated fair values  less any estimated disposal costs 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the reo after the date of transfer are recorded through the establishment of  or additions to specific reserves 
the company s investment in reo decreased from million to million  or  from year end to year end other assets other assets at year end totaled million  the principal components of which are i the bank s investment in capital stock of the fhlb million  ii a deferred tax asset million  iii and accrued interest receivable million

accounts payable and other liabilities accounts payable and other liabilities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
stockholders equity the company s stockholders equity was million at december   up from million at december  the increase in stockholders equity is composed of earnings retention and the issuance of  shares of common stock in july capital resources and liquidity hawthorne financial had million of cash on hand at december  hawthorne financial is a holding company with no significant business operations outside of the bank 
its requisite obligations which pertain to its debt and operations are dependent upon its sole source of funds which are dividends from the bank 
the company s liquidity position refers to the extent to which the company s funding sources are sufficient to meet its current and long term cash requirements 
federal regulations currently require savings associations to maintain a monthly average daily balance of liquid assets equal to of the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings during the preceding calendar quarter 
the bank had liquidity ratios of and as of december  and  respectively 
the company s current primary funding resources are deposit accounts  principal payments on loans  proceeds from sales of reo  advances from the fhlb and cash flows from operations 
other possible sources of liquidity available to the company include whole loan sales  commercial bank lines of credit  and direct access  under certain conditions  to borrowings from the federal reserve system 
the cash needs of the company are principally for the payment of interest on and withdrawals of deposit accounts  the funding of loans  operating costs and expenses  and holding and refurbishment costs on reo 
year compliance technology data processing conversion 
in july  the company completed a conversion of substantially all of its computer based systems and applications to an in house  client server platform from an outsourced  host based platform  following over two years of planning  design  specification  hardware and software acquisition and resource additions 
the company believes that the new computer based systems and applications will provide it with the information processing  warehousing and reporting capabilities necessary to more efficiently and reliably support its business activities in the future 
year compliance 
the year issue arises because many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in a date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if a bank does not resolve problems related to the year issue  computer systems may incorrectly compute payment  interest  or delinquency information 
in addition  because payment and other important data systems are linked by computer  if the banks or other third parties with which the company conducts ongoing operations do not resolve this potential problem in time  the company may experience significant data processing delays  mistakes or failures 
these delays  mistakes or failures may have a significant adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows of the company 
the company  has adopted and is implementing a plan to address year data processing issues 
the plan includes the assessment of all internal systems  programs and data processing applications with respect to the company  including the new applications which are integral to the conversion of its computer based systems  as well as those provided to the company by third party vendors 
the company has recently completed the process of converting from an outsourced  host based program to an in house client server computer platform 
the company has completed its own year testing by creating a database that rolled forward systematically until the in house computer systems processed data into what it believed was early additionally  the company is establishing contingency plans that will provide for alternative methods of conducting business for critical functions 
these plans are substantially completed with the documentation being refined as a result of the findings during the testing 
the company has conducted an extensive review of all of its third party service providers year compliance and identified ninety nine providers that require additional examination 
in the process  the company identified five core data systems that are third party supported or developed 
all providers have asserted that their systems are compliant 
the company has also identified twenty nine critical service providers non data service related of which six have asserted that they are currently year compliant and five have asserted that will be so by mid the company is developing contingency plans for business continuity for all critical functions 
while the company has received assurances from vendors as to compliance  such assurances are not guarantees and may not be enforceable 
the company  through the bank  extends principally all of its credit on a real estate secured basis 
the company s primary source of repayment is by cash flow of the borrower  although the underlying real estate collateral is the ultimate security 
the company has approximately  loans within its portfolio of assets 
in september  the company initiated an internal scan of its borrower relationships  beginning with an assessment of larger greater than million commercial property loans  whereby it attempted to identify those loans having a business operations component 
within this first priority group  the company has identified at december   loans that total approximately million and have a contractual maturity beyond december  because these loans have business operations aspects  the company believes that they may be more susceptible to year concerns 
the company is taking steps to assess such borrowers year compliance 
if the borrowers fail to be year compliant  the company cannot at this time determine whether such noncompliance would affect their ability to service their debt obligation 
the company continues to assess its exposure related to high risk borrowers that may be adversely impacted by year issues and expects to complete its assessment of such borrowers by june the company has installed year compliant software and hardware as part of a conversion completed in the expense incurred and to be incurred by the company to ensure year compliance is substantially integrated and was included with the expense associated with the planned conversion of its computer based systems 
the company does not anticipate any material additional expenses in related to year software or hardware 
year testing occurs on a continual basis upon receipt of all new releases of year compliant software and hardware 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the bank manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
specific strategies have included shortening the amortized maturity of fixed rate loans and increasing the volume of adjustable rate loans to reduce the average maturity of the bank s interest earning assets 
fhlb advances are used in an effort to extend the effective duration of interest bearing liabilities to better match the repricing sensitivity of interest earning assets 
the bank seeks to control its interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the bank has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
as part of this effort  the bank uses the market value mv methodology  a type of sensitivity analysis  to gauge interest rate risk exposure 
generally  mv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the mv which would result from changes in market interest rates in theoretical increments of basis points  up to basis points in either direction 
at december   according to the ots interest rate risk exposure report  it was estimated that the bank s mv would decrease and in the event of and basis point increases in market interest rates  respectively 
the bank s mv at the same date would increase and in the event of and basis point decreases in market rates  respectively 
presented below  as of december   is an analysis of the bank s mv interest rate risk as measured by changes in mv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of and basis point increments in market interest rates 
such amounts reflect the results of the ots interest rate model using information obtained in the bank s quarterly filing with the ots 
dollars are in thousands as a of the present market value value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp management believes that the mv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows  weighting each by its appropriate discount factor 
second  because the mv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an association s interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
although the bank believes that the results of the ots model presented above do accurately depict the overall risk profile and sensitivity of the bank to changes in interest rates  the most significant limitations of the ots model are its lack of sufficient detailed information concerning repricing frequency and velocity and its use of generic market information concerning discount rates and prepayment speeds which may not precisely predict the behavior of the bank s unique lending portfolio under various interest rate scenarios  both of which result in less precise estimates of mv and sensitivity 
the bank believes that the inclusion of more bank specific information would result in less sensitivity in mv particularly to upward parallel shifts in interest rates than the results depicted in the table above
