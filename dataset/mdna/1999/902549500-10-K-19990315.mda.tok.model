item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section contains forward looking statements which are identified with an asterisk 
factors that could significantly impact the expected results referenced in the forward looking statements are listed in the last paragraph of the section  outlook for on july   the stockholders of ual corporation ual approved a plan of recapitalization that provides an approximately equity and voting interest in ual to certain employees of united air lines  inc united in exchange for wage concessions and work rule changes 
the employees equity interest is being allocated to individual employee accounts through the year under employee stock ownership plans esops which were created as part of the recapitalization 
since the esop shares are being allocated over time  the current ownership interest held in the esops is less than 
the entire esop voting interest is currently exercisable  which is voted by the esop trustee at the direction of  and on behalf of  the holders of the esop stock 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity ual s total of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was million at december   compared to million at december  operating activities during the year generated billion 
cash was used primarily to fund net additions to property and equipment and to repurchase common stock 
property additions  including aircraft  aircraft spare parts  facilities and ground equipment  amounted to billion  while property dispositions resulted in proceeds of million 
in  united took delivery of ten a  sixteen a  four b  two b  four b and five b aircraft 
thirty four of these aircraft were purchased and seven were acquired under capital leases 
eight of the aircraft purchased during the year were later sold and then leased back under capital leases 
additionally  united acquired six b and three dc off lease during and retired twenty eight b  five b and six dc aircraft 
consistent with a plan announced earlier in the year  the company made payments of million for the repurchase of million shares of common stock 
in january  the company completed its repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock after acquiring a total of million shares 
financing activities also included principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations of million and million  respectively and million in aircraft lease deposits with certain banks in connection with the financing of capital lease transactions 
additionally  the company issued million in debt and used part of the proceeds to purchase million in equipment certificates under company operating leases 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  were million of securities held by third parties under securities lending agreements  as well as collateral in the amount of of the value of the securities lent 
united is obligated to reacquire the securities at the end of the contract 
as of december   ual had a working capital deficit of billion as compared to billion at december  historically  ual has operated with a working capital deficit and  as in the past  ual expects to meet all of its obligations as they become due 
in addition  ual may from time to time repurchase on the open market  in privately negotiated purchases or otherwise  its debt and equity securities 
united has available a million revolving credit facility  as well as a separate million short term borrowing facility  as described in note short term borrowings in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior years 
operating activities in generated cash flows of billion and the company s sale of its interest in the apollo travel services partnership provided million in cash proceeds see sale of affiliate 
cash was used primarily to fund net additions to property and equipment of billion and to repurchase common stock in the amount of million 
financing activities also included the early extinguishment of million in principal amount of various debt securities  mandatory repayments of long term debt totaling million and payments under capital leases of million 
in addition  the company made million in aircraft lease deposits with certain banks in connection with the financing of certain aircraft acquired under capital lease transactions and issued million of enhanced pass through certificates 
operating activities in generated cash flows of billion 
cash was used primarily to repay long term debt and to fund net additions to property and equipment 
in addition to the early extinguishment of million in principal amount of various debt securities  ual made mandatory repayments of long term debt totaling million and payments under capital lease obligations of million during the year 
financing activities also included payments of million for conversions of all of ual s outstanding convertible debentures  million for the reacquisition of ual s series b preferred stock and aircraft lease deposits of million with certain banks in connection with the financing of certain capital lease transactions 
net property additions amounted to billion 
capital commitments at december   commitments for the purchase of property and equipment  principally aircraft  approximated billion  after deducting advance payments 
of this amount  an estimated billion is due to be spent in for further details  see note commitments  contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources funds necessary to finance aircraft acquisitions are expected to be obtained from internally generated funds  external financing arrangements or other external sources 
at december   united s senior unsecured debt was rated bb by standard and poor s s p and baa by moody s investors service inc moody s 
ual s series b preferred stock and redeemable preferred securities were rated bb by s p and ba by moody s 
results of operations summary of results ual s earnings from operations were billion in  compared to operating earnings of billion in ual s net earnings in were million per share  diluted  compared to net earnings of million in per share  diluted 
the earnings include an extraordinary loss of million  after tax  on early extinguishment of debt and an after tax gain on the ats galileo transaction see sale of affiliate of million per share  diluted 
management believes that a more complete understanding of ual s results may be gained by viewing them on a pro forma  fully distributed basis 
this approach considers all esop shares which will ultimately be distributed to employees throughout the esop period rather than just the shares committed to be released to be immediately outstanding and thus fully distributed 
consistent with this method  the esop compensation expense is excluded from fully distributed net earnings  and esop convertible preferred stock dividends are not deducted from earnings attributable to common stockholders 
no adjustments are made to fully distributed earnings to reflect future salary increases 
a comparison of results reported on a fully distributed basis to results reported under generally accepted accounting principles gaap is as follows december  december  gaap fully gaap fully diluted distributed diluted distributed net income   per share earnings before gains on sales and extraordinary loss gains on sales of ats galileo  net extraordinary loss  net the current relationship of earnings and earnings per share as computed on a gaap basis versus a fully distributed basis may not be representative of the relationship in future periods because of various factors 
these factors include the dependence of esop compensation expense on the common stock price  trends and commitments with respect to wages  and the increasing number of shares assumed outstanding under the gaap basis during the remainder of the esop period 
compared with operating revenues 
operating revenues increased million while united s revenue per available seat mile unit revenue decreased to cents 
passenger revenues increased million due to a increase in united s revenue passenger miles despite a decrease in yield from to cents 
available seat miles across the system were up year over year  however  passenger load factor decreased point to 
the following analysis by market is based on information reported to the us department of transportation increase decrease available seat revenue passenger miles revenue per revenue miles capacity traffic passenger mile yield domestic pacific atlantic latin america pacific yields continue to be negatively impacted by the weakness of the japanese yen compared to the dollar during the first nine months of  and the continued effects of the asian economic turmoil on demand for travel 
yields in other international markets have been impacted by a negative pricing environment resulting from excess industry capacity and weakened economies 
cargo revenues increased million on increased freight ton miles of 
a relatively flat freight yield together with a lower mail yield  resulted in a decrease in cargo yield for the year 
other operating revenues decreased million due to the sale of ats in july  partially offset by increases in frequent flyer program partner related revenues and contract sales to third parties 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million and united s cost per available seat mile including esop compensation expense decreased  from cents to cents 
without the esop compensation expense  united s cost per available seat mile would have been cents  a decrease of from esop compensation expense decreased million reflecting the decrease in the estimated average fair value of stock committed to the supplemental esop 
purchased services increased million due to increases in computer reservations fees  credit card discounts  communications expense and year related spending 
depreciation and amortization increased million due to an increase in the number of owned aircraft and an million decrease in gains on asset sales  from million in to million in salaries and related costs increased million due to esop mid term wage adjustments which took place in july and increased staffing in certain customer oriented positions 
aircraft fuel decreased million as a result of a decrease in the average cost of fuel from cents to cents a gallon 
commissions decreased million due to a change in the commission structure implemented in the third quarter of as well as a slight decrease in commissionable revenues 
aircraft rent decreased million as a result of refinancing aircraft under operating lease 
other income and expense 
other income expense amounted to million in expense in compared to million in income in interest expense increased million in due to the issuance of long term debt in and interest income increased million due to higher investment balances 
in  foreign exchange losses increased million 
because not all economic hedges qualify as accounting hedges  unrealized gains and losses may be recognized in income in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows 
this mismatch of accounting gains and losses and foreign currency cash flows was especially pronounced during the fourth quarter of as a result of the appreciation in value of the japanese yen  relative to the us dollar 
this mismatch resulted in a pre tax charge of million which is included in foreign exchange losses 
in addition  included a million gain on the sale of ats and a million gain on the initial public offering of galileo stock 
compared with operating revenues 
operating revenues increased billion and united s revenue per available seat mile unit revenue increased to cents 
passenger revenues increased million due to a increase in united s revenue passenger miles and a increase in yield to cents 
available seat miles across the system were up year over year resulting in a slight increase to system passenger load factor of points to 
the following analysis by market is based on information reported to the us department of transportation dot increase decrease available seat revenue passenger miles revenue per revenue miles capacity traffic passenger mile yield domestic pacific atlantic latin america latin american yield was impacted by strengthening economies in latin american countries as well as an improved mix of high yield passengers 
strong us and european economies provided a positive pricing environment resulting in an increase in atlantic yield 
pacific yields reflect a weak japanese economy and a stronger us dollar 
domestic yield increased despite the fact that the us airline ticket tax was in effect for only four months of versus ten months of cargo revenues increased million on increases of in freight ton miles and in mail ton miles  as a result of a new dedicated freighter operation utilizing four dc s and the introduction of long range b b aircraft 
a lower freight yield was only partially offset by a higher mail yield for an overall decrease in cargo yield of 
other operating revenues increased million due to increases in frequent flyer program partner related revenues and fuel sales to third parties  partially offset by the loss of ats revenues resulting from its sale in july see sale of affiliate 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million and united s cost per available seat mile increased from to cents  including esop compensation expense 
without the esop compensation expense  united s cost per available seat mile would have been cents  an increase of less than from esop compensation expense increased million  reflecting the increase in the estimated average fair value of esop stock committed to be released to employees as a result of ual s higher common stock price 
salaries and related costs increased million as a result of increased staffing in certain customer contact positions  as well as mid term wage adjustments which took effect july  commissions increased million due to increased commissionable revenues  partially offset by the change in the commission structure which united implemented in the third quarter of united lowered the base commission paid to travel agents from to up to a maximum of on all tickets purchased in the us and canada for both domestic and international travel 
this action is expected to save approximately million annually in commission costs 
purchased services increased million due principally to volume related increases in computer reservations fees  credit card discounts and communication charges 
aircraft maintenance increased million due to increased purchased maintenance as well as the timing of maintenance cycles 
depreciation and amortization decreased million despite the acquisition of new aircraft  due to lower depreciation on dc aircraft which are scheduled for retirement  gains on asset sales of million in compared to million in  and a million charge in to reduce the carrying value of aircraft seats being replaced 
aircraft fuel decreased million despite a increase in consumption  due to a decrease in the price of fuel from cents to cents a gallon 
other income and expense 
other income expense amounted to million in income in compared to million in expense in interest capitalized  primarily on aircraft advance payments  increased million 
interest expense decreased million due to the prepayment of long term debt in interest income decreased million due to lower average interest rates 
in addition  included a million gain on the sale of ats and a million gain on the initial public offering of galileo stock 
included in is a million charge for the settlement of litigation related to the travel agency commission cap implemented by the company in february other information sale of affiliate in july  united completed the sale of its interest in the apollo travel services partnership ats  a owned affiliate whose accounts were consolidated  to galileo international  inc galileo  heretofore a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  for million in cash 
this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
of this amount  million was recognized during the third quarter of and the balance will be recognized over the next years  the estimated remaining life of the assets acquired by galileo 
galileo raised a portion of the proceeds used to purchase ats through the completion of an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock  representing of its economic interest  at per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
this transaction resulted in a reduction of the company s ownership in galileo from to 
in accordance with the company s policy of recognizing gains or losses on the sale of a subsidiary s stock based on the difference between the offering price and the company s carrying amount of such stock  the company recognized a pre tax gain of million during the third quarter of the company also recorded million of deferred taxes related to this gain 
united continues to account for galileo under the equity method and to purchase computer reservations services under its existing services agreement with galileo 
labor agreements and wage adjustments the recapitalization resulted in new labor agreements for certain employee groups and a new corporate governance structure  which was designed to achieve balance between the various employee owner groups and public stockholders 
the labor agreements and governance structure could inhibit management s ability to alter strategy in a volatile  competitive industry by restricting certain operating and financing activities  including the sale of assets  the issuance of equity securities and the ability to furlough employees 
consistent with the various agreements supporting the recapitalization  in  employees represented by the air line pilots association  international alpa and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam ratified agreements providing for restoration of wage rates for the two groups in the year to levels that existed prior to the recapitalization in july  as well as restoration of the company s contribution to the pilots defined contribution plan from its current rate of to its pre esop rate of in the year on october   the association of flight attendants afa ratified a new contract which will remain in effect through march  included in the contract were lump sum payments of in december and in  and  as well as minimum wage increases in  and additionally  the contract includes a series of arbitrations beginning in which can award additional compensation increases  subject to meeting vision goals as discussed below 
the agreement also provides for benefits and work rule changes and a number of service quality and productivity enhancements designed to help the company achieve its customer satisfaction objectives 
on july   the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam became the collective bargaining representative for united s approximately  public contact employees primarily customer service and reservations sales and service representatives 
in december  the company and the iam began negotiations regarding a contract for the affected employees 
also in july  united announced its intentions to improve compensation and benefits for the company s nearly  administrative employees hired on or after february  post esop employees 
currently  the company s administrative employees are being paid under a two tier wage structure which went into effect at the time of the recapitalization 
effective april   the two tiers will be merged and post esop employees will be paid on the same basis as those employees hired prior to february  in addition  on january   the benefits for full time post esop employees will match those of employees hired prior to february   including company paid medical  dental and pension  and the benefits for part time employees will be improved 
the wage  benefit and work rule adjustments outlined above are consistent with the company s objective  known as vision  to put employee compensation on a competitive level with peer group compensation at the conclusion of the agreements outlined above 
the ultimate cost to the company of vision  particularly given that peer group compensation is subject to change between now and the conclusion of the agreements  is not determinable 
however  as a result of these changes  the company expects that its annual salaries and related costs will increase at a faster rate than its major competitors from now through the year foreign operations united generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies 
these expenses include aircraft leases  commissions  catering  personnel costs  reservation and ticket office services  customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact operating income through changes in foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
despite the adverse favorable effects a strengthening weakening foreign currency may have on us originating traffic  a strengthening weakening of foreign currencies tends to increase decrease reported revenue and operating income because united s foreign currency denominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign currency denominated operating expense for each currency 
by carrying passengers and cargo in both directions between the us and almost every major economic region in the world and by selling its services in each local country  united attempts to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in any single foreign currency 
the company s biggest net exposures are typically for japanese yen  hong kong dollars  australian dollars and british pounds 
during  yen denominated operating revenue net of yen denominated operating expense was approximately billion yen approximately million  hong kong dollar denominated operating revenue net of hong kong dollar denominated operating expense was approximately  million hong kong dollars approximately million  australian dollar denominated operating revenue net of australian dollar denominated operating expense was approximately million australian dollars approximately million and british pound denominated operating revenue net of british pound denominated operating expense was approximately million british pounds approximately million 
united hedges some of the risk of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future yen revenues and hong kong revenues by purchasing put options for each respective currency 
to reduce some of the costs of this hedging program  the company also sells call options in each currency from time to time 
united continually monitors its foreign currency hedging program and is no longer entering into yen option contracts 
at a point in the future  united may elect to reestablish its yen hedging program 
united also attempts to reduce its exposure to transaction gains and losses by converting excess local currencies generated to us dollars and by entering into currency forward or exchange contracts 
the total notional amount of outstanding currency options and forward exchange contracts  and their respective fair market values as of december   are summarized in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk united s foreign operations involve insignificant amounts of physical assets  however  there are sizable intangible assets related to acquisitions of atlantic and latin american route authorities 
operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the united states and foreign countries 
changes in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact the value of united s international route authority 
significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on ual s operating revenues and results of operations 
airport rents and landing fees united is charged facility rental and landing fees at virtually every airport at which it operates 
in recent years  many airports have increased or sought to increase rates charged to airlines as a means of compensating for increasing demands upon airport revenues 
airlines have challenged certain of these increases through litigation and in some cases have not been successful 
the federal aviation administration faa and the dot have instituted an administrative hearing process to judge whether rate increases are legal and valid 
however  to the extent the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such charges is restricted  the rates charged by airports may increase substantially 
management cannot predict the magnitude of any such increase 
update on year readiness the company  like most corporations  faces potential problems if software applications  computer equipment and embedded computer chips fail to recognize calendar dates beginning in the year the company has developed a five step process to achieve year readiness awareness  inventory  assessment  remediation  and testing 
awareness consists of the initial recognition that a program  system  or device could be date sensitive and susceptible to malfunction 
inventory refers to the identification and documentation of all such programs  systems  and devices 
assessment refers to the evaluation and determination of what course of action should be taken with respect to a specific program  system or device 
remediation refers to the corrective action taken  such as repairing or replacing  to avoid malfunctions 
testing consists of all activities undertaken to gain assurance that the remediated program  system or device will function as expected for dates after the company has established a year program office to oversee this process 
the above referenced five step process is being applied in four major areas 
the first area consists of the information systems maintained and supported by the company s information services division  collectively referred to as information technology or it systems 
the it systems include  among other things  the hardware related infrastructure  which includes voice and data communications networks  and mainframe and non mainframe based software applications 
the company develops and uses these software applications in functions such as reservations  ticketing  flight scheduling  seat inventory and customer service 
the second area consists of user maintained applications that generally are not supported by the company s information services division 
the third area consists of operational systems and devices that include  among other things  aircraft avionics  baggage handling  aircraft ground handling  passenger loading bridges  and flight simulators 
user maintained applications and operational systems and devices are collectively referred to as non it systems 
the fourth area consists of the company s critical business partners which would include  among others  air traffic control systems  airport authorities  telecommunications providers  computer reservation systems  and airframe and engine manufacturers 
as discussed below  the company remains on target in completing its five step process 
the awareness and inventory phases are complete 
the assessment phase is complete with respect to it and non it systems  and substantial progress has been made in the remediation phase of the it systems  and with a few exceptions for non critical systems  substantially all it and non it systems will be remediated by march  the assessment process is still ongoing with respect to critical business partners 
it systems 
the company remains on schedule for completing the remediation of its hardware infrastructure 
remediation and the initial system testing of the mainframe hardware and software is substantially complete  while all other hardware infrastructure  including data and voice networks  is expected to be remediated and tested by march remediation and initial testing of essentially all internally developed it software applications has been completed as of december  system integration testing for all it systems that are critical to the operations is expected to be completed by june   and system integration testing for all other systems is expected to be completed by june  non it systems 
the technical assessment stage for non it systems is complete 
most airport systems including aircraft ground handling equipment  customer service equipment at airports and passenger loading bridges are not date sensitive and therefore will not require remediation 
those non it systems that are date sensitive and critical to the company s business  such as aircraft avionics and flight simulators  are scheduled to be substantially remediated and tested by june  critical business partners 
the company has grouped its critical business partners into three categories strategic  preferred or commodity 
the strategic category consists of those partners  such as air traffic control systems  airport authorities  telecommunications providers  computer reservation systems  and airframe and engine manufacturers  without which the company would cease to operate 
the preferred category consists of partners that have substantial interaction with the company  but whose absence would not necessarily cause an immediate or irreversible interruption or cessation of business operations 
the commodity category consists of those partners who provide goods or services that could be readily replaced and whose absence would not materially impact the business 
the company has been contacting its strategic partners and performing site visits to ascertain their state of year readiness  and has contacted all of them as of december  preferred and commodity partners are being contacted to evaluate their year remediation programs 
to date the company has contacted a significant number of preferred and commodity partners 
for those partners without programs in place or not responding  the company may look for alternate suppliers unless a year program is in place with a planned completion date no later than june  the company is working closely with the air transport association ata  an industry organization consisting mostly of north american airlines 
the ata has undertaken a study to assess the process that major domestic airports are using to achieve year readiness 
preliminary results of that study suggest most of the larger domestic airports are making progress toward being year compliant 
certain of the smaller domestic airports do not  as yet  have detailed year plans in place 
a similar project is underway with the international air transport association to review the year process at international airports 
current information suggests that some key international airports may be behind schedule 
the company s aircraft manufacturers have concluded that there are no flight safety issues 
however  the company continues to test its aircraft systems and to work with its manufacturers to ensure year readiness 
to date  the company has projected that it will cost approximately million million in capital spending and million in expense to make the company year ready 
of that total  million has already been spent  while the remaining million is expected to be spent in all the amounts expected to be recognized as expense in have been taken into consideration in the earnings outlook discussed in the outlook for 
a series of airline readiness reviews are planned during the second quarter of to ensure aircraft  air traffic control  airports  support groups and critical business partners are prepared for year and can provide uninterrupted operations 
by september   the company will complete a risk analysis and develop risk estimates after completing the airline readiness reviews 
based on the results of the airline readiness review  the company will develop any contingency plans that are needed 
at this point in time  the company does not have specific year contingency plans in place 
it is likely that certain international airports and air traffic control systems will not complete their year programs by september  we will continue to evaluate year readiness at these locations and develop contingency plans as needed 
the company believes that the current and planned activities to modify its systems will reduce the risks of a business interruption 
a failure by its systems to be year ready could materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company also relies heavily upon its critical business partners in its normal business activities 
failure by critical business partners to be year ready could materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty surrounding the year problem  and the uncertainty surrounding the readiness of its critical business partners  the company is unable at this time to determine if any failure will occur or if such failure will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
readers are cautioned that the year section contains forward looking information 
please see the outlook for for a list of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results 
environmental and legal contingencies united has been named as a potentially responsible party at certain environmental protection agency epa cleanup sites which have been designated as superfund sites 
united s alleged proportionate contributions at the sites are minimal  however  at sites where the epa has commenced litigation  potential liability is joint and several 
additionally  united has participated and is participating in remediation actions at certain other sites  primarily airports 
the estimated cost of these actions is accrued when it is determined that it is probable that united is liable 
environmental regulations and remediation processes are subject to future change  and determining the actual cost of remediation will require further investigation and remediation experience 
therefore  the ultimate cost cannot be determined at this time 
however  while such cost may vary from united s current estimate  united believes the difference between its accrued reserve and the ultimate liability will not be material 
ual has certain other contingencies resulting from this and other litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business 
management believes  after considering a number of factors  including but not limited to the views of legal counsel  the nature of such contingencies and prior experience  that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially affect ual s financial condition  operating results or liquidity 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet quantified the impacts of adopting sfas no 
on the financial statements 
however  it could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
outlook for the company anticipates continued strong performance in largely based on expected strong us economic activity 
in addition  there are early indications of some modest improvement in united s pacific revenue and profit performance 
these factors are expected to outweigh the anticipated negative impact on atlantic unit revenues and profits associated with industry capacity growth in the region 
the company expects its system capacity to grow  which is less than the forecasted industry capacity growth rate 
unit revenues are estimated to range between higher and lower than unit costs excluding esop charge are estimated to be about higher than  based on an average fuel price of approximately cents per gallon including taxes 
among the factors affecting costs will be the cap in international commissions instituted last year and the level of spending on year see update on year readiness 
in summary  the company forecasts earnings to range between and per fully distributed share  with its internal goal being to earn per fully distributed share 
the company s earnings per share performance will be helped by the reduction in share count stemming from the million common stock repurchase program completed earlier this year 
for the first quarter of  the company expects system capacity growth of approximately  with domestic capacity growing by around 
unit costs excluding esop charge are estimated to be higher and unit revenues are expected to be lower than the same quarter this revenue assumption is based on a continuation of recent results and current data trends that indicate a reversal of the domestic revenue weakness that began in the fourth quarter of last year and lingered into the early part of the first quarter this year 
this reversal could be attributable to the dissipation of economic uncertainty and an improvement in the pricing environment following the expiration of fares sold in the aftermath of northwest airlines pilot strike 
separately  the company also benefited this quarter from the recent labor unrest at american airlines 
based on these assumptions  the company s expectations for first quarter earnings fall in a range around per fully distributed share  the highest first call estimate as of march  the information included in the above outlook section  as well as certain statements made throughout the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are identified by an asterisk is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
it is not reasonably possible to itemize all of the many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook of an airline operating in the global economy 
some factors that could significantly impact expected capacity  unit revenues  revenues  fully distributed unit costs  profits  fuel prices and fully distributed earnings per share include the success of the company s cost control efforts  the outcome of negotiations on new contracts with the union groups  industry capacity decisions  the airline pricing environment  the economic environment of the airline industry  fuel prices  actions of the us  foreign and local governments  the asian economic environment and travel patterns  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and the general economic environment 
with respect to the forward looking statements set forth in the environmental and legal contingencies section  some of the factors that could affect the ultimate disposition of these contingencies are changes in applicable laws  the development of facts in individual cases  settlement opportunities and the actions of plaintiffs  judges and juries 
some factors that could significantly impact the company s expected year readiness and the estimated cost thereof include the results of the technical assessment  remediation and testing of date sensitive systems and equipment and the ability of critical business partners  including domestic and international airport authorities  aircraft manufacturers and the federal aviation administration  to achieve year readiness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk united s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations and short term investments 
united does not use derivative financial instruments in its investments portfolio 
united s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements  depending upon market conditions 
a portion of the borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies which exposes the company to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the company has placed foreign currency deposits primarily for japanese yen  french francs and german marks to meet foreign currency lease obligations designated in the respective currencies 
the company is not exposed to foreign currency risk on these deposits since unrealized mark to market gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations 
the fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate 
the fair value of long term debt is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows using a us treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument  adjusted by a credit spread

the goal of the hedging program is to effectively manage risk associated with fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency  thereby making financial results more stable and predictable 
united does not use currency forwards or currency options for trading purposes 
united is no longer entering into yen option contracts 
at a point in the future  united may elect to reestablish its yen hedging program 
in millions  except average contract rates notional average estimated amount contract rate fair value forward exchange contracts japanese yen purchased forwards sold forwards hong kong dollar sold forwards french franc purchased forwards currency options japanese yen put options call options as of december   united had million of japanese yen forwards outstanding with a fair value of million  million yen put options with a fair value of and million yen call options with a fair value of million 
price risk aircraft fuel at december   the company had contracted to purchase approximately of the company s fuel requirements at an average fixed price of per gallon 
when market conditions indicate risk reduction is achievable  united enters into fuel option contracts to reduce its price risk exposure to jet fuel 
based on projected market conditions  united does not believe risk reduction is presently achievable and is no longer entering into new option contracts 
as market conditions change  so may united s hedging program 
the option contracts  which involve either purchasing call options and simultaneously selling put options collar strategy or purchasing call options  are designed to provide protection against sharp increases in the price of aircraft fuel
