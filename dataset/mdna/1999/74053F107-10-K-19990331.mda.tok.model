item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is to be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  presented elsewhere in this report under item financial condition the following table compares the changes in major categories of the company s balance sheet from december  to december  dollars in thousands change vs

such declines were principally in net loans of and million in securities  while cash and cash equivalents increased million 
of the decrease in loans  residential mortgages  principally arm s  and construction loans held by the bank decreased million or and consumer and other primarily indirect automobile financing decreased million or 
although the balances of residential mortgages held by the bank declined  new originations of such loans totaled approximately million of which approximately million were sold into the secondary market reflecting the company s interest rate risk management policy 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in commercial mortgage loans which increased by million or and commercial and industrial loans which increased million or 
while average investments and taxable securities were up about million  or  at year end  a decrease of million was due mainly to the sale of mortgage backed securities of million in december as part of a restructuring of the portfolio after the merger 
however  municipal holdings increased by million or 
this shift was made principally by investing in bank qualified bonds within new york state  where the tax equivalent yields are significantly higher and market price volatility value risks lower than other securities of comparable maturity 
corporate securities also increased by million or as a result of the company redeploying the proceeds of securities sales into a state tax advantaged subsidiary 
deposits decreased by million principally reflecting the company s interest rate policies in light of its high liquidity and low loan demand 
while noninterest bearing deposits increased by million  interest bearing deposits declined by million 
of the decrease in interest bearing deposits  million of growth in money market deposit accounts primarily premier products was offset by declines in savings accounts of million  now of million  and certificate of deposit accounts of million 
for additional information regarding deposits  see item business deposits 
additionally  net investments in premises and equipment increased by million due to costs associated with branch automation and new branches in wappingers  newburgh  middletown  mt 
kisco and somers 
of the seven offices consolidated in  five were leased and two were owned facilities 
although on the market  the owned facilities have not been sold as of december  other assets decreased million  primarily due to lower levels of interest income receivable 
the allowance for loan losses grew by million to million or a increase  as provisions for loan losses of million exceeded net charge offs of million 
in june  in connection with conforming its accounting policies with regard to the allowance  the company made an additional provision for loan losses of million 
the allowance for loan losses represented of total loans for compared to in further  the allowance for loan losses was of nonperforming loans at december  compared to at december   as nonperforming loans increased slightly from million at year end to million at year end stockholders equity grew million or in compared to year end of this increase  million arose from net income and million from the sale of additional shares of stock through the company s dividend reinvestment and employee stock option plans and 
million from the net change in the unrealized gains on securities available for sale  after tax 
these sources were offset by dividends declared of million and treasury stock repurchases  in connection with the exercise of employee stock options  of 
million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers who need to draw funds under their available credit facilities 
as detailed in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows included in the financial statements  cash flows are derived from three sources cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in investing activities primarily purchases and sales of securities and the funding of loans generated million in as purchases of securities of million did not exceed sales  maturities  and prepayment of loans and securities of million 
financing activities used million represented by million decrease in deposits  dividends of million and stock repurchases and redemptions of 
million  offset by the proceeds of new common stock issuances of million 
the overall result was that cash and cash equivalents increased million at december  the company s liquidity ratio defined as cash and cash equivalents plus securities available for sale million to total assets was at year end the average life of the available for sale portfolio  on a rate sensitivity basis  is slightly over three years 
these liquid assets  together with maturing loans  are deemed by management to be more than adequate to meet expected liquidity needs 
in addition  the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank and has the ability to borrow substantial funds million under its secured advance program 
the holding company s own liquidity needs are chiefly for paying dividends 
the principal sources of income for the company are investment income  dividends and rents received from the bank 
dividends from the bank are subject to certain regulatory limitations at year end 
the company had ample cash and liquid investments at the holding company level 
million 
to meet its reasonably anticipated cash needs in financial institutions assets are monetary in nature and are thus impacted by inflation  interest rate and credit considerations 
this results in the need to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
in addition  the company and the bank are subject to regulatory requirements to maintain minimum capital levels 
these capital requirements and the actual levels maintained by the bank and the company are summarized in note o to the consolidated financial statements  included herein under item the capital levels of both the bank and the company exceed all regulatory requirements and regulatory agencies have informed management that  as of december   the bank qualifies for well capitalized status under the appropriate regulatory definitions 
further  the company believes that the capital levels maintained are more than adequate to meet its currently foreseeable needs and that additional capital resources would be required only for exceptional investment opportunities 
pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  the bank s regulator developed risk based capital standards that take account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk  the risk of nontraditional activities and the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi family mortgages 
such standards may have the effect of increasing the level of regulatory capital that the company and bank are required to maintain 
the company s risk based capital ratio as of december  was 
in february  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program and authorized management to purchase up to  shares approximately of the company s common stock from the market 
at the current market prices  the total repurchase program would utilize approximately million offset by dividend reinvestment plan issuances estimated to total approximately million and an unknown amount of employee stock option exercises over the next two years 
the purpose of the repurchase program is to offset the effects of new stock issuances under the company s dividend reinvestment and stock option plans and for other general corporate purposes 
the company has sufficient cash and securities to effect this repurchase program over the next two years 
impact of year issue the company s state of readiness information technology the company relies heavily on complex internal and third party computer systems for all phases of its operations  including document and electronic transaction processing  interest calculation  financial record keeping and customer service 
the company has outsourced services and software for substantially all of its mission critical systems  and has been working with these third party providers since mid to address year concerns 
at december   mission critical applications had been certified by the providers as year compliant 
the company s internal testing of these mission critical systems  originally scheduled for completion by december   was completed by february  based on its initial review of the test results  the company believes that its mission critical systems are now year compliant 
a bank wide evaluation of non mission critical software and hardware was completed february  this evaluation was conducted in conjunction with an upgrade of branch automation software planned for and replacement of non compliant non mission critical hardware and software is targeted for completion by june   and will be largely accomplished as the company completes the roll out of the planned branch automation hardware and software 
non information technology the company s exposure to non information technology systems is not material  in that its fixtures such as vaults  elevators and environmental control systems are not generally equipped with date sensitive microchips 
third parties during  the company implemented a process for evaluating the credit risk associated with its major customers 
the year risk associated with each credit is based in part on responses to a year questionnaire  in part on evaluations completed by account officers and in part on other considerations  such as the type of industry and reliance on automated systems 
the company disclaims any liability or obligation for the completeness  or lack thereof  of its customers year remediation plans 
to the extent that this process discloses borrowers or classes of borrowers with significant year risk  the company plans to allocate appropriate reserves for possible yk related credit losses 
at december   the company has not allocated any significant reserves for such potential losses 
the company is also working with its key vendors and suppliers and its correspondent banks and brokers to assure no interruption in the business relationship between the company and these important third party providers 
these key providers include  but are not limited to  payroll service providers  secondary market software providers  telephone and utility companies and fiduciary record keeping processors 
the company plans to complete additional testing in cooperation with the more critical contract providers 
at december   the company is not aware of the potential failure of any of these suppliers  but will continue to monitor and evaluate their year readiness 
the company is critically dependent on certain unrelated non contractual third parties for the conduct of its business  such as the federal reserve payment system  the automated clearinghouse system  and telecommunications and local energy providers 
the company exercises no influence over these providers  and there are few  if any  alternatives for obtaining these services 
at december  the company had successfully completed testing its wire transfer system with the federal reserve bank  and had also successfully completed its testing with the automated clearinghouse system 
the costs to address the company s year issues management does not consider the amounts expended to date to be material  and the projected costs to be incurred over the next months are not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
these projected costs include upgrading a number of the company s atms  replacing non compliant network software and testing costs incurred in connection with certain phases of the company s test plan  which will include proxy testing and scheduling test time with the bank s primary service bureau  and will include the costs of consultants engaged to evaluate the results of the company s year testing program 
at december   the company has incurred approximately  of the originally estimated  in anticipated year costs 
these anticipated costs included renovation of custom code by a third party provider  proxy testing  the cost of consultants  and the renovation of certain atms and vaults 
although this original estimate seems to remain appropriate  no assurance can be given that challenges will not be uncovered in the future which will require additional expense to address 
although the company does not specifically monitor the cost of internal resources diverted to the year project  these costs have consumed  and can be expected to continue to consume  a substantial portion of these internal resources  notably information technology department resources 
management will fund these year costs  which represent current best estimates  from normal cash flow 
the risks of the company s year issues at december   the company views an extended disruption in service to its customers as the most likely worst case scenario 
if the company s mission critical systems are not compliant  it may not be able to correctly process transactions in a reasonable period of time 
this scenario could result in a wide variety of claims for improper handling of its assets as well as liabilities and other borrowings from its customers 
at december   management deems the probability of this scenario to be low  but the impact of any such disruption on the company could be anticipated to be material  and to raise serious concerns about the ability of the company to continue 
a more likely scenario is one in which the company experiences temporary disruptions in service of one or more of the unrelated vendors on which the company or its data processing company is critically dependent is not year compliant 
these unrelated vendors include providers of telecommunication services and other utilities 
the company would manage this risk by relying  temporarily  on manual record keeping  as well as by closing or limiting hours of operations at selected offices  and by utilizing staff and equipment at locations not affected by the loss of service 
the company s contingency plans the company anticipates completing its initial mission critical year contingency plans by march  the deferral from the original target date of january  is the result of the rescheduling of mission critical testing to february asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and capital resources 
the company s investment committee of the board monitors  and the bank  through its treasury division  controls the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet while maintaining an appropriate level of net interest income contribution to the operations of the company 
the company s net interest revenue is affected by fluctuations in market interest rates as a result of timing differences in the repricing of its assets and liabilities 
these repricing differences are quantified in specific time intervals and are referred to as interest rate sensitivity gaps 
the company manages the interest rate risk of current and future earnings to a level that is consistent with its mix of businesses and seeks to limit such risk exposure to appropriate percentages of both earnings and the imputed value of stockholders equity 
the objective in managing interest rate risk is to support the achievement of business strategies  while controlling earnings variability and ensuring appropriate liquidity 
further  the historical level of demand deposits approximately of total assets serves to mitigate the effects of increases in interest rates and reduces the average cost of total liabilities 
the following chart in thousands provides a quantification of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap as of december   based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets at amortized cost and liabilities and the assumed repricing dates of others 
as shown in the chart below  at december   assuming no management action  the company s principal interest rate risk is to a rising rate environment and particularly within one year time frame 
that is  net interest revenue would be expected to be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates above the rates embedded in the current yield curve  principally due to the higher level of liabilities  that would reprice relative to similarly situated assets in that time frame 
this exposure would be mitigated over the longer term as the company has million more in repriceable interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities beyond one year 
this chart displays only a static view of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap and does not capture the dynamics of rate and spread movements nor management s actions that may be taken to manage this risk 
three months four months to total within one year to five greater than maturity repricing date or less one year one year years five years total securities       fed funds    fixed rate loans     floating rate loans       total interest earning assets       other interest bearing deposits      time and other       fhlb advance    total interest bearing liabilities       interest sensitivity gap       gap as a percent of earning assets notes to chart interest rate sensitivity gaps are defined as the fixed rate positions assets less liabilities for a given time period 
the gaps measure the time weighted dollar equivalent volume of positions fixed for a particular period 
the gap positions reflect a repricing date at which date funds are assumed to mature and reprice to a current market rate for the asset or liability 
the table does not include loans on nonaccrual status or net unrealized gains recorded on available for sale securities as of december  variable rate balances are reported based on their repricing formulas 
fixed rate balances are reported based on their scheduled contractual maturity dates  except for certain investment securities and loans secured by family residential properties that are based on anticipated cash flows 
savings accounts one half of the level of merit savings accounts  which reprice against changes in the federal reserve discount rate  are classified as three months or less maturities 
managements analysis of changes in levels indicate that changes in this rate are approximately half as often as changes in other market rates 
the balance of these accounts and other savings accounts are classified as four months to one year maturities  reflecting the lagging period that historically exists in rates paid on passbook and savings accounts 
other deposits time deposits are classified by contractual maturity or repricing frequency 
now accounts are classified as four months to one year maturities 
the balance of deposits are considered less than three months  including all money market deposit accounts 
the interest rate sensitivity assumptions presented for these deposits are based on historical and current experiences regarding balance retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
non interest bearing deposit liabilities were approximately million at december  interest rate risk management of interest rate risk focuses on both tactical one year or less and structural beyond one year time frames 
the company has established interest rate risk limits based on an earnings at risk ear concept and on an imputed market value of portfolio equity mvpe 
ear measures the potential adverse impact on earnings from a given change in the yield curve  while the market value of portfolio equity risk limit is set in terms of changes in the economic present value of future cash flow streams 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses simulation analysis to determine the impact on ear and mvpe under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
model parameters are determined based on past interest rate movements and are periodically updated 
ear is calculated by multiplying the gap between asset and liability maturities repricings by given changes in the yield curve 
mvpe is calculated by subtracting the net present value of deposits and other interest bearing liabilities from the net present value of interest earning assets using the same yield curve model 
both mvpe and ear are measured assuming a parallel change in market interest rates up basis points and down basis points over a one year shock 
while the company principally utilizes the parallel rate shift model for monitoring its compliance with its interest rate risk limits  it also periodically reviews and assesses its rate risk exposure to non parallel yield curve changes including inversion 
compliance with established limits is monitored by the investment committee and the company s interest rate risk profile is presented quarterly to the board of directors 
both mvpe and ear assess the company s interest rate risk based on the company s current asset and liability mix 
such limit for mvpe changes is a maximum change in the excess of the company s current mvpe over the company s gaap equity value 
at year end  this limit was million 
for ear  the limit is not greater than a million pre tax change in ear 
the following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in the company s net interest income and market value of portfolio equity market value of assets  less liabilities 
the interest rate scenarios presented in the table are based on interest rates at december  adjusted by instantaneous parallel rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points 
each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on the company 
the net interest income variability reflects the company s negative interest rate sensitivity gap 
the mvpe is significantly impacted by the estimated effect of prepayments on the value of loans  and amortizing investment securities 
further  this analysis is based on the company s present profile of assets  liabilities and equity and does not reflect any actions the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
this action could minimize the change in mvpe in the various rate scenarios in thousands 
change in change in net interest change in market value of interest rates income ear portfolio equity mvpe change mvpe mortgage backed and sba securities of us government agencies the company currently invests in mortgage backed securities fhlmc  fnma  and gnma and sba pooled loans in connection with its asset liability management strategy 
as of december   the company had million in fixed rate securities and million in adjustable rate securities of this nature 
these securities are all guaranteed by us government agencies and are  therefore  of the highest investment grade 
these securities are subject to varying monthly payments due to varying prepayments by the borrowers on the underlying loans 
as a general rule  when interest rates rise  prepayments slow down  extending the anticipated maturities of the fixed rate securities 
conversely  when interest rates decline  prepayments rise  as many of the borrowers refinance their loans at lower rate levels 
the company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of prepayments in securities or other earning assets with comparable yields  which can adversely affect net interest income 
prepayment levels affect the contractual repayment profile of the securities 
these uncertainties cause more volatile market value shifts than do serial or single payment bonds  particularly as interest rates rise 
the company manages this portion of its investment portfolio by only investing in such fixed rate securities with expected average lives of years but not greater than years  or in adjustable rate securities which evidence lower price volatility due to their adjustable rate feature

asset quality and provisions for loan losses the following table presents details of the company s nonperforming assets and restructured loans 
the accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when a loan becomes days past due as to interest or principal or  with respect to current loans  if management has doubts about the ability of the borrower to regularly pay interest and or principal on a timely basis 
when interest accruals are discontinued  any interest income credited to the current year which has not been collected is reversed  and any interest accrued in the prior year is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the loan is in the process of collection and the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to cover the principal and accrued interest 
if payments on nonaccrual loans are made  income is recorded when received unless management has reason to doubt the ultimate collectibility of the principal remaining on the loan in which all payments are applied to principal 
loans are returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectibility has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions 
the table below summarizes the company s non performing assets and restructured loans for the years indicated in thousands at december  nonaccrual loans      accruing loans past due days or more restructured loans and troubled debt   total non performing loans      amount collateralized by real estate      other real estate owned     total non performing assets      nonaccrual status denotes loans on which  in the opinion of management  the collection of interest or principal is unlikely  or loans that meet other nonaccrual criteria as established by regulatory authorities 
payments received on loans classified as nonaccrual are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan 
includes loans and mortgages secured by residential real estate of    and at december      and  respectively 
non performing loans increased by 
million to million at december  as the result of several residential mortgage loans being placed on nonaccrual status partially offset by declines in restructured loans 
other real estate owned declined 
million due to disposal of such properties 
of the amount of non performing loans outstanding at december   million is collateralized by real estate approximately 
at december   the company had million in non performing loans of which million was collateralized by real estate compared to december  non performing loans total million being collateralized by real estate

allowance for loan losses as a percent of year end loans allowance as a percent of non performing loans an adjustment of was transferred to the allowance for the loan losses as a result of the acquisition of assets and liabilities of the first national bank of armenia 
the provision for loan losses  which is charged to operations  is based on both the amount of net loan losses incurred and management s ongoing evaluation of the level and composition of risk in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation considers  in addition to the results of a continuous program of individual loan assessment  factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions and expected impact of year on its borrowers and recent trends  loan portfolio composition  the level of nonperforming assets  prior loan loss experience and trends  growth of the portfolio and management s statistical estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio 
the company has not been involved in any foreign loans or highly leveraged transactions  which are generally considered high risk loans 
the provision for loan losses increased by million or in compared to a decrease of 
million or in this increase was substantially attributable to a special provision of million taken in june of to conform the provisioning policy of the constituent banks

this ratio also does not reflect collateral values  although the large majority of the bank s nonperforming assets are collateralized by real estate 
net charge offs of loans were million in as compared to million in and million in management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover credit risk inherent in the portfolio but no assurance can be given that the current apparent stabilization of the local economy will not be unsettled by future events 
such developments could be expected to adversely affect the financial performance of the company
