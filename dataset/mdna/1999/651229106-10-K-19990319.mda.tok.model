the company believes that the principal factors affecting its ability to achieve these objectives in the future are likely to be the realized rates of both acquisition and internal growth and the company s continued ability to integrate acquired businesses through a process called newellization 
since  the company has more than tripled its sales by acquiring businesses with aggregate annual sales of approximately billion excluding rubbermaid

legal and environmental matters the company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims  including various environmental matters  that have arisen in the ordinary conduct of its business 
such matters are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect any amount it may be required to pay in excess of amounts reserved will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
year computer compliance state of readiness any computer equipment that uses two digits instead of four to specify the year will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year this year issue could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
in order to address year compliance issues  the company has initiated a comprehensive project designed to minimize or eliminate these kinds of operational disruptions in its information technology it systems  as well as its non it systems eg  hvac systems and building security systems 
the project consists of six phases company recognition  inventory of systems  impact analysis  planning  fixing and testing 
the company has substantially completed all phases for its it and non it systems in the united states 
with respect to international it systems  approximately of the company s critical business systems are currently compliant and approximately are in the process of being fixed and tested 
with respect to international non it systems  the assessment phase indicated a need for only minor fixing 
for both international it and non it systems  the fixing and testing phases currently underway are generally expected to be completed by june as part of its year project  the company has initiated communications with all of its key vendors and services suppliers including raw material and utility providers to assess their state of year readiness 
over of its key vendors and service suppliers have responded in writing to the company s year readiness inquiries and have said they will be year compliant 
the company plans to continue assessment of its third party business partners  including face to face meetings with management and or onsite visits as deemed appropriate 
the company is prepared in cases where its main vendor or service provider cannot continue with its business due to year problems to use alternate vendors as sources for required materials 
despite the company s efforts  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies which the company relies upon to conduct its day to day business will be compliant 
costs the company estimates that it will incur total expenses of million to million in conjunction with the year compliance project excluding such expenses relating to the rubbermaid operations 
as of december   the company has spent million in conjunction with this project 
the majority of these expenditures were capitalized since they were associated with purchased software that would have been replaced in the normal course of business 
risks with respect to the risks associated with its it and non it systems  the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario is that the company may experience minor system malfunctions and errors in the early days and weeks of that were not detected during its fixing and testing efforts 
the company also believes that these problems will not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
with respect to the risks associated with third parties  the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario is that some of the company s vendors will not be compliant and will have difficulty filling orders and delivering goods 
management also believes that the number of such vendors will have been minimized by the company s program of identifying non compliant vendors and replacing or jointly developing alternative supply or delivery solutions prior to due to the diversity of its product lines  the company does not have material sensitivity to any one vendor or service supplier 
the company has limited the scope of its risk assessment to those factors upon which it can reasonably be expected to have an influence 
for example  the company has made the assumption that government agencies  utility companies and telecommunications providers will continue to operate 
obviously  the lack of such services could have a material effect on the company s ability to operate  but the company has little if any ability to influence such an outcome  or to reasonably make alternative arrangements in advance for such services in the event they are unavailable 
contingency plans in the united states  the company has all of its major business systems running on a centralized system for all of its operating divisions 
although extensive testing has been completed for these systems  the following contingency plan has been adopted for year issues that may occur on january  and thereafter a triage team has been assembled which has the authority and financial capabilities to rectify all systems problems that may occur 
the team consists of corporate officers and managers from every support function 
the team has access to vendor support hotlines and internal staffs 
once a problem has been identified and course of action determined  staff will be assigned to provide around the clock corrective actions until the problem is resolved 
international operations the company s non us business is growing at a faster pace than its business in the united states 
this growth outside the us has been fueled by recent international acquisitions  which supplemented the company s existing canadian businesses and newell international  the company s subsidiary responsible for the majority of exports of the company s products 
for the year ended december   the company s non us business accounted for approximately of sales and of operating income see note to the consolidated financial statements 
growth of both the us and the us businesses is shown below year ended december  change in millions net sales us   non us total   operating income us non us total year ended december  change in millions net sales us   non us total   operating income us non us total restated for the merger with calphalon corporation  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
market risk the company s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and certain commodity prices 
pursuant to the company s policies  natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company s primary market risk is interest rate exposure  primarily in the united states 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate exposure was reduced significantly in from the issuance of million company obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust  the proceeds of which reduced commercial paper 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions  and  for qualifying hedges  the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less 
the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows  structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk  converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 
in addition  the company utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
derivatives used to hedge intercompany transactions are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the consolidated statements of income 
due to the diversity of its product lines  the company does not have material sensitivity to any one commodity 
the company manages commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of its vendor contracts 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model 
the value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equity method investments 
the fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of operations or financial condition as they represent economic not financial losses 
time confidence amount period level in millions interest rates day foreign exchange day the confidence interval signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company s favor 
the value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets 
euro currency conversion on january   the euro became the common legal currency for of the member countries of the european union 
on that date  the participating countries fixed conversion rates between their exiting sovereign currencies legacy currencies and the euro 
on january   the euro began trading on currency exchanges and became available for non cash transactions  if the parties elect to use it 
the legacy currencies will remain legal tender through december  beginning january   participating countries will introduce euro denominated bills and coins  and effective july   legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender 
after the dual currency phase  all businesses in participating countries must conduct all transactions in the euro and must convert their financial records and reports to be euro based 
the company has commenced an internal analysis of the euro conversion process to prepare its information technology systems for the conversion and analyze related risks and issues  such as the benefit of the decreased exchange rate risk in cross border transactions involving participating countries and the impact of increased price transparency on cross border competition in these countries 
the company believes that the euro conversion process will not have a material impact on the company s businesses or financial condition on a consolidated basis
