however  actual results will be determined by the ability to attract buyers or use materials in the normal course of business 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  in fiscal and represent of net sales as compared to in the prior year

general factors because of the project oriented nature of the company s business  the company s largest customers have historically tended to vary from year to year depending on the number and size of the projects completed for these customers 
during fiscal  sales to america online  inc aol were of the company s total net sales 
sales to aol in fiscal were of total net sales from continuing operations and in fiscal were of total net sales from continuing operations 
also  during fiscal  sales to kimberly clark corporation kc were of the company s total net sales from continuing operations for the period  sales to kc were and of the company s total net sales from continuing operations in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  sales to kraft foods  inc and affiliates kraft accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales from continuing operations for the period  sales to kraft were and of the company s total net sales from continuing operations in fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease in sales to kraft is attributable to a decrease in promotion and premium activity on the part of kraft  in addition  the company sold much of its fulfillment business during fiscal and had no fulfillment sales to kraft during fiscal sales to kraft represent sales to several kraft divisions and subsidiaries 
the company performs various services on behalf of these clients  such as  printing  production of labels and contract packaging 
changes in the company s project mix and timing of projects make predictability of the company s future results very difficult 
in particular  sales to aol depend upon the timing of aol marketing initiatives which can change frequently and vary significantly from period to period 
additional changes in the company s project mix and customer base could affect future sales volume and profitability 
the company expects that it will continue to experience significant sales concentration given the relatively large size of projects undertaken for certain customers 
furthermore  the company s largest customers may vary from year to year depending on the number and size of the projects completed for such customers 
the loss of business of one or more principal customers or a change in the number or character of projects for particular customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 
customers generally purchase the company s services under cancelable purchase orders rather than long term contracts  although exceptions sometimes occur when the company is required to purchase substantial inventories or special machinery to meet orders 
the company believes that operating without long term contracts is consistent with industry practices  although it increases the company s vulnerability to losses of business and significant period to period changes 
the company uses complex and specialized equipment to provide its services  and manufacture its products 
therefore  the company is dependent upon the functioning of such machinery  and its ability to acquire and maintain appropriate equipment 
liquidity and capital resources as shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows  fiscal cash provided from operating activities was million as compared to million in fiscal the company s cash position was reduced by million used for acquiring property plant and equipment  purchasing businesses  and giving a loan to an officer for the purchase of stock 
in addition  the company used cash to pay down an additional million of long term debt 
in addition to cash generated as a result of improved operations  the company s operating cash benefited by a million reduction in accounts and notes receivable  a  reduction in inventory  and a  reduction in other assets 
the company s operating cash was reduced by a million reduction of accounts payable and a  reduction in accrued liabilities 
with respect to the reduction of accounts payable  approximately million related to receivables collected by the company on behalf of the buyer of outlook foods and other post closing purchase price adjustments in fiscal during fiscal the company provided million for additional reserves and write downs of receivables and inventory as compared to million in fiscal the company continues to monitor its inventory requirements and the credit worthiness of its customers 
management continues its program to reduce inventory to desired levels 
at may   of the company s accounts receivable balance relates to one customer  aol 
as of august  substantially all of this balance had been paid 
cash from investing activities represents expenditures for additional property  plant and equipment and the purchase of business from precision sheeting and kostner graphics 
net cash used in financing activities was million  of which approximately million represents the company s net reduction of debt 
the balance represents an increase in a book balance cash overdraft 
the company was able to reduce its debt as a result of cash available from improved management of operations and working capital 
the company holds notes receivable from the purchasers of its barrier operations that total approximately million 
the company is currently in litigation to collect those amounts  and the other party is making claims against the company  including the termination of the note 
see item litigation 
the company is also in the process of litigation to collect another note that totals approximately million 
a failure of the company to collect these amounts  or amounts due under other notes or accounts receivable  in excess of reserves  would adversely affect the company s balance sheet and results of operations 
the company maintains a credit facility with a bank  but has no outstanding balances on the revolver 
the facility provides for a maximum revolving credit commitment of million less million used for standby letters of credit 
interest on the debt outstanding during the year varied with the company s selection to have the debt be based upon margins over the bank determined preference or a libor rate 
the company s actual rate is dependent upon the company s performance against a specific ratio as measured against a predetermined performance chart 
as a result of its improved cash position  the company renegotiated its line of credit facility in may  and obtained less costly loan fees and other improved terms and conditions 
the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  excluding any acquisition opportunities which may become available to the company 
the company intends to finance these expenditures through funds obtained from operations plus its credit facilities and possible leasing opportunities 
in july  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
no timeframe was set for completion of this program 
as of august  the company had repurchased  shares for approximately  the company regularly reassesses how its various operations complement the company as a whole and considers strategic decisions to acquire new operations or expand  terminate or sell certain existing operations 
these reviews resulted in the transactions discussed above during recent fiscal years  and may result in additional transactions during fiscal and beyond 
year compliance the company has taken  and is continuing to take  actions intended to assure that its computer systems and other equipment are capable of functioning in  and processing for  periods for the year and beyond 
the company has implemented a program intended to address  on a timely basis  year compliance the need for computer applications and other systems used by the company to function in and after the year and to recognize and properly perform date sensitive functions involving dates after december  during the fourth quarter  the company upgraded its existing production and financial reporting systems 
in addition  the company tested additional equipment for compliance  met with certain key customers and suppliers to discuss potential issues  and continued to monitor whether contingency plans are needed 
software upgrades were installed in mid march and the systems were tested during the fourth quarter 
based on the current status of the company s compliance efforts  the costs associated with identified year compliance issues are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations or on the financial condition of the company 
the company has worked with its software vendors to upgrade to software versions that are year compliant 
in addition  the company has reviewed  or is in process of reviewing  equipment that uses computerized controls or imbedded processors  to help assure that such equipment will function properly in the year and beyond 
the company has not  to date  identified deficiencies which it believes cannot be corrected or which will have a material effect  either financially or operationally  on the company 
the company believes that the upgrades will allow it to address year related issues of these systems on a timely basis  however  successful implementation is subject to future events  including third party performance of these agreements 
to the extent it believes appropriate  the company has had such discussions as believed appropriate with suppliers of this equipment and has confirmed year compliance with key suppliers and customers 
given its present understanding of potential year problems  the company believes that if compliance is not achieved  the largest problem the company might experience is a delay in obtaining production and financial reporting information 
since computer software vendors have not indicated potential problems and the company has not experienced year with the software upgrades already implemented  the company has not yet developed specific contingency plans  but will do so later in calendar if circumstances would require 
the company has tested the upgrades during the fourth quarter and nothing has come to the company s attention to indicate the upgrades will not be compliant 
in the event that any automated production equipment cannot be upgraded to achieve year compliance  the internal clocks on the equipment will be set back to the year the equipment will function properly  but utilization reports would have an incorrect date 
at this time  the company does not expect that the reasonably foreseeable consequences of year compliance will have material effects on the company s business  operations or financial condition 
however  year compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be foreseeable 
therefore  there can be no assurance that unforeseen circumstances will not arise  or that the company will not in the future identify equipment or systems which are not year compliant

actual results could differ materially from those discussed 
the company has financial instruments  including notes receivable and long term debt  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
however  the company does not use any interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to limit its sensitivity to changes in interest rates because of the relatively short term nature of its notes receivable and variability of interest rates on certain of its long term debt 
the company does not believe there has been any material changes in the reported market risks faced by the company since the end of its last fiscal year  may
