the company historically has generated sufficient cash flow from operations to finance its existing operational requirements and debt service requirements  and the company anticipates that this will continue to be the case 
operating activities provided net cash of million in  million in and million in the company historically has used the proceeds of bank debt and private and public debt and equity offerings  supplemented by cash flow from operations not required to fund operational requirements and debt service  to fund implementation of the company s acquisition strategy 
the total cash financing required to consummate the pending transactions is expected to be up to million 
the company expects to receive million in cash from the completion of the disposition of wmvp am in chicago 
accordingly  the company will require up to at least million in additional financing to consummate the pending transactions 
although there can be no assurance  the company expects that million of such amount will be required to be borrowed during the second quarter of for the acquisition of phoenix 
the remaining million may be required to be borrowed for the capstar sfx transaction over the three year period in which the capstar sfx stations will be acquired 
as the result of the company s pending merger with capstar  however  the company is currently evaluating the treatment of the capstar sfx transaction assuming the capstar merger is completed 
accordingly  it is unclear when such amounts would be required to be borrowed by the company  if at all 
depending on the timing of the consummation of the pending transactions and the status of the capstar merger  the company may need to obtain additional financing 
the company believes that amounts available under the senior credit facility will be used to finance the remaining pending transactions as well as future acquisitions 
the senior credit facility currently provides for a total commitment of billion  consisting of a billion revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility 
at march   the company had drawn million of the revolving credit facility and million of the term loan facility 
other potential sources of financing for the pending transactions and future acquisitions include cash flow from operations  additional debt or equity financings  the sale of non core assets or a combination of those sources 
in addition to debt service requirements under the senior credit facility  the company is required to pay interest on cmcla s senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
interest payment requirements on these notes are million per year 
cash dividend requirements of the company on chancellor media s convertible exchangeable preferred stock and convertible preferred stock are million per year 
because the company is a holding company with no significant assets other than the common stock of chancellor mezzanine holdings corporation  the company will rely solely on dividends from chancellor mezzanine holdings corporation  which in turn is expected to distribute dividends paid to it by cmcla and other subsidiaries to the company  to permit the company to pay cash dividends on the convertible exchangeable preferred stock and the convertible preferred stock 
the senior credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes and senior subordinated notes limit  but do not prohibit  cmcla from paying such dividends to chancellor mezzanine holdings corporation
