while management believes that its plan will ultimately enable them to achieve positive cash flows from operations  until such time  additional cash may be necessary to implement such plan 
although there can be no assurances  management has several alternative sources to fund the development of its plan  including additional debt and equity financing if necessary  or additional sales of its investment in softworks common stock  which  as a consequence of softworks initial public offering  became a readily marketable asset 
since the company s ownership interest in softworks is currently  any additional sales of its investment would reduce the company s ownership interest to below 
additionally  the financial results of softworks would no longer be consolidated with the company  and  accordingly  the company s financial presentation would be significantly altered

see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of unusual charges incurred for the years ended december   and respectively 
year issues background 
some computers  software  and other equipment include programming code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than these problems are widely expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year approaches  and are commonly referred to as the millenium bug or year problem 
assessment 
the year problem could affect computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company 
accordingly  the company is reviewing its internal computer programs and systems to ensure that the programs and systems will be year compliant 
the company presently believes that its computer systems will be year compliant in a timely manner 
however  while the estimated cost of these efforts is not expected to be material to the company s overall financial position  or any year s results of operations  there can be no assurance to this effect 
the company has obtained certification of its processes to assess year problems from the information technology association of america itaa 
because the company s business involves software development  the company has not sought further verification or validation by independent third parties of its corrections of year problems 
however  the company s year project team is reviewing the company s project plans and monitoring progress against those plans 
software sold to consumers 
the company believes that it has substantially identified and resolved all potential year problems with any of the software products it develops and markets 
however  management also believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting the company s software products have been identified or corrected due to complexity of these products and the fact that these products interact with other third party vendor products and operate on computer systems which are not under the company s control 
internal infrastructure 
the company believes that it has identified substantially all of the major computers  software applications  and related equipment used in connection with its internal operations that must be modified  upgraded  or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to its business 
the company has commenced the process of modifying  upgrading  and replacing major systems that have been identified as adversely affected  and expects to complete this process before the end of june  systems other than information technology systems 
in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  photocopiers  telephone switches  security systems  elevators  and other common devices may be affected by the year problem 
the company is currently assessing the potential effect of  and costs of remediating  the year problem on its office and facilities equipment and expects to complete such assessment by the june  the company estimates the total cost to the company of completing any required modifications  upgrades  or replacements of these internal systems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
this estimate is being monitored and will be revised as additional information becomes available 
suppliers 
the company has initiated communications  including surveys  with third party suppliers of the major computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company to identify and  to the extent possible  to resolve issues involving the year problem 
however  the company has limited or no control over responses to its inquiries and the actions of these third party suppliers 
thus  while the company does not anticipate any significant year problems with these systems  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will resolve any or all of their year problems with these systems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the business of the company or any of its customers 
any failure of these third parties to resolve year problems with their systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operation 
most likely consequences of year problems 
the company expects to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially adversely affect its business operations 
however  management believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting the company have been identified or corrected 
the number of devices that could be affected and the interactions among these devices are simply too numerous 
in addition  one cannot accurately predict how many year problem related failures will occur or the severity  duration  or financial consequences of these perhaps inevitable failures 
as a result  management expects that the company could likely suffer the following a 
a significant number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for the company and its customers that may divert management s time and attention and financial and human resources from its ordinary business activities  and b 
a lesser number of serious system failures that may require significant efforts by the company or its customers to prevent or alleviate material business disruptions 
c 
the inability to determine with any degree of certainty  the changes if any  in buying habits of its current and potential customers due to their concerns over year issues 
contingency plans 
the company is currently developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of its efforts to identify and correct year problems affecting its internal systems 
the company expects to complete its contingency plans by the end of june depending on the systems affected  these plans could include accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  short to medium term use of backup equipment and software  increased work hours for company personnel or use of contract personnel to correct on an accelerated schedule any year problems that arise or to provide manual workarounds for information systems  and similar approaches 
if the company is required to implement any of these contingency plans  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
disclaimer 
the discussion of the company s efforts  and management s expectations  relating to year compliance are forward looking statements 
the company s ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  vendors ability to modify proprietary software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review
