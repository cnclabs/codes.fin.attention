item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview ames changed its fiscal year from the last saturday in january to the saturday nearest january  effective with the fiscal year ended january   which we refer to as fiscal we made this change so that our fiscal year would coincide with the fiscal year of most other publicly held retailers 
fiscal consisted of weeks

our fiscal year ended january   which we refer to as fiscal  consisted of weeks 
you should read the discussion that follows in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal on december   we acquired approximately of the outstanding voting stock of hills stores company 
accordingly  the operations of hills and its subsidiaries during the month of january are included in our consolidated results of operations for fiscal immediately following our acquisition of hills  we began implementing a series of initiatives to prepare for the conversion of of the hills stores into ames stores and the permanent closure of the five remaining hills stores 
these initiatives included the termination of most of hills corporate and administrative operations and personnel  the announced closure of seven ames stores that we considered to be directly competitive with acquired hills stores and the engagement of two experienced liquidation firms  gordon brothers retail partners and the nassi group  to operate the hills stores until their closure and to liquidate hills merchandise inventories 
under our agreement with gordon brothers and the nassi group  we are entitled to retain from the proceeds of the liquidation sales  as a minimum guaranteed amount  of the initial ticketed retail price of the inventory being sold  irrespective of the actual price at which it is sold 
the remaining sale proceeds  net of the expenses of operating the stores  are payable to the liquidators as compensation for their services  subject to additional allocations to ames to the extent the proceeds exceed specified targets 
for financial reporting purposes  hills net sales during the month of january represent the actual sale proceeds from merchandise liquidation sales  its cost of merchandise sold represents the guaranteed minimum amount that ames is entitled to retain  and its selling  general and administrative expenses include the portion of those proceeds that are to be paid over to the liquidators 
because of the unique nature of our contractual arrangements with gordon brothers and the nassi group  as well as the fact that hills stores were in the process of liquidation  hills results for the month of january are not representative of those of a retailer operating in the ordinary course of business and are not directly comparable to ames results exclusive of hills 
the acquisition of hills also resulted in various costs and charges during the month of january that impacted ames consolidated results 
these other costs and charges consisted principally of costs associated with terminating contracts that became obsolete with the acquisition of hills  the write off of deferred financing costs related to a prior credit facility  interest expense for borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition and a one time charge for the announced closing of the seven ames stores 
the following table illustrates the separate contribution of ames full year of operations and hills one month of operations to various components of the consolidated results of operations for fiscal  as well as the impact on these consolidated results of the other costs and charges described above other costs ames hills and charges consolidated in millions net sales   costs and expenses income cost of merchandise sold   selling  general and administrative expenses leased department and other income depreciation and amortization expense  net interest and debt expense  net store closing charge income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss the unique circumstances under which hills operations have been conducted since december  and the accounting treatment accorded those operations as a consequence of our agreement with gordon brothers and the nassi group distort any direct comparison of the principal components of ames consolidated results for fiscal and fiscal accordingly  in the discussion that follows  ames net sales  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expense  and its leased department and other income for fiscal are presented and compared exclusive of the hills results 
the impact of the hills acquisition is included in the comparison of depreciation and amortization expense and interest and debt expense 
ames net sales which exclude sales from leased shoe departments increased  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal  due primarily to growth in same store sales 
ames experienced particularly strong improvements in sales of domestics  toys  ready to assemble furniture and women s sportswear 
in comparing results for the two fiscal years  you should bear in mind that net sales in fiscal were favorably affected by the inclusion of a full or nearly full year of operations of two stores that were closed in the beginning of fiscal and by the fact that fiscal included one additional week of operations 
ames gross margin increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales at 
the gross margin rate in fiscal benefitted from a higher average markup on sales  which was partially offset by higher markdowns 
ames selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the percentage decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in store related expenses and advertising expense  partially offset by an increase in health and medical costs 
ames leased department and other income increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to the leased shoe department  layaway and vending income  as well as the receipt of funds previously held in a trust 
ames depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase related primarily to new point of sale systems and store automation equipment acquired under certain capital leases 
the hills acquisition added a further million of depreciation and amortization expense associated with the additional depreciation and amortization of its fixed assets and beneficial lease rights and the amortization of goodwill relating to the excess of the hills acquisition cost over the value of the acquired assets 
we are amortizing the beneficial lease rights using the straight line method over the terms of the related leases which average approximately years and are amortizing the hills goodwill over years on a straight line basis 
the amortization of the excess of our revalued net assets over equity under fresh start reporting remained the same in fiscal as in fiscal we are amortizing this amount over a ten year period that will conclude in january the hills acquisition resulted in a  or million  increase in consolidated interest expense  net of interest income  in fiscal debt and capital lease obligations of hills accounted for million of the increase 
another million of the increase was attributable to the non cash write off of deferred financing costs under ames prior credit facility 
the balance was attributable to borrowings under our bank credit agreement to finance the costs of the acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges of million in connection with the announced closing of seven ames stores that are scheduled to close in fiscal principal components of these charges are for lease costs and the write down of fixed assets 
we have also planned for the closing of five of the acquired hills stores and  pursuant to the purchase method of accounting  have provided for these closings in the valuation of the acquired hills assets

land  buildings and improvements are financed principally through long term leases 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature  with a large portion of our net sales occurring in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the back to school and christmas shopping seasons 
net sales are highest in the last fiscal quarter in fiscal 
the demand for working capital is heaviest in may  and from august through november  when sufficient merchandise must be purchased for the spring  back to school and christmas seasons  respectively 
year readiness in operating our business  we are dependent on information technology and process control systems that employ computers as well as embedded microprocessors 
we also depend on the proper functioning of the business systems of third parties  particularly the more than  vendors from whom we purchase the merchandise sold in our stores 
many computer systems and microprocessors can only process dates in which the year is represented by two digits 
as a result  some of these systems and processors may interpret incorrectly as the year instead of the year  in which event they could malfunction or become inoperable after december  systems and processors that can properly recognize the year are referred to as year compliant 
as previously reported  we initiated a comprehensive program to prepare our computer systems and applications for the year we have spent approximately million on this program through the end of fiscal and expect that full implementation of the program will involve an additional million to million  including expenditures for software and consulting services 
additionally  we estimate the allocated costs of our internal system development staff who are implementing our year initiatives to be million to million over the life of the project

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have exposure to interest rate volatility primarily relating to interest rate changes applicable to revolving loans under our bank credit facility 
these loans bear interest at rates which vary with changes in i the london interbank offered rate libor or ii a rate of interest announced publicly by bank of america nt sa 
we do not speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
as of january   approximately million of our debt bore interest at variable rates 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows would not be significant
