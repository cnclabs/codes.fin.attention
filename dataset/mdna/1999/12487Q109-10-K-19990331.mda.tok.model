the company has over the past three years been able to fund all of its working capital needs and capital expenditures from cash generated from operations 
management believes that cash flows from operations and available credit line facility will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs over the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to satisfy its liquidity needs in the future without engaging in financing activities beyond those described above 
year issue background 
some computers  software and other equipment include programming code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than year problem 
these problems are widely expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year approaches 
the company defines an application to be year compliant if it can accurately process date data including calculating  comparing and sequencing from  into and between and  including leap year calculations 
assessment 
the year problem could affect computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company 
accordingly  the company is reviewing its internal computer programs and systems to ensure that the programs and systems will be year compliant 
the company presently believes that its computer systems will be year compliant in a timely manner 
however  ccc information services group inc 
and subsidiaries while the estimated cost of these efforts are not expected to be material to the company s financial position or any year s results of operations  there can be no assurance to this effect 
software sold to customers 
the company believes that it has substantially identified all potential year problems with any of the software products  which it develops and markets 
as a key supplier to insurance companies and collision repair facilities  the company has identified a significant exposure for year problems regarding the effect of its legacy collision estimating software on some customers ability to complete an estimate 
a major undertaking is currently in process to convert those customers impacted to the year compliant version of the software 
while lost revenues from such an event are a concern for the company  the greater risks are the monetary damages for which the company could be liable if it in fact is found responsible for the shutdown of one of its customer s facilities 
such a finding could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
internal infrastructure 
the company believes that it has identified substantially all of the major computers  software applications  and related equipment  with the exception of desktop hardware and software applications  used in connection with its internal operations that must be modified  upgraded or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to its business 
the company has commenced the process of modifying  upgrading  and replacing major systems that have been identified as adversely affected  and expects to complete this process before the middle of the company expects to complete testing of desktop hardware and software applications by the second quarter of and upgrades will be scheduled as needed 
systems other than information technology systems 
in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  photocopiers  telephone switches  security systems  elevators  and other common devices may be affected by the year problem 
the company has nearly completed its assessment and expects that most facility and office equipment will be compliant by june the company estimates the total cost to the company of completing any required modifications  upgrades  or replacements of these internal systems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
currently  the company is expensing approximately thousand per quarter associated with this effort 
it is expected that this cost will continue through the fourth quarter of this estimate is being monitored and will be revised as additional information becomes available 
suppliers 
the company has initiated communications with third party suppliers of the major computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company to identify and  to the extent possible  to resolve issues involving the year problem 
however  the company has limited or no control over the actions of these third party suppliers 
thus  while the company expects that it will be able to resolve any significant year problems with these systems  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will resolve any or all year problems with these systems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the business of the company or any of its customers 
any failure of these third parties to resolve year problems with their systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operation 
most likely consequences of year problems 
the company expects to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially adversely affect its business operations 
however  management believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting the company have been identified or corrected 
the number of devices that could be affected and the interactions among these devices are simply too numerous 
in addition  one cannot accurately predict how ccc information services group inc 
and subsidiaries many year problem related failures will occur or the severity  duration  or financial consequences of these perhaps inevitable failures 
as a result  management expects that the company could likely suffer the following consequences a significant number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for the company and its customers that may divert management s time and attention and financial and human resources from its ordinary business activities  and a lesser number of serious failures that may require significant efforts by the company or its customers to prevent or alleviate material business disruptions 
although the company expects its critical systems to be compliant by mid  there is no guarantee that these results will be achieved 
specific factors that give rise to this uncertainty include a possible loss of technical resources to perform the work  failure to identify all susceptible systems  non compliance by third parties whose systems and operations impact the company  and other similar uncertainties 
a possible worst case scenario might include one or more of the company s software products sold to customers being non compliant 
such an event could result in a material disruption to the company s or customers operations 
for example  the software could experience an interruption in its ability to properly calculate or access the data required to complete a collision estimate 
should the worst case scenario occur it could  depending on its duration  have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
contingency plans 
the company is currently developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of its efforts to identify and correct year problems that may occur 
the company expects to complete its contingency plans by april depending on the systems affected  these plans could include accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  short to medium use of backup equipment and software  increased work hours for company personnel or use of contract personnel to correct on an accelerated schedule any year problems that arise or to provide manual workarounds for information systems  and similar approaches 
if the company is required to implement any of these contingency plans  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
based on the activities described above  management believes the company is devoting the necessary resources to identify and resolve year problems 
the success of this effort and a favorable outcome to the various potential situations described herein will determine the impact the year problem has on the company s business or results of operations forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
in that context  the discussion in this item contains forward looking statements which involve certain degrees of risk and uncertainties  including statements relating to liquidity and capital resources 
except for the historical information  the matters discussed in this item are such forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  the effect of competitive pricing within the industry  the presence of competitors with greater financial resources than the company  the intense competition for top software engineering talent and the volatile nature of technological change within the automobile claims industry 
additional factors that could affect the company s financial condition and results of operations are included in the company s final prospectus in connection with the registration statement on form s  as amended  filed with the securities and exchange commission on august   commission file number ccc information services group inc
