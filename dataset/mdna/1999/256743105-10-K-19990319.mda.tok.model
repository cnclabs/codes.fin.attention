the company expects the amount of cash required to purchase vehicles  net of proceeds from the sale of used vehicles  to increase in because rental fleets are increasing to meet anticipated rental demand 
the group expects to meet these cash requirements with cash provided from operations and its increased vehicle financing facilities 
the group s need for cash to finance vehicles is highly seasonal and typically peaks in the second and third quarters of the year when fleet levels build up to meet seasonal rental demand 
fleet levels are lowest in the fourth quarter when rental demand is at a seasonal low 
the group also requires cash for non vehicle capital expenditures 
these expenditures totaled million in million at dollar  million at thrifty and million for other operations  million in million at dollar  million at thrifty and million for other operations  and are estimated to be approximately million in these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash provided from operations

at december   the group had approximately million in bonds outstanding 
interest rate risk the group s results of operations depend significantly on prevailing levels of interest rates because of the large amount of debt it incurs to purchase vehicles 
in addition  the group is exposed to increases in interest rates because a portion of its debt bears interest at floating rates 
the company estimates that  in  approximately of its average debt will bear interest at floating rates 
the amount of the group s financing costs affects the amount dollar  thrifty and their franchisees must charge their customers to be profitable 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation the increased acquisition cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting the group 
many of the group s other operating expenses are also expected to increase with inflation 
management does not expect that the effect of inflation on the group s overall operating costs will be greater for the group than for its competitors 
year introduction the year issue yk relates to potential problems with computer systems or any equipment employing technology that uses dates where the date has been stored as just two digits eg for 
on january   any date recording mechanism within the computer system  including date sensitive software  which uses only two digits to represent the year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if this occurs  it could cause system failures or miscalculations resulting in disruption of operations 
the group s management recognizes the importance of ensuring that its operations and material relationships with third parties will not be negatively affected by interruptions caused from failure to be yk compliant 
the group has formed committees to address yk compliance of its operating entities 
state of readiness a formalized project began in  in which the group identified mission critical areas of information technology it for yk compliance review 
hardware  software applications and other technologies  which in the event of a failure would have a material adverse impact on the group s business  financial condition  or results of operations  are considered mission critical 
these include fleet systems  reservation systems  counter systems  revenue management systems  and financial systems 
the group is using a five phase process to review each of its systems  which includes awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
during the awareness phase  the group inventories each system to identify the components that require modification to become yk compliant 
once identified  each component is assessed for its risk of failure and the impact of potential failure to the group s operations 
during the next phase  renovation  each system component is either modified or replaced in order to meet yk requirements 
each system is then validated by installing it in a separate testing environment that will simulate the year and test for compliance 
once the results of the validation phase verify that the date change does not cause operational problems  the system is moved to the final phase of implementation  at which time it is considered to be yk compliant and returned to normal operation 
the group has completed the awareness and assessment phases and is currently in the renovation and validation phases of its mission critical it systems 
the renovation and validation phases are expected to be completed in the second and third quarters of with regard to non it systems such as phone systems  security systems  and elevator operations  the group is currently in the awareness and assessment phases of remediation 
all mission critical systems that are not already yk compliant will be modified  upgraded or replaced and are anticipated to be compliant no later than september  during the first quarter of  the group began sending inquiries to third parties with whom it transacts significant business requesting assurances of yk compliance 
the group continues to make additional inquiries to third parties seeking yk assurances as well as collecting responses  discussing concerns  and sending follow up inquiries requesting status of remediation plans 
dollar and thrifty have also been advising their independent franchisees of the need to conduct their own yk assessments 
costs the group s costs to remediate yk issues are projected to total million 
of this total  million has been incurred as of december  and million is expected to be incurred during certain it projects to enhance systems and improve operating efficiencies are being delayed due to yk compliance efforts 
the group s yk costs for and represent approximately and  respectively  of the total annual it budget and will be funded through its internal cash flow 
risks like many organizations  the group relies on third parties such as telecommunication companies  airlines  vehicle manufacturers  travel agents  credit card processors  banks  utilities  and also its independent franchisees 
the group recognizes that failure to resolve yk issues could result in disruptions in operations 
in the worst case  non compliance by the group regarding yk issues may result in significant interruptions in business flow including failure to process rental transactions efficiently and inability to invoice or process payments 
third party failures may result in additional business interruptions such as airline  faa  travel agent  and tour company failures causing reduction of travel and tourism revenues  telecommunication failures resulting in inability to process reservations and service clientele  and vehicle manufacturer or vehicle delivery source failures causing shortages of vehicles 
failure of independent franchisees to be yk compliant could result in disruptions in the dollar and thrifty vehicle rental systems  and potentially affect fees and vehicle leasing revenues received from these independent parties 
accordingly  third party yk failures could significantly limit the group s revenue earning potential and result in a material adverse effect on the group s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
contingency plans the group is in the process of developing basic contingency plans to cover all mission critical processes that could result in a material adverse impact on the group s operations 
the group plans to continually refine these plans as more information becomes available from third parties and through completion of the validation phase of the group s remediation plan 
the group intends to have a formalized contingency plan in place no later than the third quarter of management believes that the group is taking adequate actions to remediate all of its mission critical it and its non it systems 
nevertheless  since it is impossible to anticipate all future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there can be no assurance that the group will not experience disruptions in operations that could materially and adversely affect the group s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
new accounting standards effective january   the company will adopt statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use
