there can be no assurances that orc will be able to maintain the required levels of availability and be permitted to make the management fee and tax sharing fee payments to reunion 
in any event  the maximum amount of such payments is not expected to be sufficient for reunion s corporate operating and debt service requirements 
the new credit facility also provides a letter of credit guarantee to provide credit support for a supersedeas bond in the bargo litigation see item legal proceedings 
in addition to the orc assets  the facility is secured by a guarantee by mr 
bradley  a pledge of assets by stanwich financial services corp  sfsc  a related party see item certain relationships and related transactions and a pledge of the stock of orc and juliana 
since october  substantially all the amounts otherwise permitted to be paid by orc have been used to fund letter of credit and guarantee fees relating to the supersedeas bond

orc on october   orc closed the new credit facility with citbc 
this is a six year senior secured credit facility including revolving credit loans of up to million and a term loan in the initial amount of million for orc

the proceeds were used to refinance juliana s existing million loan with equitable  to repay the million month note to the joint venture partner and for working capital 
juliana plans to continue a limited wine grape development effort  which management believes will enhance the value of the property

year computer compliance the company  like most companies  utilizes electronic technology which includes computer hardware and software systems that process information and perform calculations that are date and time dependent 
the company is aware that the coming of the year yk poses pervasive and complex problems in that virtually every computer operation including manufacturing equipment and other non information systems equipment  unless it is yk compliant  will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value from to and the inadvertent recognition by electronic technology of as the year rather than yk 
the company is also aware that it may not only be negatively affected by the failure of its own systems to be yk compliant  but may also be negatively affected by the yk non compliance of its vendors  customers  lenders and any other party with which the company transacts business 
the company has completed its initial assessment of all of the systems and software in place at all locations and has identified hardware replacements and software upgrades necessary to achieve yk compliance 
because the company uses integrated accounting and manufacturing software provided by third party vendors  it has avoided internal programming costs associated with modifying code and data to handle dates past the year the latest software releases provided by the respective third party vendors have achieved yk certification from independent testing organizations 
the company is in the process of upgrading all of its software to yk compliant releases 
upgrading and testing is substantially complete at six of the company s seven manufacturing locations and at the headquarters location 
the company expects to complete the remaining upgrades by the second quarter of significant customers and outside vendors such as suppliers  banks and payroll services have been contacted and have provided assurances that they either are or will be yk compliant by june testing of the company s software and systems including manufacturing equipment and other non information systems equipment is expected to be completed during the second quarter of because management expects to complete the upgrading of all of its software early in  the company has not developed a yk contingency plan 
management regularly monitors the status of the yk compliance process  and will develop contingency plans if it appears that the company will not achieve full yk compliance 
the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur internal staff and other costs as a result of modifying existing systems to be yk compliant 
such costs will continue to be expensed as incurred and funded through internally generated cash while costs to acquire new equipment and software will be capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives 
the hardware replacements and software upgrades were principally planned to improve operating controls and implementation was not significantly accelerated 
management does not expect the incremental cost to the company of enterprise wide yk compliance to be material to its operations 
management recognizes that the failure of the company or any party with which the company conducts business to be yk compliant in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
if the company s systems were to fail because they were not yk compliant  the company would incur significant costs and inefficiencies 
manual systems for manufacturing and financial control would have to be implemented and staffed 
significant customers might decide to cease doing business with the company 
disruptions in electric power or in the delivery of materials could cause significant business interruptions 
similarly  business interruptions at significant customers could result in deferred or canceled orders 
the dates on which the company believes yk compliance will be completed are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of yk compliance 
specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced  and similar uncertainties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the yk readiness of third parties  the company cannot ensure its ability to resolve problems associated with the yk issue that may affect its operations and business  or expose it to third party liability in a timely and cost effective manner 
possible merger with chatwins and acquisitions of king way and naptech on february   the company announced that it had reinstituted its merger discussions with chatwins  which owns approximately of reunion s common stock 
the company has also had discussions regarding possible acquisitions of king way and of naptech at the same time as the chatwins merger 
king way and naptech are affiliates of chatwins and the company 
see item certain relationships and related transactions 
the company has engaged legal and financial advisors in connection with these transactions  and has held financing discussions with prospective lenders 
these transactions are subject to approval by the company s board of directors and a merger with chatwins is subject to approval by the company s and chatwins stockholders 
if such transactions are agreed to  and requisite approvals are obtained and other conditions are satisfied  the consummation of the transactions could occur as early as the second quarter of this year 
there can be no assurances that these transactions will be agreed to  or consummated 
contingencies and uncertainties on april   a jury in state district court in harris county  texas returned jury verdict findings that bargo had a right to terminate a november stock purchase agreement with the company and that the company fraudulently induced bargo into entering into the agreement 
the november stock purchase agreement concerned the sale of the company s subsidiary  rec  which operated the company s discontinued oil and gas business 
the jury recommended that an award of million in punitive damages be assessed against the company 
in july  the court entered judgment affirming the million jury verdict and awarding approximately million in attorneys fees and costs 
the company maintained at trial and continues to maintain that all requirements to closing under the contract were met  and that bargo was required to close the transaction 
the company also maintains that no evidence sufficient to support a jury finding of fraud or the related punitive damages finding was presented at trial 
the company has filed a bond which suspends execution on the judgement while the company appeals 
a formal notice of appeal has been filed and the company intends to file its appeal in april although management believes  based on consultation with counsel  that it is more likely than not that the judgment will be overturned on appeal  the company has recorded an accrual for the amount of the judgment with a charge to continuing operations in interest on the judgment at has been accrued and will continue to accrue until the litigation is resolved 
in early  the state of california franchise tax board initiated an audit of the company s franchise tax returns for the years  and in october  the company received a formal notice of assessment from the taxing authority in the aggregate amount of million plus interest 
of this amount  million results from the auditors conclusion that income from gains on sales of certain canadian oil and gas assets in should be reclassified from nonbusiness to business income 
the company believes its classification of such income was correct  and appealed the assessment of tax 
in  the company recorded a provision for approximately million for certain other proposed adjustments 
the appeal was denied  and the company requested that the case be considered for settlement 
if the company s positions prevail on this issue  management believes that the amounts due would not exceed amounts previously paid or provided for 
however  in connection with the settlement discussions  the company accrued an additional million in  with a corresponding charge to discontinued operations 
the total accrual of million represents management s estimate of the minimum of the range of possible settlement outcomes 
in connection with the sale of rec  the company retained certain oil and gas properties in louisiana because of litigation concerning environmental matters 
the company is in the process of environmental remediation under a plan approved by the louisiana office of conservation 
the company has recorded an accrual for its proportionate share of the remaining estimated costs to remediate the site based on plans and estimates developed by the environmental consultants hired by the company 
during the company increased this accrual by a charge of million to discontinued operations  based on revised estimates of the remaining remediation costs 
at december   the balance accrued for these remediation costs is approximately million 
owners of a portion of the property have objected to the company s proposed cleanup methodology and have filed suit to require additional procedures 
the company is contesting this litigation  and believes its proposed methodology is well within accepted industry practice for remediation efforts of a similar nature 
no accrual has been made for any costs of any alternative cleanup methodology which might be imposed as a result of the litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the operation of its business  the company has market risk exposures to foreign currency exchange rates  raw material prices and interest rates 
each of these risks and the company s strategies to manage the exposure is discussed below 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and ireland and sells products in those markets as well as in europe 
international sales were of the company s sales in and in the company s operating results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in europe 
the company does not actively hedge its foreign currency risk because the international operations are self financed and the translation exposure is not considered material to the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the principal raw materials used by the company are thermoplastic polymers 
these materials are available from a number of suppliers 
prices for these materials are affected by changes in market demand  and there can be no assurances that prices for these and other raw materials will not increase in the future 
the company s contracts with its customer generally provide that such price increases can be passed through to the customers 
the company s operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates 
the variable rate debt was approximately million at december   which is representative of balances outstanding during the year 
a change in interest rates would affect results of operations by approximately million
