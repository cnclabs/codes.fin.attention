these other charges credits represent the plant closing  loss on sale of certain operations  writedown of certain long lived assets and restructuring costs as presented separately in the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  and in item  selected historical financial data presented elsewhere herein 
ebitda as determined by the company may not be comparable to the ebitda measure as reported by other companies 
this presentation of ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow or operating income as measured by gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  this measure does not represent funds available for discretionary use 
it is included herein to provide additional information with respect to ability of the company to meet its future debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the fiscal operating profit for industrial products includes charges of approximately million for writedown of certain long lived assets and million for loss on sale of certain operations the fiscal operating loss for apparel fabrics includes charges of approximately million for plant closing and million for loss on sale of certain operations 
the financial statements for the period from october  to november  and the year ended october  reflect the company s emergence from chapter and were prepared utilizing the principles of fresh start reporting contained in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
as a result of the implementation of fresh start accounting  the financial information for the period from october  to november  and the year ended october  is not comparable to the financial information of prior periods 
the fiscal operating profit for industrial products includes charges of approximately million for writedown of certain long lived assets 
the fiscal operating profit for apparel fabrics includes charges of approximately million for writedown of certain long lived assets and approximately million for certain restructuring costs 
the fiscal operating loss for home fashion textiles includes charges of approximately million for writedown of certain long lived assets 
the fiscal operating loss related to indirect corporate expenses includes charges of approximately million for writedown of certain long lived assets excess reorganization costs 
the pro forma financial information was prepared for comparison purposes and gives effect to the plan of reorganization as if the transactions had occurred on october  for fiscal and november  for fiscal 
the unaudited pro forma financial information was derived by adjusting the historical consolidated financial statements of the company for the effects of fresh start accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
such adjustments primarily relate to decreased depreciation expense resulting from revaluation of the company s fixed assets  decreased interest expense resulting from extinguishment of old debt securities in the reorganization  increased amortization resulting from reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and the elimination of reorganization items  and their related tax effects 
this pro forma information is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed to be indicative of the results of operations of the company had the transactions been consummated on the respective dates indicated and are not intended to be predictive of the results of operations of the company for any future period 
results of operations the financial statements for the periods subsequent to the consummation of the plan of reorganization period from october  to november  and fiscal were prepared under the principles of fresh start reporting for companies emerging from a plan of reorganization and are not comparable to prior periods 
the company believes that the most meaningful comparisons to fiscal are made using the pro forma financial information for fiscal and and therefore this discussion addresses such pro forma information 
general comments fiscal was a disappointing year financially  however  the company continued to reposition itself as a diversified industrial and speciality products company 
recently  the company announced several important actions which should improve profitability in fiscal and beyond  and reinforce plans to pursue profitable growth strategies globally in industrial products  while continuing to streamline the apparel and yarn businesses 
with sales growth in each of the product segments through the first half of the year and continued implementation of capacity expansion and cost reduction programs in manufacturing facilities  the company was optimistic that growth targets for the year would be achieved 
in the last half of the year  however  global economic issues  adverse market conditions in electronic products and circuit boards and athletic footwear  and the continued negative impact of imported apparel fabrics  contributed to declining sales across all of the segments and margin contraction 
based on a rigorous assessment of product lines  market positions and opportunities for profitable growth  the company recently announced two strategic initiatives 
one is to close the angle plant apparel fabrics and consolidate its operations into the more modern and versatile plant in south boston  virginia 
the second initiative is to sell the boger city plant  which generates a majority of the company s home fashion textiles business 
the sale of the boger city plant should close early in the second fiscal quarter of additionally  company wide cost reduction measures were also implemented at the beginning of fiscal  which included the elimination of certain jobs at projected annualized savings of million 
the company s focus for the remainder of fiscal and the next several years remains to continue its leadership position as a manufacturer of industrial products  to continue to improve the efficiency and capacity of manufacturing facilities  to bring to market innovative new products and to expand the industrial products business globally 
fiscal compared to fiscal pro forma consolidated net sales decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal operating income loss decreased million from a pro forma operating profit of million in fiscal to an operating loss of million in fiscal fiscal results include charges for loss on writedown of certain long lived assets and certain restructuring charges which totaled approximately million 
excluding such charges for comparative purposes  operating profit in fiscal was million compared to pro forma operating profit of million in fiscal at the end of fiscal  the company implemented cost reduction measures  which included the elimination of certain jobs  resulting in projected future annual savings of approximately million 
net sales in fiscal in the industrial products segment  which includes single ply roofing and environmental membrane  woven substrates constructed of cotton  synthetics and fiberglass for lamination  insulation and filtration applications and extruded urethane products decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal sales of fiberglass products decreased million in fiscal the electronics industry represents the largest customer segment for the company s fiberglass products 
global consumer demand for electronic products did not meet expectations and  combined with other factors  including the weakness in asian economies  led to a slowdown in demand for certain fiberglass products used in the manufacture of electrical circuit boards 
management expects that demand for its fiberglass products will recover and continue to grow in the future  but such resumed growth depends  to some extent  on the timing and strength of a recovery of growth in global consumer demand for electronic products 
in fiscal  the company completed its capacity expansion and modernization program which it believes will contribute to lower costs and higher productivity in the future 
in view of this market softness  the company has taken a number of steps to improve capacity utilization including finalizing arrangements with its largest customers to purchase greater quantities of the company s production 
these aggressive marketing efforts  combined with the company s reputation for quality and service  have increased the company s market opportunities and enhanced its prospects for future growth 
net sales of roofing membrane increased million in fiscal the domestic roofing market in fiscal was characterized by intense competition and market consolidation as growth rates receded from the double digit levels of the mid s 
new and aggressive competitors in the company s market niches have presented additional challenges for growth 
the company is addressing those challenges through aggressive pricing strategies  which are supported by lower manufacturing costs  and strengthening sales management in certain key territories where such threats are most apparent 
sales of urethane products decreased million in fiscal  as a result of the decline in demand for certain of the company s products used in the manufacture of athletic footwear 
the athletic footwear industry has been depressed as a result of shifting consumer preference in casual footwear 
however  the company has initiated an aggressive marketing campaign of new product introduction to help offset the loss of sales of athletic footwear 
sales of liner membrane decreased million in fiscal due to declining unit volumes 
sales of cotton industrial products decreased million in fiscal due to declining unit volume and unit selling prices 
operating profit in fiscal for the industrial products segment decreased million from pro forma operating profit of million in fiscal to operating profit of million in fiscal fiscal included charges for writedown of certain long lived assets of approximately million 
excluding the effects of such charges  operating profit decreased by million 
lower unit prices for fiberglass products and lower unit sales in many of the industrial product groups caused the decline 
the company believes that through a series of customer agreements and other marketing improvements  future sales of industrial products will be improved 
however  price pressure is expected to continue in the foreseeable future  but will be mitigated to some degree through improvements in manufacturing efficiencies related to capital expenditures  lower raw material costs and an improved product mix 
net sales of apparel fabrics  which include unfinished woven apparel fabrics greige goods and yarn primarily for women s wear  decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal market conditions for apparel fabrics constructed primarily of filament yarn weakened during fiscal producing unit volumes and average reduced selling prices well below prior year levels 
apparel imports and shifting consumer preference in women s apparel reduced demand for domestically produced fabrics and resulted in an over produced market 
in addition  apparel manufacturers substituted lower cost imported polyester fabrics for acetate rich fabrics 
sales of fabric constructed primarily of spun yarns exceeded expectations for fiscal increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company is continuing to develop new fabric construction and styles in an effort to improve sales and profitability of its product mix 
operating profit in fiscal for the apparel fabrics group decreased million from pro forma operating profit of million in fiscal to operating profit of million in fiscal fiscal included charges of approximately million for certain restructuring costs and writedown of certain long lived assets 
excluding the effects of such charges  operating profit decreased million principally due to the lower sales volume  lower unit prices and the effects of production curtailment to manage inventory levels 
as a result of the company s assessment of the market conditions for apparel products constructed primarily of filament yarns  management concluded  subsequent to october   that its angle plant located in rocky mount  virginia  should be closed 
the plant was primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of apparel fabric constructed of filament yarns 
the results of operations for fiscal includes a charge for writedown of certain long lived assets of approximately million related principally to the loss on impairment of the plant in accordance with statement of accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company expects to complete the plant closing by the end of its fiscal third quarter and expects that the plant closure will result in improved earnings and cash flow from operations in the future 
the company estimates that approximately million in plant closing costs will be incurred in fiscal relating primarily to employee severance and plant run out costs 
additionally  in fiscal  the company implemented cost reduction measures which included  among other things  personnel reduction and the idling of certain manufacturing equipment 
the results of operations in fiscal includes charges for writedown of certain long lived assets of approximately million for asset impairment and restructuring costs of approximately million for employee severance costs 
net sales in fiscal in the home fashions textiles segment  which includes woven drapery fabrics and yarns for the home furnishings industry  decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this segment suffered from major changes by prominent retailers and shifting consumer preferences 
as a result  the company s market position deteriorated from the prior year leading to lower unit demand and generally weaker selling prices and margins 
operating profit in fiscal for the home fashion textiles segment decreased to an operating loss of million from a pro forma operating profit of million in fiscal fiscal included charges of approximately million related to a loss on impairment of certain long lived assets 
excluding the effects of such charges  operating profit decreased million due to lower demand  weaker margins and the impact of lower production 
pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement dated as of january   as amended  between jps converter and industrial corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of jps  and belding hausman incorporated  jps converter and industrial corp 
agreed to sell substantially all of the assets of its boger city plant located in lincolnton  north carolina 
this plant is primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of home fashion textiles and accounted for sales of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the consideration for the sale will consist of approximately million in cash  subject to a post closing adjustment based upon the amount of inventories transferred 
the cash proceeds will be used by the company to reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and an equipment loan 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the results of operations for fiscal includes a charge for writedown of certain long lived assets of approximately million for the excess of the carrying value of the plant over its fair value based on the estimated proceeds from the sale 
indirect corporate expenses increased million from million pro forma in fiscal to million in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 a portion of the excess reorganization costs arising from the financial restructuring was allocated to the assets of the plant being sold and the plant being closed as discussed above 
the carrying amount of such allocated excess reorganization costs of million was charged to operations in fiscal reorganization related fees and expenses incurred in fiscal totaled million 
such fees and expenses  which represent fees and expenses of the company s financial advisor  legal counsel and other professionals associated with the company s financial restructuring and the financial advisor and legal counsel for the holders of a substantial majority of the company s old outstanding bonds  have been excluded from the fiscal pro forma financial statements 
no such expenses were incurred in fiscal because of gulistan s recurring losses during fiscal  the company sold its debt and equity securities of gulistan holdings consisting of a million promissory note due in november  million of preferred stocks redeemable in november and warrants to purchase up to of the common stock of gulistan holdings 
proceeds from the sale were million 
the writedown of the carrying value of the gulistan securities to million was reported in the period from november  to october  such writedown  which totaled million in fiscal  has been excluded from the fiscal pro forma financial statements 
as a result of the application of fresh start accounting as required by statement of position sop of the american institute of certified public accountants  entitled financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code  a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million and reorganization items of approximately million were recorded as of the effective date 
the reorganization items include professional fees and expenses of approximately million discussed above and fair value adjustments of approximately million 
these items have been excluded from the fiscal pro forma financial information 
interest income and expense in fiscal are consistent with the pro forma fiscal amounts 
fiscal pro forma compared to fiscal pro forma consolidated net sales declined million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pro forma operating profit loss increased million from a pro forma operating loss of million in fiscal to a pro forma operating profit of million in fiscal fiscal results included charges for plant closing  loss on sale of certain operations  and writedown of certain long lived assets which totaled million 
excluding such charges for comparative purposes  pro forma operating profit in fiscal was million 
all segments reported improved earnings in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal in the industrial products segment increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal net sales in fiscal included million of industrial elastic sales 
the company sold its rubber products business  which produced these elastic products  in september and therefore fiscal includes no industrial elastic sales 
sales of fiberglass products increased million in fiscal primarily as a result of the continued growth in demand for fabrics used in the manufacture of electrical circuit boards 
the company expanded and enhanced its productive capacity and invested in additional machinery and equipment in order to satisfy customer demand and improve product quality 
sales of roofing membrane increased million from fiscal the company s hi tuff ep line of roofing products increased in sales as a result of the membrane s competitive price and outstanding performance characteristics 
sales of urethane products increased million from fiscal primarily as a result of stronger demand for certain of the company s products used in the manufacture of athletic footwear 
the company was successful in developing a variety of urethane film and sheet products for specific customer requirements 
sales of cotton industrial products increased million from fiscal due to improved unit volumes and selling prices 
sales of other industrial products declined million primarily as a result of the exit of certain low margin products and redirecting such weaving capacity toward more profitable goods 
pro forma operating profit in fiscal for the industrial products segment increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in the fiscal pro forma operating profit are charges of approximately million for writedown of certain long lived assets and loss on sale of operations 
adjusting for such charges  pro forma operating profit in fiscal increased by million from fiscal the increases in sales as described above  and the exit of certain low margin product lines  combined with improved operating efficiencies  increased pro forma operating income in fiscal net sales in fiscal in the apparel fabrics segment declined million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal much of this decline in net sales was expected as a result of the company s actions in fiscal to exit certain product lines which included plant closings and asset sales 
net sales in fiscal included million of apparel elastics sales 
as discussed below  the company sold its rubber products business  which produced these elastic products  in september apparel fabric sales declined million in fiscal primarily as a result of the company s decision in fiscal to close one of its facilities in greenville  south carolina and cease production of certain commodity type apparel fabrics which  due to competitive pressures from abroad  carried very weak margins 
pro forma operating profit loss in fiscal for the apparel fabrics segment increased by million from a million pro forma loss to a pro forma operating profit of million 
fiscal included charges of approximately million for plant closing and loss on sale of certain operations 
pro forma operating profit before such charges increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the improvement is the result of several factors 
fiscal results were not adversely affected by the negative operating margins associated with the product lines exited during fiscal in addition  manufacturing efficiency and productivity improved as a result of certain capital projects completed during fiscal net sales in fiscal in the home fashion textiles segment  increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of new product development and styling which resulted in higher unit volumes and selling prices 
pro forma operating profit in fiscal for the home fashion textiles segment increased million to million from million in fiscal the aforementioned volume and product mix enhancements were the primary causes for improved operating results 
substantially all of such improvement in pro forma operating increase occurred during the first half of fiscal indirect corporate expenses pro forma declined by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal pro forma expenses included a million charge resulting from an early retirement offer extended to certain salaried employees 
fiscal also included an expense of million for management services provided by a former shareholder pursuant to a management services agreement 
pursuant to the plan of reorganization on the effective date  such agreement was canceled and rejected and claims for rejection damages were waived 
accordingly  no such expense was incurred in fiscal offsetting such decreases were slightly higher employee compensation costs and insurance costs 
reorganization related fees and expenses incurred in fiscal totaled million 
these fees and expenses totaled million in fiscal the writedown of the carrying value of the gulistan securities totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal and has been excluded from the pro forma financial statements 
pro forma interest income and expense in fiscal were consistent with the pro forma amounts in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity for operations and expansion are funds generated internally and borrowings under its revolving credit facility as defined below 
on october   elastomerics and c i the borrowing subsidiaries and jps entered into the credit facility agreement  the credit agreement  by and among the financial institutions party thereto  citibank  as agent  and nationsbank  na  as co agent 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit loan facility and letters of credit the revolving credit facility in a maximum principal amount equal to the lesser of a million and b a specified borrowing base the borrowing base  which is based upon eligible receivables  eligible inventory and a specified dollar amount currently  subject to reduction based on fixed assets of the borrowing subsidiaries  except that i no borrowing subsidiary may borrow an amount greater than the borrowing base attributable to it less any reserves as specified in the credit agreement and ii letters of credit may not exceed million in the aggregate 
the credit agreement contains restrictions on investments  acquisitions and dividends unless  among other things  the company satisfies a specified pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio and maintains a specified minimum availability under the revolving credit facility for a stated period of time  and no default exists under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also restricts  among other things  indebtedness  liens  affiliate transactions  operating leases  fundamental changes and asset sales other than the sale of up to million of fixed assets  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants relating to minimum levels of ebitda  minimum interest coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditures 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is october  on october   the credit agreement was amended to  among other things i modify the financial covenants relating to minimum levels of ebitda  minimum interest coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditures  ii modify the interest rate margin and unused commitment fees and iii provide additional reduction of the fixed asset portion of the borrowing base 
as of october   the company was in compliance with these restrictions and all financial covenants  as amended 
all loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility  as amended  bear interest at either the eurodollar rate as defined in the credit agreement or the base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin the applicable margin based upon the company s fixed charge coverage ratio which margin will not exceed for eurodollar rate borrowings and 
for base rate borrowings 
the weighted average interest rate at october  is approximately 
the company pays a fee of 
per annum if a specified fixed charge coverage ratio is satisfied and a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar rate borrowings 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are made or repaid on a daily basis in amounts equal to the net cash requirements or proceeds for that business day 
as of october   unused and outstanding letters of credit totaled  the outstanding letters of credit reduce the funds available under the revolving credit facility 
at october   the company had approximately million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operations increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to the combined periods from november  to october  and october  to november  fiscal primarily due to the fact that fiscal included payment of million to holders of the notes and notes and certain interest payments associated with the old debt securities 
working capital at october  was approximately million compared to million at november   principally due to the estimated proceeds from the plant sale discussed above 
accounts receivable decreased by approximately million at october  compared to november  due principally to a decrease in sales in fiscal and the timing of customer receipts 
inventories increased by approximately million in fiscal as a result of the lower sales volume 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased approximately million in fiscal principally due to lower operating activity in the later part of the year 
the principal use of cash in fiscal was for property  plant and equipment expenditures of million for upgrade and capacity improvements for the company s manufacturing operations 
as of october  the company had commitments of for capital expenditures 
the company anticipates making capital expenditures in fiscal of approximately million and expects such amounts to be funded by cash from operations  bank and other equipment financing sources 
on august   the company reduced its long term debt and related investments by repaying all of the approximately million in principal amount of jps capital s contingent notes 
in fiscal  the company entered into a seven year lease agreement classified as capital lease for certain machinery and equipment 
the total cost of the assets to be covered by the lease is limited to approximately million 
the total cost of assets under lease at october  was approximately million 
the lease provides for an early buyout option at the end of six years and includes purchase and renewal options at fair market value at the end of the lease term 
based upon the company s ability to generate working capital through its operations and its revolving credit facility  the company believes that it has the financial resources necessary to pay its capital obligations and implement its business plan for at least the next twelve months 
inflation and tax matters the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
it has generally been able to pass along inflationary increases in its costs by increasing the prices for its products  however  market conditions sometimes preclude this practice 
for the fiscal year ending october  the company recorded a tax expense of million 
a tax expense was recorded even though the company had current year losses 
this expense was due to the nondeductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes and the recording of an additional valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax assets 
the nondeductible items consist primarily of reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
the additional valuation allowance was provided based on management s assessment of the ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
for the period from october  to november   the company recorded a tax expense of million 
the tax expense for the period ending november  includes the utilization of a portion of the deferred tax asset  described below  which was recorded as of the effective date of the plan of reorganization of the company 
the effective tax rate exceeds the statutory federal income tax rate due to the impact of items not deductible for federal income tax purposes and because of state income taxes 
the company recorded a tax benefit for the period ending october  of approximately million 
this consists of a benefit from the implementation of the plan of reorganization net of state taxes on subsidiary operations that could not be offset by operating loss carryovers or current year losses of jps or its subsidiaries 
the benefit arose as consummation of the plan of reorganization substantially deleveraged jps 
accordingly  the reserve established against the deferred tax assets that was required due to the operating history was significantly reduced 
however  the deferred tax asset attributable to the net operating loss carryforwards was also reduced as a result of the reduction in net operating loss carryforwards that is required for reorganizations such as that provided in the plan of reorganization 
the reduction in reserves and reduction in deferred tax liabilities exceeded the reduction in the gross deferred tax asset by a net amount of million thus resulting in a deferred tax benefit 
the recording of the tax benefit and the net deferred tax asset reflects the company s determination that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  will be realized based on current income tax laws and expectations of future taxable income stemming from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or operations 
uncertainties surrounding income tax law changes  shifts in operations between state taxing jurisdictions and future operating income levels may  however  affect the ultimate realization of all or some portion of these deferred income tax assets 
in addition  the company evaluates the valuation allowance on quarterly basis to determine whether or not adjustment is required 
there was no adjustment to the valuation allowance for the period ending november  the internal revenue code the code provides that there are no taxes payable on gains such as the extraordinary gain on early extinguishment of debt that was realized on the reorganization of the company in the period from november  to october  however  the company was required under provisions of the code to reduce certain net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes as a result of such gain 
beginning net operating loss carryovers were reduced by approximately million 
in addition  alternative minimum tax credit carryovers were reduced by approximately million 
as a result of valuation allowances on these assets  there was no tax expense attributable to such reductions 
in addition to attribute reduction  any remaining net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to the limitations imposed by section of the code 
the effect of these limitations was to limit the utilization of the approximately million in remaining net operating loss carryovers and certain other attributes to an annual amount of approximately million subject to certain adjustments 
the company recorded a net million income tax benefit on continuing operations in fiscal the company had a million deferred state tax benefit from the charge for the plant closing and writedown of certain long lived assets 
while no tax expense resulted from applying the statutory tax rate to the loss before income taxes  the company was not able to fully offset subsidiary income in all tax jurisdictions with net operating losses of the company or other subsidiaries or operating loss carryovers 
as a result  a million provision for state income taxes was required in fiscal during fiscal  the company utilized approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset the gain on sale of the automotive assets 
income tax expense incident to the sale was reduced by approximately million as a result of such utilization 
federal alternative minimum and state taxes of approximately million were recognized as a result of the sale 
although the company believed use of its net operating loss carryforwards to offset the gain on the automotive assets would more likely than not be sustained under existing tax laws  uncertainty existed primarily due to the fact that applicable regulations under section of the code had not been issued 
therefore  in accordance with provisions of the indentures governing the old debt securities  the company set aside  in a special purpose subsidiary  a portion million of the net proceeds from the sale of the automotive assets to satisfy  if necessary  these possible contingent tax liabilities 
as of november  and november   the aggregate fair value of the investments was approximately million and million  respectively 
under the terms of the plan of reorganization  the holders of the and notes received million in cash from these investments and contingent notes with an aggregate principal amount of million payable from these investments upon the occurrence of certain events 
the respective amounts of the cash distribution and the initial principal amount of the contingent notes were determined based on the assumptions used to determine the original amount set aside for contingent tax liabilities related to the sale of the company s automotive business with adjustments for certain events arising subsequent to the sale and such original determination 
a current liability in an amount equal to the approximate aggregate fair value of invested funds was recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of november  in accordance with the indenture for the contingent notes  during a determination was made that the maturity date as defined in the indenture would occur on august  funds in the amount of  were placed with the paying agent on or before august  on august  the contingent notes were no longer deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such notes ceased  other than the right of the holders thereof to receive the principal amount and accrued interest as defined payable under each contingent note held by them 
even before giving effect to the previously described limitations on use of net operating loss carryforwards occurring under the plan of reorganization  due to the company s operating history  it was uncertain that it would be able to utilize all deferred tax assets 
therefore  for years ending prior to november   a valuation allowance had been provided equal to the deferred tax assets remaining after deducting all deferred tax liabilities  exclusive of those related to certain deferred state tax liabilities 
as described above  a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed and a tax benefit recognized upon the effective date of the plan of reorganization 
year compliance description of year issue as a result of the existence of computer programs and chips embedded in process control equipment that use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  a concern commonly known as year has arisen globally 
computer programs and equipment having time sensitive software or imbedded processors may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  such as production shutdowns  or a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
mission critical applications which could be impacted include purchasing and inventory management  production control  general ledger accounting  billing  payroll and disbursements 
the company s plan in fiscal  the company conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify those systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the company has developed and is currently implementing its plan to address the year issue 
task teams led by senior executives identified six project phases including i inventory of systems and process exposure  ii risk assessment and prioritization  iii remediation of non compliant systems  iv testing and development of compliant systems  v maintenance once compliance is achieved and vi contingency planning 
the company has completed the inventory and risk assessment phases and is currently in the remediation and testing phases of the project 
remediation involves repair of existing systems and equipment  and  in some cases  complete replacement with purchased systems and equipment that are year compliant 
replaced and modified systems are subjected to rigorous testing in a non production environment in parallel with production data and  once deployed  are continually monitored for compliance 
activities to maintain such compliance include monitoring of reprogrammed systems once back in production  audits of critical systems  vendor compliance certifications and testing of contingency plans 
management has also reviewed production equipment used in its operations and has performed a written survey of its equipment vendors to certify that the systems imbedded in sophisticated production equipment are year compliant 
in addition  all new equipment purchases are screened for year compliance 
the company expects that the remediation phase will be substantially completed by the end of august however  testing and maintenance will continue throughout the company has prepared and mailed letters to vendors and service providers to discern their year compliance status and testing procedures 
most of these vendors and service providers supply raw materials and equipment to the company 
the majority of responses have been received and no negative responses have been received 
however  many of the responses will require additional follow up which is to be completed by september the company is in the initial steps of developing contingency plans for its mission critical applications 
the contingency plans will address i the development of a contingency planning framework  including common approaches and criteria  ii clear assignment of accountability for executing the contingency planning framework  iii monitoring of results and iv testing and validation 
it is anticipated the contingency plans will enable the business to continue in the event there are any system interruptions 
costs associated with year compliance the incremental cost of addressing the year issue will be substantially absorbed in the normal budget for improvement in management information systems and by normal costs for administrative and technical employees 
the company  however  retains contract programmers to work on discrete projects and will continue this practice into the foreseeable future 
the incremental cost of addressing the year issue is estimated at  with  having been spent as of october  most of these expenditures have been for remediation or replacement of existing systems 
management believes that the cost of year modifications will not have a material effect on results of operations 
the estimated cost of the year project and the dates on which the company believes it will be completed are based on management s best estimate 
there can be no assurances that these estimates will not change 
specific factors that could cause material differences with actual results include  but are not limited to  the results of testing and the timeliness and effectiveness of remediation efforts of third parties 
risks presented by year issues there can be no assurance given that any or all of the company s systems are or will be year compliant 
a failure by the company to resolve a material year issue could result in an interruption in  or failure of  normal business operations and could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition 
in addition  due to the uncertainties inherent in the year problem  the company cannot insure that its most important vendors  customers and service providers will be year compliant on time 
the failure of critical third parties to timely correct their year problems could materially and adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition  even resulting in an interruption in normal business operations if a critical supplier is unable to meet commitments in a timely manner 
however  as a result of the activities described above  and assuming the remaining project phases are completed in satisfactory manner  management believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer or process systems 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no
