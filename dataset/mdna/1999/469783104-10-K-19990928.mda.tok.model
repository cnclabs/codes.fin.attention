results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in the company s statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating profit loss interest expense earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net earnings loss comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were  a decrease of  or  as compared to  reported for fiscal the company s net sales were impacted throughout the fiscal year by continued industry wide pricing pressures  compounded by weak demand for components which has impacted the electronics industry for over three years 
toward the end of fiscal  the company experienced an increase in activity in many product sectors 
as the new fiscal year begins  demand for product continues to be strong 
the company believes it is positioned well for growth  having continued expanding its flat panel display group  strengthening its field application engineering fae program  and by adding sales and marketing personnel 
gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease was attributable to industry wide pressures and a shift in product mix toward a greater amount of active components  including flat panel devices  which historically  have a lower gross profit margin compared to passive components 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal due to the weakness in the electronics industry during fiscal  the company had implemented cost containment measures 
additionally  sg a decreased as a result of the decrease in gross profit dollars compared to fiscal variable costs such as commissions paid to sales personnel decreased 
the decreases were partially offset by a bad debt of approximately  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and additional staffing of sales and marketing personnel toward the end of fiscal in anticipation of an improvement in demand for electronic components 
interest expense increased to approximately million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to increased net borrowings due to the company s purchases of its common stock under its stock repurchase program  fixed asset additions primarily for contract manufacturing  operational expenditures made to upgrade the company s core financial and reporting software  and an increase in borrowing rates 
net loss for fiscal was  or 
per share diluted  as compared to net earnings for fiscal of  or 
per share diluted 
during fiscal  the decrease in net earnings was primarily attributable to the decrease in net sales and decrease in gross profit dollars attributable to the overall industry weakness as it related to electronic components 
the company is cautiously optimistic that it is better positioned for increased performance during the future period based on the strengthening of the electronics industry and expenditures made during fiscal comparison of fiscal year ended june  with fiscal year ended june  fiscal net sales for the year ended june  decreased approximately to  as compared to  reported for the same fiscal period 
fiscal results reflect the continuing industry wide pressures on pricing  compounded by the softening demand for electronic components 
the decrease in component sales through the company s distribution operations was partially offset by a million  or  increase in sales from contract manufacturing 
the company s long term plan includes optimizing value added services  such as flat panel displays and contract manufacturing 
gross profit margins  as a percentage of net sales  remained constant at in fiscal  compared to fiscal while unit pricing continued to decline during fiscal  as a result of price protection and inventory rotation extended to the company by its suppliers  the company was able to maintain gross profit margins 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or from million in fiscal the company s addition of sales and sales management personnel  the expansion of the field application engineering fae program  and the addition of the flat panel display group have contributed to the increase in sg a expenses 
due to the continuing weakness in the electronics industry  the company closely reviewed sg a and implemented cost containment measures in the fiscal year ended june   which  it believed  would not have a negative impact on sales 
interest expense increased to approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of additional borrowings under the credit facility for the acquisition of new inventory as further franchises were added in fiscal the company believed that the addition of such product lines would have a favorable impact on sales during future periods 
the company s acquisition of approximately  of new equipment to support the growth in contract manufacturing also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
net earnings for fiscal were million  or approximately 
per share fully diluted  as compared to million  or approximately 
per share fully diluted for fiscal during fiscal  the decrease in net earnings was primarily attributable to the increase in sg a 
liquidity and capital resources the company s agreement with its banks  as amended  provides the company with a  term loan and revolving line of credit facility based principally on eligible accounts receivable and inventories of the company as defined in the agreement which expires september  the interest rate of the credit facility is based on the average day libor rate plus to depending on the company s performance for the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters measured by a certain financial ratio  and may be adjusted quarterly 
the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit facility was  at june  the term loan  with a remaining balance of  at june   requires monthly principal payments of  together with interest through september   with a final payment of  due on september  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the agreement contains provisions for maintenance of certain financial ratios  all of which the company is in compliance with at june   and prohibits the payment of cash dividends 
during fiscal  the company s net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for fiscal  a decrease of 
million 
the principal portion of the cash flow resulted from the decrease in inventory 
this was offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
net borrowing under the company s line of credit was approximately million 
the additional borrowing is partially attributable to the purchase of 
million of treasury stock along with capital expenditures for equipment required to support the contract manufacturing business  and software developed to operate the company s distribution business 
the company s cash expenditures may vary significantly from current levels  based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  future acquisitions  if any 
for fiscal and fiscal  inventory turnover was x and x  respectively 
the average days outstanding of the company s accounts receivable at june  was days  as compared to days at june  the board of directors of the company had authorized the purchase of up to  shares of its common stock under a stock repurchase program 
during fiscal the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock 
the purchase may be made by the company from time to time on the open market at the company s discretion and will be dependent on market conditions 
through september   the company has purchased  shares of its common stock for aggregate consideration of  under this program 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance the year yk issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
such computer systems will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
in april  the company developed a three phase program for yk information systems compliance 
phase i was to identify those systems with which the company has exposure to yk issues 
phase ii was the development and implementation of action plans to be yk compliant in all areas by late phase iii  to be fully completed by mid  is the final major area of exposure to ensure compliance 
the company has identified three major areas determined to be critical for successful yk compliance financial and informational system applications  manufacturing applications and third party relationships 
as of september   jaco completed the redesign and development of an entirely new distribution software system 
all of the dates in this new database are characters  including the century 
the system has been tested and has been in operation since september  the systems include customer order entry  purchase order entry to the company s manufacturers  warehousing and inventory control 
the financial systems  accounts payable and general ledger have been yk compliant since april the accounts receivable system is yk complaint as of september  jaco s distribution facilities warehouse  shipping and other physical handling have been tested and are believed to be yk compliant 
the company  as it relates to the contract manufacturing operations in accordance with phase i of the program  is in the process of conducting an internal review of all systems and contacting all software suppliers to determine major areas of exposure to yk issues 
in the financial and information system area a number of applications have been identified as yk compliant due to their recent implementation 
the contract manufacturing core financial and reporting systems are not yk compliant but are scheduled to be complete and fully tested by late as a contingency plan  these systems can be performed manually 
the costs relating to yk compliance in the contract manufacturing area are not expected to be material to the company 
in the third party area  the company has contacted most of its major suppliers and vendors 
these parties state that they intend to be yk compliant by the year the company s management is in the process of developing a worst case scenario with respect to yk non compliance and to develop contingency plans designed to minimize the effects of such scenario 
although management believes that it is very unlikely that the worst case scenario will occur  contingency plans will be developed and will address both it information technology system and non it system items containing embedded chips  such as elevators electronic door locks  telephone  etc 
failure 
in the event of yk related it system failure  the company would be unable to ship orders because its power system would not be functioning 
in such event  the company plans to use its own generators as a back up power source 
in terms of non it and third party yk non compliance  the worst case scenario for the company would involve the loss of supply of component parts or other materials from one or more of its major suppliers 
the company believes it has made contingency plans with its vendors to have product available 
there is still uncertainty about the broader scope of the year issue as it may affect the company and third parties that are critical to our operations 
for example  lack of readiness by electrical and water utilities  financial institutions  governmental agencies or other providers of general infrastructure could pose significant impediments to the company s ability to carry on our normal operations 
the company intends to request assurances of yk readiness from its telephone and utilities suppliers 
however  management has been informed that some suppliers have either declined to provide the requested assurances  or have limited the scope of assurances to which they are willing to permit 
if suppliers of services that are critical to the company s operations were to experience business disruptions as a result of their lack of yk readiness their problems could have a material adverse affect on the financial position and results of operations of the company 
the impact of a failure of readiness by critical suppliers cannot be estimated with confidence  and the effectiveness of contingency plans to mitigate the effect of any such failure is largely untested 
management cannot provide an assurance that there will be no material adverse effects to the financial condition or results of operations of the company as a result of yk issues 
the company has spent to date approximately million to replace the core financial and reporting software systems for its distribution business 
the company has utilized outside consultants to undertake a portion of the work 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the last three fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to its credit facility with a financial institution which is priced based on the average day libor rate plus to depending on the company s performance for the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters measured by a certain financial ratio  and may be adjusted quarterly 
at august    was outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in the libor interest rate during the fiscal year ending june  will have a positive or negative effect on the company s interest expense 
each fluctuation in the libor interest rate will increase or decrease interest expense for the company by approximately  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on other floating rate debt of the company is not material
