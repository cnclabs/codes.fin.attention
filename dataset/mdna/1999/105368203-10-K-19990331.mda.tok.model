funds from operations management generally considers funds from operations ffo as one measure of reit performance 
ffo is calculated as net income loss adjusted for depreciation expense attributable to real property  amortization expense attributable to capitalized leasing costs  gains on sales of real estate investments and extraordinary and nonrecurring items and comparable adjustments for real estate ventures accounted for using the equity method 
management believes that ffo is a useful disclosure in the real estate industry  however  the company s disclosure may not be comparable to other reit s 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s operating performance or to operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo for the years ended december  and is summarized in the following table in thousands  except share data 
year ended december  income before gains on sale  minority interest and extraordinary item   add deduct depreciation attributable to real property   amortization attributable to leasing costs  depreciation attributable to real estate ventures funds from operations before minority interest   weighted average common shares including common share equivalents and operating partnership units   year compliance the year compliance issue concerns the inability of computerized information systems to accurately calculate  store or use a date after this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and all organizations 
the company recognizes the importance of ensuring that its business operations are not disrupted as a result of year related computer system and software issues 
the company is currently upgrading its internal computer information systems as a normal part of its business 
during this conversion  the company will assess the new hardware and software systems for year compliance 
the company expects to complete its conversion by june  at an estimated cost of  the planned conversion was not accelerated  nor were incremental costs incurred as a result of the year issue 
the company is currently evaluating and assessing those computer systems that do not relate to information technology such as systems designed to operate a building  which typically include embedded technology  including  without limitation  its telecommunication systems  security systems such as card access door lock systems  energy management systems  sprinkler systems and elevator systems 
the company s year compliance program is being centrally coordinated  but involves all property management personnel 
for each of the company s properties  compliance letters have been sent to the manufacturers of key operational systems  third party service providers and vendors 
in the event a satisfactory response is not received  the company intends to consider changing service providers  testing systems for compliance  replacing systems  or pursuing alternative measures to ensure year compliance 
this assessment is approximately complete for properties owned by the company as of december  the total cost of bringing these internal systems and equipment into year compliance has not been quantified 
the company is unable to determine  based on available information  whether these costs will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company expects to be year compliant by june  the company is currently evaluating the consequences of a potential failure to remediate these matters on time and is in the process of developing contingency plans regarding these matters 
the company expects to have such contingency plans in place by june  under a most reasonably likely worst case scenario  until systems became operational  the company would resort to a combination of temporary hiring  operational system repair or replacement and alternative software to process normal accounts and financial information 
further  no estimates have been made as to any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third party service providers including  without limitation  its banks  its payroll processor and its telecommunications providers vendors and tenants to prepare for the year the company is attempting to identify those risks that could have a material impact on the company s operations by june  and is also attempting to receive compliance certificates from all third parties that could have a material impact on the company s operations by june  although the company is in the process of working with such third parties in order to attempt to eliminate its year concerns the cost to the company of the third party year compliance has not been quantified 
the company would consider changing to third party service providers and vendors who are year compliant before incurring any significant additional costs 
to date  the company has not expended significant funds to assess its year issues  as the company s evaluation of its year concerns has been conducted by its own personnel at routine staffing levels and without any out of pocket expenses for consultants 
the company s evaluation has not been subject to any independent verification or review process 
inflation a majority of the company s leases provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses either on a triple net basis or over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measure 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will be significantly offset by the expense reimbursement and contractual rent increases 
interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates 
the range of changes chosen reflects the company s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen 
the company s financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   the company s consolidated debt portfolio consists of million fixed rate mortgages with maturities through  million in floating rate mortgage notes  and million borrowed under its credit facilities 
all financial instruments entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the company s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their actual levels at december  with all other variables held constant 
as of december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the net financial instrument position of million and a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the net financial instrument position of million 
based on the variable rate debt included in the company s debt portfolio on december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest incurred per year and a basis point decline would reduce interest incurred by million per year
