the company s collection personnel regularly contact customers with receivable balances outstanding beyond days to expedite collection 
if these collection efforts are unsuccessful  the company may discontinue merchandise shipments until the outstanding balance is paid

as a result  the company has developed a plan to review and  as appropriate  modify or replace the software and replace some hardware in its computer systems 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software  conversions to new software and replacement of some hardware  the year issue will be satisfactorily resolved in its own systems 
the company has established an internal auditing process to tract and verify the results of its plan and tests 
the company has substantially completed the renovation  validation and implementation phases of its plan with respect to its mission critical systems 
the company is also working with key external parties with whom it has important financial and operational relationships  including banks  utilities and other vendors and third party payors  to assess the remediation efforts made by these parties with respect to their own systems and to determine the extent to which such systems are vulnerable to the year issue 
the company has not yet received sufficient information from these parties about their remediation plans to predict the outcome of their efforts 
the company is also developing a contingency plan that is expected to address financial and operational problems that might arise on and around january  this contingency plan would include identifying back up processes that do not rely on computers whenever possible 
the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur expenses allocable to internal staff  as well as costs for outside consultants  and computer systems remediation and replacement in order to achieve year compliance 
the company completed the conversion of its primary software programs in november and testing occurred in the first quarter of the company currently estimates that these costs will total approximately million  million of which was incurred in the costs of the year program and the date on which the company plans to complete year modifications are based on current estimates  which reflect numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  the timing and effectiveness of third party remediation plans and other factors 
the company can give no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from the company s plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct relevant computer source codes and embedded technology  the results of internal and external testing and the timelessness and the effectiveness of remediation efforts of third parties 
if the modifications and conversions referred to above are not made or are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  even if these changes are successful  failure of third parties to which the company is financially or operationally linked to address their own system problems could have a material adverse effect on the company 
backlog and seasonality the company s business is impacted by the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the apparel and retail industries 
in the company s segment of the apparel industry  sales are generally higher in the first and third quarters 
historically  the company has taken greater markdowns in the second and fourth quarters 
the company generally receives orders for its products three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to stores 
as of december   the company had unfilled orders of approximately million  compared to approximately million of such orders as of december  the backlog or orders at any given time is affected by a number of factors  including seasonality  weather conditions  scheduling or manufacturing and shipment of products 
these factors  increased competition  and continued sluggishness in the retail apparel contributed to the decrease in backlog from december  to december  as the time of the shipment of products may vary from year to year  the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results for the full year 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on its net sales or profitability 
although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which the company s products are manufactured  the company does not believe that they have had a material effect on the company s net sales or profitability
