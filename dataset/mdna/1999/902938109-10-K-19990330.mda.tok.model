year compliance the inability of computers  software and other equipment using microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a two digit year is commonly referred to as the year problem 
as the year approaches  such systems may be unable to accurately process certain datebased information 
this section discusses the processes currently being implemented with respect to issues relating to the year readiness the company initiated its year project in late with a complete review of all products  manufacturing facilities  information systems and the impact on the company from customers and suppliers that may fail to deal with the issue 
the year issues that need to be addressed within the organization pertain to the company s internal information systems that date stamp transactions 
the conversion of all current applications  operating systems  databases  and edi transactions with year issues is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of products the year issue with respect to the company s product line is minimal since its products are not date sensitive and require no internal or external date tracking 
manufacturing facilities all existing pieces of machinery and equipment have been reviewed and examined and management believes that any year issues with respect to such machinery and equipment will not affect production or delivery of the company s products since the equipment is not date reliant and the movement of products is a manual process 
information systems year issues with respect to information systems  have been addressed in six major areas i 
operating systems ii 
databases iii 
business systems iv 
support systems v 
backup systems vi 
hardware platforms the following discusses the status of each area operating system the company has been advised by its software vendors that all existing operating systems it uses  novell  windows nt  unit d  and windows  currently are year compliant 
databases the company has been advised by its software vendors that all databases used by the company s current systems and anticipated new systems are year compliant 
business systems by the end of the st quarter of all existing business systems will be year compliant

customers the company has responded to all customers who have requested year compliance information  plans  and due dates 
suppliers the company has contacted its major suppliers and has asked them to respond to questions concerning their ability to be year compliant on a timely basis 
the company plans to monitor the information received in response to these inquiries on a continuous basis into the year the final analysis of the responses  which is expected to be completed during the st quarter of  will determine the need and extent for contingency planning 
cost of year readiness based on management s assessment of systems  the cost of addressing year issues is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
to date  the year conversion costs incurred are approximately  and should not exceed  conversion costs do not include funds spent by the company on the purchase of its oracle system  which would have been acquired irrespective of any year issues 
risk of the company s year issues achieving year compliance is dependent on many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the company has  or will be able to identify  all aspects of its business that are subject to year problems of its customers or suppliers 
there also can be no assurance that the company s software vendors are correct in their assertions that the software is year compliant  or that the company s estimate of the costs of systems preparation for the year will prove to be accurate 
should either the company s internal systems or internal systems of one or more significant suppliers or customers fail to achieve year compliance  or the company s estimate of the costs of becoming year compliant prove to be materially inaccurate  the company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected
