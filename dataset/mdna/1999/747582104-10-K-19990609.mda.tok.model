results of operations 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net revenues represented by each item in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the consolidated statements of operations include the operations of clinitec from may  the date of its acquisition through march  and the operations of micromed from may  the date of its acquisition through march  year ended march  net revenues sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies maintenance and other services cost of products and services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development costs purchased in process research and development income loss from operations investment income income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss for the years ended march  and for the year ended march   the company s net income was  or per share on a basic and diluted basis 
in comparison  after recognizing a million charge for purchased in process research and development in connection with the micromed acquisition  the company incurred a net loss of million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  for the year ended march  excluding the charge  net of the related income tax benefit  net income for the year ended march  would have been million  or per share and per share on a basic and diluted basis  respectively 
net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies decreased to million from million while net revenues from maintenance and other services grew to million from million during the comparable periods 
the decrease in net revenues from sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies was principally due to the impact of adopting sop as of april  resulting in the deferral of certain revenues from system contracts executed and shipped during the year ended march  combined with the effect of a slight decrease in new system sales during fiscal the increase in maintenance and other services net revenue resulted principally from an increase in revenues from the company s increased client base together with an increase in revenues generated from the company s electronic data interchange services 
cost of products and services 
cost of products and services for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  while cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenues increased to from during the comparable periods 
the increase in cost of products and services in amount during the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year resulted from a combination of the effects of the increase in maintenance and other service revenues  increased product development  customer service  support  and training personnel at both clinitec and micromed during the fiscal year  a change in the mix of new systems sales toward systems with higher hardware content in the fiscal year  and  the impact of the acquisition of micromed 
the increase in the cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  resulted primarily from a combination of the overall increase in the costs associated with the above described infrastructure expansion growing at a proportionately greater rate on a year to year basis than the growth in net revenues together with an increase in the percentage of revenues from new systems sales with higher hardware content 
systems sales with significant hardware components generally yield lower margins than those systems sales without significant hardware components 
the mixture of sales with and without significant hardware components fluctuates from period to period 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  primarily as a result of the inclusion of such micromed expenses for the entire year ended march  as compared to the inclusion of such micromed expenses for only that portion of the corresponding year ended march  following the may micromed acquisition  an additional  provision for doubtful accounts relating to one of micromed s customers  an increase in clinitec s and micromed s selling efforts  sales personnel and administrative infrastructure offset in part by a decrease in such infrastructure at qsi 
in addition  primarily as a result of the less mature clinitec and micromed infrastructures  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively unchanged at and for the respective years despite an increase in net revenues 
research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  the increase is the result of increased research and development efforts by clinitec and micromed as well as consolidation of micromed s research and development costs for the entire fiscal year as compared to consolidating such expenses only for that portion of the corresponding fiscal year following the may purchase of the micromed business 
research and development costs as a percentage of net revenues increased to as compared to for the respective fiscal years as a result of the effect of costs associated with the increased research and development efforts growing at a proportionately greater rate than net revenues during the comparable years 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of micromed in may  the purchase price allocated to in process research and development for which technological feasibility had not been established was million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  software development costs must be expensed until technological feasibility has been established 
accordingly  the purchase price allocated to micromed s purchased in process research and development was expensed during the year ended march  there was no similar acquisition transaction during the year ended march  investment income 
investment income for the year ended march  decreased to  from  for the year ended march  the company had an investment in a fund which traded in special situation securities 
during the year ended march   the investment was liquidated and the company incurred a loss of  after recognizing an unrealized gain of  during fiscal relating to this investment 
over the life of this investment  the company incurred a net gain of  in connection therewith 
also contributing to the change in investment income for the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year was a decrease in average funds available for investment during the year ended march  the decrease in available funds is primarily the result of the timing and amounts of the cash payments in may and june made to acquire micromed  together with amounts used to fund the growth of clinitec and micromed 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was  as compared to a benefit of million for the year ended march  the provision for and benefit from income taxes for the years ended march  and  respectively  differ from the combined statutory rates primarily due to the effect of varying state tax rates together with the impact of non deductible amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the may acquisition of clinitec 
for the years ended march  and the company incurred a net loss of million  or on a basic and diluted per share basis  for the year ended march  as compared to a net loss of million  or on a basic and diluted per share basis  for the year ended march  during fiscal  the company recognized a million charge  net of the related million tax benefit  for purchased in process research and development in connection with the micromed acquisition 
similarly  during fiscal  the company recognized an million charge  net of the related tax benefit  for purchased in process research and development in connection with the clinitec acquisition 
excluding the charge  net of the related income tax benefit  for purchased in process research and development  on a pro forma basis  net income and basic and diluted income per share for fiscal would have been million  and  respectively  and  and  respectively  for fiscal net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  after the consolidation of micromed s net revenues in fiscal without the inclusion of micromed s revenues  the company s sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal net revenues from maintenance and other services during the year ended march  grew to million from million for the year ended march  resulting primarily from an increase in revenues from the company s larger client base for recurring maintenance and other services together with the consolidation of micromed s revenues in fiscal cost of products and services 
cost of products and services for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  while costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenues decreased to from during the comparable periods 
the increase in the amount of costs of products and services during the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  resulted primarily from increased systems sales and an increase in customer service  support  and training personnel during fiscal plus the addition of such costs for micromed s personnel 
the decrease in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenues resulted primarily from the inclusion of micromed in fiscal to date  micromed s systems sales have not included any significant amount of hardware content 
systems sales without significant hardware content generally yield higher margins than systems sales that include a significant amount of hardware content 
the mixture of sales with and without significant hardware content fluctuates from period to period and there can be no assurance that the mixture of such sales attained in the year ended march   which contributed materially to the decrease in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenues  will be achieved in future periods 
without the inclusion of micromed  costs of products and services increased in fiscal over fiscal and as a percentage of net revenues decreased to from 
the increase in the amount and decrease in percentage before the inclusion of micromed resulted primarily from higher systems sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  representing and of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in both amount and as a percentage of net revenues was primarily the result of an increase in the company s selling efforts  including sales personnel  and administrative infrastructure together with the consolidation of micromed s selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal without the inclusion of micromed s selling  general and administrative expenses  such expenses increased over fiscal and decreased to from as a percentage of net revenues 
before the inclusion of micromed  the increase in the amount of selling  general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from an increase in clinitec s selling efforts  including sales personnel  and administrative infrastructure together with a smaller increase in such costs for qsi 
research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  primarily due to an increase in such efforts for qsi and clinitec together with the consolidation of micromed s research and development costs during fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of net revenues remained unchanged at for both periods 
without the inclusion of micromed  such costs increased and remained relatively unchanged at as a percentage of net revenues 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisitions of micromed in may and clinitec in may  the purchase price allocated to in process research and development for which technological feasibility had not been established was million and million  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  software development costs must be expensed until technological feasibility has been established 
accordingly  the purchase price allocated to in process research and development in each of fiscal and was expensed during the respective fiscal years 
investment income 
investment income for the year ended march  decreased to million from million for the year ended march  primarily as a result of a decrease in funds available for investment during fiscal after payment of the purchase price in connection with the micromed acquisition together with amounts used to fund the growth of clinitec and micromed 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
the benefit from income taxes for the year ended march  was million  resulting in an effective income tax rate of 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was  and differs from the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the non deductible charge for purchased in process research and development as well as non deductible amortization of certain intangibles acquired in the non taxable clinitec purchase transaction 
the micromed acquisition was a taxable transaction and  accordingly  the related purchased in process research and development is deductible for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  million and million for the years ended march   and primarily as a result of payments made in connection with the clinitec and micromed acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operations for the year ended march  consisted principally of net income before depreciation and amortization  increases in accounts payable and deferred service revenue  and a decrease in inventories offset by an increase in accounts receivable

year compliance 
introduction 
the company is aware of issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium approaches 
in particular  software applications that use only two digits to identify a year in the date field may fail or create errors in the year year issues 
year issues create risk for the company from unforeseen problems in computer systems that the company sells to customers on a nationwide basis which are used  among other things  to process their financial transactions and schedule patients company products  as well as systems that the company uses internally to provide certain services to its customers and to process it s own financial transactions internal use systems 
the potential costs and uncertainties associated with year issues will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s proprietary and third party developed software  hardware hardware and third party developed software will hereinafter be referred to collectively as third party products and the nature of the industry in which the company operates 
company products and third party products sold by the company may fail to operate properly or as expected due to year issues 
such failures could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of customers operations  including among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  conduct communications  schedule and treat patients or engage in similar normal business activities 
further  products and services used by the company s customers  but not supplied by the company  could fail to operate properly or as expected due to year issues 
customers efforts to plan for such events could result in the deferral  delay or cancellation by customers of current installations of and plans to purchase systems from the company 
similarly  internal use systems  including both information systems and non information systems  may not operate properly or as expected due to year issues 
year issues could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of the company s operations  including among other things  an inability to process its own and certain of its customers financial transactions  send invoices  conduct communications  or engage in similar normal business activities 
state of readiness 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to address year issues 
the company has identified individuals and or working groups to develop and implement the company s definition of year readiness  assess company products  third party products and internal use systems for possible year issues  monitor development  testing and remediation efforts with respect to company products  third party products and internal use systems  monitor and coordinate the company s deployment plans and results with respect to year releases of company products  third party products and internal use systems  and  develop contingency plans with respect to company products  third party products and internal use systems 
although the company s efforts to address year issues do not fall precisely into sequential phases  generally these efforts are comprised of an assessment phase  a development phase only with respect to company products and certain proprietary internal use systems  a deployment or remediation phase  and a contingency planning phase 
company products 
the windows product  nextgen and cps are designed to be year compliant and contain no known year issues when configured and used in accordance with the related documentation  and provided that the underlying operating system of the host machine and any other software used with or in the host machine are also year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that such products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year issues 
the company s legacy product has required significant development and remediation efforts in connection with year issues with many of these efforts commencing in in november  the company began general deployment of version of its legacy product which version has been designed to be year compliant 
the company continues to test and monitor performance of version in customer environments and expects to deliver and deploy maintenance releases in the ordinary course of business throughout the rest of calendar in addition  the company continues to progress through the development cycles with respect to certain ancillary products associated with the legacy product with deployment of these ancillary products expected to be completed by december  the company estimates that as of march   it has completed approximately of its development efforts in connection with year issues associated with the legacy product and certain associated ancillary products 
in addition at march   approximately of the company s legacy product customers have contracted to install version of which approximately have been installed as of that date 
the company expects to have substantially all of its version installations completed by november  based on the company s assessment to date  the company believes continuing efforts will be required to assist customers in deploying and testing version in many of the customers unique environments 
the company also expects an increase in service and support effort levels as the year approaches and into the early months of the year third party products sold by the company 
the company works closely with vendors of significant third party products sold by the company and has communicated with them to determine the extent to which their products and services are  or will be  year compliant 
in addition  company products have been tested  and the company plans to continue testing company products  with certain third party products 
based upon its current assessments  the company believes that it has received adequate assurances that significant third party product vendors expect to successfully address their significant identified year issues on a timely basis 
due to uncertainties associated with third party product vendors  the company is unable to predict whether a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition may result form year issues related to third party products despite the company s current assessment to the contrary 
internal use systems 
based upon the company s assessment efforts to date  the company believes that certain internal use systems will require replacement or modification due to year issues 
the company s assessment efforts are ongoing 
as of march   the company believes that its has substantially completed its assessment review of many of its major internal use systems 
certain of the internal use systems are proprietary and were developed by the company 
company personnel have used similar techniques to identify year issues with its company products and proprietary internal use systems 
the proprietary internal use systems will either be modified by company personnel or replaced with third party developed systems which the company believes will not fail as a result of year issues 
the company has communicated with developers and or vendors of certain of its third party developed internal use systems to determine the extent to which those products and services are  or will be  year compliant 
based upon its current assessments  the company believes that it has received adequate assurances that significant third party developed internal use systems are  or will be  year compliant in a timely manner to enable the company to implement any required upgrades prior to year issues being encountered in its internal use systems 
as of march   the company has replaced or completed modification of some of its internal use systems and plans to have all such systems replaced or modifications completed by december  contingency plans 
the company is currently engaged in  but has not completed  contingency planning to address company wide personnel  resource  technical and communication matters in connection with foreseeable scenarios that may develop from year issues despite the company s current and planned remediation efforts 
the company expects that its development  remediation  testing  deployment and contingency planning efforts with respect to company products  third party products and internal use systems will continue up to and beyond december  the company s contingency planning includes possible failure by the company and its vendors to complete efforts to avoid or minimize the impact of year issues on a timely basis  failure of customers to be ready for  or cooperate with  the deployment of year compliant company products on a timely basis  and  delay  deferral or cancellation by customers of current installations and prospective purchase decisions with respect to company products 
a reasonably likely worst case scenario has not yet been identified  but it is anticipated that such scenario would include the failure of significant communications and computing infrastructures by the company  its customers and its suppliers together with failures of infrastructures encompassing utilities  transportation  banking and government 
costs 
the total cost to address the company s year issues are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition 
the company does not separately track all of its internal personnel costs incurred in connection with identifying and resolving year issues 
excluding internal costs  the company expects that total expenditures to address year issues will approximate  of which approximately  has been incurred as of march  to date  all of these expenditures have been funded from operations and it is anticipated that all remaining expenditures will also be funded from operations
