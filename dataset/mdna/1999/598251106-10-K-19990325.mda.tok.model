other income consists of service charges on deposit accounts  securities gains  gains on sale of loans and fees and commissions 
other expenses include salaries and employee benefits  as well as occupancy and equipment expenses  and other noninterest expenses 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest and the company s asset liability management procedures in coping with such changes 
the provision for loan losses is dependent upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
other expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations  with additional employees necessary to staff and open new banking centers and marketing expenses necessary to promote them 
growth in the number of account relationships directly affects such expenses as data processing costs  supplies  postage and other miscellaneous expenses

commercial loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  commercial loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increases during these periods reflect increased demand due to a strong economy  and increased working capital and equipment requirements both by existing borrowers and new customer relationships

most long term  fixed rate residential loan requests are referred to midwest one mortgage services  inc for sale into the secondary market with servicing rights released 
the banks hold a small percentage of long term  fixed rate consumer real estate loans 
the increase in consumer real estate loans has been limited since due to secondary market activities with midwest one mortgage services  inc and represents a decreasing percentage of total loans 
consumer real estate loans were   and of total loans as of december   and  respectively 
consumer installment loans decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  consumer installment loans decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decreases in and were due to the runoff of other installment loans  including indirect auto loans by midwest bank of western illinois

as of december  and  the company s consumer loan portfolio included million and million  respectively  of indirect auto loans 
although the risk of nonpayment for any reason exists with respect to all loans  certain other more specific risks are associated with each type of loan 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans are quality of the borrower s management and the impact of local economic factors 
risks associated with real estate loans include concentrations of loans in a loan type such as commercial or residential and fluctuating land values 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of loan 
consumer loans additionally face the risk of a borrower s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
the company attempts to balance the types of loans in its portfolio with the objective of reducing risk 
while the company has a sizable portion of its loan portfolio secured by real estate in one form or another  a significant portion of those loans have fixed or adjustable or floating interest rates 
the company believes that most credits should have both a primary and a secondary source of repayment  and that the primary source should generally be supported by operating cash flows  while the secondary source should generally be disposition of collateral 
the company engages in very little unsecured lending  and generally requires personal guarantees of principals for business obligations 
the company practices a system of concurrence in the approval of commercial credit whereby the documented concurrence of an officer s credit committee or approval by the board or a board committee  where applicable is obtained in addition to that of the recommending officer 
this system is intended to assure that commercial credit is subjected to an independent objective review on at least two different levels

the company maintains an internal loan review function  which reviews commercial and consumer credits with the individual loan officers and assigns a risk rating grade 
in the event loan review downgrades a loan  it is included in the allowance analysis at the lower grade 
the grading system is in compliance with the regulatory classifications  and the allowance allocated to the loans is based upon regulatory grading  except in instances where there are known differences ie collateral value is minimal  ie once the specific portion of the allowance is calculated  management then calculates a percentage of each loan category based upon the past five years of loan loss history 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is determined based upon current economic conditions  trends in the portfolio  including delinquencies and impairments  as well as changes in the composition of the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   million at december  and million at december  total recoveries on loans previously charged off were  for the year ended december    for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  these recoveries were due primarily to payments from customers bankruptcy proceedings or payment plans on charged off loans  which were negotiated subsequently with customers

most of the investment securities are agency guaranteed  mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities represented  and of the total investment securities as of december   and  respectively 
based upon the company s evaluation  mortgage backed securities are a superior investment vehicle for the banks 
mortgage backed securities also offer the best combination of yield and liquidity within the company s planning periods 
mortgage backed securities offer attractive yields  provide monthly cash flows  serve as acceptable collateral and have most of the liquidity characteristics of us treasury notes and bonds 
the banks investment strategy during the past two years has been focused on seasoned and new production mortgage backed securities of moderate average lives years which have been purchased at a premium to par 
historically  management believes these securities are reasonably predictable in terms of price volatility  prepayment speeds and monthly cash flows 
the sharp decrease in long term investment yields  and as a consequence lower mortgage rates  led to a significant increase in prepayment speeds in as a result  management repositioned the investment portfolio to reduce the overall impact on yields and improve longer term profitability 
the investment portfolio is still composed primarily of mortgage backed securities  but a significant portion of mortgage backed securities held in were replaced in collateralized mortgage obligations have been a decreasing percentage of the total investment securities portfolio during the past three years 
collateralized mortgage backed securities were million or of the total investment securities portfolio as of december  collateralized mortgage obligations were million and million as of december  and  respectively  and represented and of the total investment portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
management s decision to reduce collateralized mortgage backed obligations was consistent with overall regulatory concerns regarding this type of investment for community banks 
all fixed and adjustable rate mortgage pools and collateralized mortgage obligations contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact upon prepayment rates 
the company uses computer simulation models to test the average life and yield volatility of adjustable rate mortgage pools and collateralized mortgage obligations under various interest rate assumptions to monitor volatility

a significant component in the fluctuation of net cash provided by or used in operating activities is the timing of the proceeds from real estate loans held for sale to permanent investors 
net cash used in investing activities  consisting primarily of loan and investment funding  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities  consisting principally of deposit growth and net bank borrowings  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
asset liability management the business of the company and the composition of its balance sheet consists of investment in interest earning assets primarily loans  mortgage backed securities and other securities which are primarily funded by interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
all of the financial instruments of the company as of december  were for other than trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of its interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is therefore sensitive to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize net interest income while limiting exposure to risks associated with a volatile interest rate environment 
this strategy is implemented by the company s ongoing analysis and management of its interest rate risk 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  thus creating a risk that will result in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the company s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
because the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer maturity preferences in the market areas in which the company operates 
borrowings  which include fhlb advances  short term borrowings and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which  in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the rates  terms and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in securities and loans a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms 
this permits the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
management uses a duration model for each bank s internal asset liability management 
the model uses cash flows and repricing information from each individual loan and certificate of deposit  plus repricing assumptions on products without specific repricing dates eg  savings and interest bearing demand deposits  to calculate the durations of each bank s assets and liabilities 
investment securities are stress tested  and the theoretical changes in cash flow are key elements of the company s model 
the model also projects the effect on the company s earnings and theoretical value for a change in interest rates 
the model computes the duration of each bank s rate sensitive assets and liabilities  a theoretical market value of each bank and the effects of rate changes on each bank s earnings and market value 
the banks exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and the board of directors 
each bank also maintains specific interest rate risk management policy limits 
based upon simulation modeling  these guidelines include i a change in net income upon an immediate basis point change in interest rates  and ii a change in net income upon a gradual basis point change in interest rates during a twelve month period 
effects of inflation inflation can have a significant effect on the operating results of all industries 
however  management believes that inflationary factors are not as critical to the banking industry as they are to other industries  due to the high concentration of relatively short duration monetary assets in the banking industry 
inflation does  however  have some impact on the company s growth  earnings and total assets and on its need to closely monitor its equity capital levels 
management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but it is difficult to assess the impact  since neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes in the various inflation indices coincide with changes in interest rates 
inflation does impact the economic value of longer term  interest bearing assets and liabilities  but the company attempts to limit its long term assets and liabilities  as indicated in the tables set forth under acfinancial condition and acasset liability management 
impact of new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
on derivatives will  in the year  require all derivatives to be recorded at fair value in the balance sheet  with changes in fair value run through income 
if derivatives are documented and effective as hedges  the change in the derivative fair value will be offset by an equal change in the fair value of the hedged item 
under the new standard  securities held to maturity can no longer be hedged  except for changes in the issuer s creditworthiness 
therefore  upon adoption of the statement  companies will have another one time window of opportunity to reclassify held to maturity securities to either trading or available for sale  provided certain criteria are met 
the statement may be adopted early at the start of the calendar quarter 
the company does not plan to adopt the statement early and adoption is not expected to have a material impact since the company does not have significant derivative instruments or hedging activity 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
on mortgage banking will  in  allow mortgage loans that are securitized to be classified as trading  available for sale  or in certain circumstances  held to maturity 
currently  these must be classified as trading 
since the company has not securitized loans  this statement is not expected to impact the company 
statement of position  effective in  sets the accounting requirement to capitalize costs incurred to develop or obtain software that is to be used solely to meet internal needs 
costs to capitalize are those direct costs incurred after the preliminary project stage  up to the date when all testing has been completed and the software is substantially ready for use 
all training costs  research and development costs  costs incurred to convert data  and all other general and administrative costs are to be expensed as incurred 
the capitalized costs of internal use software is amortized over its useful life and reviewed for impairment using the criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 
the company does not believe this will have a material impact 
aicpa statement of position  effective in  requires all start up  pre opening  and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
any such costs previously capitalized for financial reporting purposes must be charged to income in the first quarter of the company does not believe this will have a material impact 
the fasb continues to study several issues  including recording all financial instruments at fair value and abolishing pooling of interests accounting 
also  it is likely that apb s measurement for stock option plans will be limited to employees and not to non employees such as directors  thereby causing compensation expense to be required for awards of stock options to outside directors 
year compliance company s state of readiness the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems for ayear issues  and has developed an implementation plan to identify and resolve potential problems in compliance with federal reserve bank guidelines 
the company estimates its testing and implementation plan was complete at december  management expects to complete year testing by june  a project coordinator  who is a vice president of the company  has been assigned the responsibility of coordinating the year effort throughout the company 
the project coordinator is a director of first midwest data corp 
and therefore familiar with issues of system  vendor and customer risks relating to year compatibility 
the company s information services officer assists the project coordinator and is responsible for all network and personal computer connections and software use within the company 
in addition  the company has formed a year committee consisting of senior bank officers and other knowledgeable bank personnel 
the president of first midwest data corp 
is a member of the committee and lends significant data processing experience to the project 
the project coordinator is designated the year committee coordinator 
the company s implementation plan involves procedures and tests to reduce year risks to and by customers  equipment  vendors  and the providers of computer hardware and software services 
the company has identified mission critical vendors who have provided the company with the results of their own tests for year compliance and the company is satisfied with the results to date 
the company has performed an analysis of all inventory purchased and has made visual inspections of buildings  contents and equipment 
testing plans have been developed to measure the compatibility of all year related equipment and software 
in addition  all contracts for the purchase of new chip related or date related equipment or software are reviewed by the information services officer  and all purchases are required to bear year compatibility confirmations 
the company owns two in house computer systems 
one of these systems uses an ibm as with software provided by jack henry and associates 
the jack henry software product provides seventeen of the most critical software applications used to service the customers of the banks 
a proxy test was performed by a thirteen financial institution consortium c each organization being a jack henry software client c which was completed prior to year end the test results indicated there were no significant year related problems 
further verification of test results will continue into the first quarter of and a final report of the success of the test will be issued at that time 
in addition  the company uses personal computers at thirteen offices  connected through networks  to maintain critical systems 
each of the banking centers therefore is considered mission critical 
the computers use stand alone vendor products or service providers to provide information and customer service software 
the second in house system is a unisys computer system used to support four banking centers in western illinois 
this system has been recently upgraded and testing is now taking place on all mission critical applications 
this system software is written by iti  and no year compatibility issues have been found to date 
the company expects the tests to conclude and result in implementation by the end of the first quarter 
the company has determined that it relies on seventy eight mission critical applications or systems 
this also includes the company s reliance on vendors or products produced by others 
the company has control over thirty three of these systems and third parties provide forty five 
all thirty three of the controlled mission critical systems have been tested with successful year results 
the company is in regular contact with providers  and each is providing the company with status updates and new information as it becomes available 
the company has been examined by the federal reserve bank and the illinois office of banks and real estate through phase i and phase ii examinations 
the company s efforts were considered adequate in those examinations 
risks posed by year issues based upon responses from vendors  the company s own testing and independent appraisals conducted on behalf of the company and selected equipment and software suppliers  the company believes systems are  or will be  fully compliant before the end of the company maintains continuing contact with its equipment and software vendors on year issues and does not anticipate significant problems at this time 
nevertheless  the company recognizes the potential risks posed by year issues  and there can be no assurance that the company will not be significantly affected by year issues 
these risks include  without limitation  disruption to customer service caused by computer and system interruptions  failure to comply with federal and state regulations  and an inability to collect and service outstanding loans due to any customers failure to address year issues 
the company remains alert to any potential year problems created by customers and has been obtaining information and data from customers to assess potential exposures 
to date  responses from customers have not indicated significant year issues to be resolved 
potential losses created by cash flow problems of existing borrowers due to year issues cannot be quantified at this time with any meaningful degree of accuracy 
as a result  the banks have not provided any additional amounts to assess the allowance for loan losses to cover year related repayment risks at this time 
events over which the company has no control  such as sources of electrical and gas power  or loss of telephone communications  may result in a disruption of service to customers 
these potential events have been reviewed  and short term contingency plans have been developed to address situations in which there is a widespread loss of these vital utility services 
in such circumstances  the bank s plans provide for limited business services until such vital utility services resume and are fully restored 
the impact of year problems could be significant  although the risks have not yet been fully quantified by the banks at this time 
the inability to process  reconcile and report customer account information could create concern for the safety and security of customer deposits 
however  customer funds eligible for fdic insurance will continue to be insured against loss regardless of any year disruption 
contingency plans and costs the company has created and distributed contingency plans for situations where customer service may be inhibited by sources beyond its control 
these contingency plans provide alternatives for processing customer transactions  liquidity  and business continuation in case of a major disruption caused by year issues 
the plans provide all company subsidiaries with information that will be necessary to maintain service of customers during such circumstances 
updates and responses to additional situations will be covered in these plans as appropriate and consistent with regulatory guidelines 
the current contingency plans provide instructions for the operation of bank offices with manual record keeping and transaction processing in the event of power loss or interruption of telecommunications 
liquidity planning and funds management is also included in the contingency plans 
each bank has approved a disaster recovery plan in the event of significant events which may inhibit normal banking operations 
the company has incurred internal and external expenditures of approximately  in addressing year issues through december  this cost does not include internal salary and employee benefit costs for individuals that have responsibilities or are involved with the year project 
the company is considering additional expenditures  including the purchase of generators  which  if made  would increase year expenditures to approximately  management does not believe these expenditures are or will be material in nature or will have a material impact on the company s operations 
the estimated costs are based upon management s best estimates and include assumptions of future events  availability of specific resources  third party  vendor or customer modification plans  and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that current estimates will be realized  and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s overall interest rate sensitivity is demonstrated by net interest income analysis and gap analysis 
net interest income analysis measures the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of change in net interest income in the event of sudden and sustained to increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the tables below present the company s projected changes in net interest income for the various rate shock levels at december  and  respectively 
net interest income amount change change dollars in thousands bp  bp  base  bp  bp  net interest income amount change change dollars in thousands bp  bp  base  bp   bp   as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net interest income by or approximately  the effect of an immediate basis point decrease in rates would increase the company s net interest income by 
or approximately  the interest rate sensitivity has shifted from an exposure in a declining rate environment at the end of to a modest exposure in substantially higher rate market c basis points on an immediate basis c at the end of overall net interest income sensitivity has decreased from to gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as of december   and provides the repricing dates of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as the company s interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets funds sold   interest bearing due from banks   securities      loans      total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits   money markets   savings deposits   time deposits      total interest bearing deposits      short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase  funds purchased  and treasury tax deposits   note payable  mortgage payable   fhlb advances     total borrowings      total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap      cumulative gap     interest sensitivity gap to total assets cumulative sensitivity gap to total assets mortgage backed securities  including adjustable rate mortgage pools and collateralized mortgage obligations  are included in the above table based on their estimated weighted average lives obtained from outside analytical sources 
loans are included in the above table based on contractual maturity or contractual repricing dates 
interest bearing demand and savings deposits are included in the above table based on the proposed policy statement issued by bank regulators on august  the table uses short term repricing one to three months assumptions for all interest bearing core deposits 
management believes this is a very conservative approach  which is not consistent with the company s actual historical experience 
computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates 
these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in preparing the analyses 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the gap analysis is based upon assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment 
because such assumptions can be no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the gap table included above does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income
