item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year readiness disclosure many existing computer systems use only two digits to identify a year with the assumption that the first two digits of every year are 
with the year approaching  computer systems that are not year compliant will read the year as may malfunction 
the company s program to assess the extent of issues related to year compliance and to develop and implement solutions for those issues is being directed by senior management with the company s chief technology officer having primary responsibility for the coordination  remediation  implementation contingency planning efforts 
designated personnel at the company s headquarters and at each of the company s operating locations have been assigned year compliance responsibilities 
the program is focused on internal information technology systems  computer aided design systems  non it systems equipment with embedded micro processors  facilities and the status of compliance by larger customers  service providers  suppliers and other key third parties 
the program involves the following phases assessment  remediation planning  contingency planning  remediation replacement implementation and compliance testing 
the internal it systems compliance issues are most critical and relate to the company s financial systems  computer networks and communications systems and personnel recruiting and human resource systems 
corporate level personnel have responsibility to insure that all financial  network and communication systems will be year compliant as well as determining the status of compliance by larger customers  suppliers and other key third parties 
personnel recruiting and human resource tracking systems for billable resources are being evaluated and remediated by local branch management under the coordination of the corporate chief technology officer 
year compliance related to internal financial systems is being addressed in two ways 
the company has decided to replace its primary financial system with a state of the art integrated enterprise wide system 
this decision was driven by the need for enhanced processing  control and reporting capabilities using current technologies 
based on representations and warranties of the vendor  the company believes that the new system will be year compliant and is expected to be operational by the third quarter of in addition  the existing primary system and other ancillary systems have been evaluated for year compliance and the required remediation and testing are underway 
these efforts are scheduled to be concluded by early with respect to larger customers  suppliers and other key third parties  questionnaire surveys are being distributed for use in assessing their state of compliance in order to develop contingency plans in case of non compliance 
customers and suppliers with whom there is electronic interchange of data are of primary focus to insure that both the company and those parties are year compliant with respect to such interchanges 
the company does not believe the consequences of non compliance of third party suppliers and customers would be material due to the limited exposure the company has assessed to these parties 
the responsibility for identifying and assessing compliance issues and then implementing solutions for computer aided design systems  non it systems  facilities  and the status of compliance by suppliers and other third parties  rests primarily with each operating office 
solutions for year issues related to computer aided design systems  non it systems and facilities will  of necessity  come from vendors and others providing the related services 
the company  however  plans to identify compliance issues and monitor remediation or replacement efforts 
with respect to local suppliers and third parties  the company has also distributed questionnaire surveys in order to assess their state of compliance in order to develop contingency plans in case of non compliance 
the identification and assessment process is well underway with the expectation that solutions will be in place by the second quarter of the cost of the company s year and enterprise wide solution implementation program is expected to be approximately million  approximately  of which has been incurred as of the date of the filing of this report 
this amount includes costs associated with the new financial system and the new personnel recruiting and human resource systems described above 
these systems already were scheduled for implementation and their implementation was not accelerated because of year issues 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year readiness disclosure continued the company believes that its program to address year compliance is on schedule for completion before the end of however  there can be no assurance that there will be no material impact as a result of year issues  particularly considering the dependence and interdependence that exists with third parties and that resources for remediation and replacement may not be available in the required time frame 
since the company has a greater level of control over implementing solutions to year issues relating to its internal systems  it is more likely that adverse impacts on the company could originate with third parties rather than from the company s inability to have its internal systems year compliant 
if issues related to internal systems are not resolved before the end of  the consequences to the company could be material 
the company is in the process of developing a most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
at the appropriate time  but not later than mid  the company will determine the extent to which contingency plans are required
