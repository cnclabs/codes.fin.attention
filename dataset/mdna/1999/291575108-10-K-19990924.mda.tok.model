year compliance issues the company has evaluated its risks with respect to year compliance issues and the impact on its information systems and operations 
the significant risk areas identified include third party software utilized in house by the company on its own information systems  value added networks  outside service providers and information systems utilized by the company s primary connecting rail carriers 
the company does not utilize any internally developed software that is significant to its operations 
the company has investigated the potential impact of the year with respect to each significant risk area identified  and has determined that all significant software either is year compliant  is in the process of being modified by the respective parties to accommodate the year  or is replaceable by alternative software options at a reasonable cost 
company s state of readiness as discussed in the risk of the company s year issues section below  the company has determined that its successful transition into the year is heavily dependent upon its third party vendors  value added networks  outside service providers and connecting rail carriers becoming year compliant 
since this portion of the company s year compliance plan is largely outside of the company s control  the company has been and will continue to closely monitor the year compliance status of these parties 
based upon the company s review of information publicly disseminated and direct discussions with such parties to date  all applicable third party vendors  value added networks  outside service providers and connecting rail carriers have represented that all software significant to the company s operations either is or will be year compliant by the year however  there can be no assurance that these parties will be successful in meeting their year commitments 
the remaining portion of the company s year compliance plan is summarized below 
phase i development of a year compliance plan the company engaged the services of a year compliance consultant to assist in the preparation of a year compliance plan  to identify all hardware and third party software that is significant to the operations of the company  to test hardware identified for year compliance  and to research the year compliance status of third party software identified 
the company received the completed report from its year compliance consultant in december and has completed the planning phase of its year compliance plan 
phase ii identification of hardware and third party software applications significant to the operations of the company and preliminary identification of hardware and third party software that is not year compliant in december  the company received a report from its year compliance consultant which included an inventory and year compliance status report of significant hardware and third party software utilized by the company 
the company has completed the identification phase of its year compliance plan 
phase iii upgrade replacement and testing of significant hardware and third party software the company s year compliance consultant performed year compliance testing of significant hardware and delivered a report to the company in december which included a detailed listing of all non compliant hardware 
the company has completed upgrading and testing all significant hardware for year compliance 
where applicable  the company is in the process of replacing or installing year compliant upgrades for third party software and will install similar upgrades for other third party software as they become available 
the company intends to complete the replacement or installation of such upgrades by september  and complete testing of third party software for year compliance in october and november  in addition  the company will complete year compliance testing of software utilized by value added networks  outside service providers and connecting rail carriers as such software is made year compliant by these parties 
risk of the company s year issues the company s most significant risk with respect to the year is its reliance upon third party vendors  value added networks  outside service providers and connecting rail carriers to become year compliant 
since year compliance by these parties is outside of the company s control  there can be no assurance that the systems critical to the company s operations will be compliant by the year if any of these parties do not successfully achieve year compliance  the company s operations may be adversely affected 
the status of the company s significant risk areas is as follows third party software the company s critical third party software utilized in house consists of its railcar accounting  interline settlement and general ledger systems 
the company has installed the year compliant upgrades for its railcar accounting system and for its pc based interline settlement system 
the company s general ledger accounting software vendor has indicated that its general ledger system is year compliant 
the company is currently in the process of testing these systems for year compliance 
value added networks the company s primary value added network utilized in edi communications with other rail carriers has indicated that its software is already year compliant  and the company is in the process of testing to verify that this software is year compliant 
outside service providers the company utilizes outside service providers for certain critical railroad accounting functions including car hire accounting and rail communications through railinc 
the provider of car hire accounting services has indicated that it is in the process of modifying its system to be year compliant and that the year compliant version is scheduled to be completed by october  railinc provides a variety of central system services for the north american rail industry  including railroads  rail equipment owners  other rail suppliers  rail customers and others  and has indicated that all significant systems have been upgraded and tested for year compliance 
connecting rail carriers each of the company s primary connecting rail carriers has indicated that it is in the process of modifying its systems to be year compliant  and will be completed in time for the year costs to address year issues the company does not anticipate that the cost of becoming year compliant will be material to its results of operations 
contingency plans the company s contingency plans are segregated into two groups of software  industry specific software and all other software 
with respect to industry specific software  which includes third party software utilized in house by the company  software provided by outside service providers  and software utilized by the company s primary connecting rail carriers  the company does not have a variety of alternatives available 
as a result  the company is heavily reliant upon these vendors  service providers and connecting rail carriers to meet their year compliance commitments 
the company does not currently have any contingency plans with respect to this software  and will closely monitor the progress of these vendors  service providers and connecting rail carriers 
with respect to all other software  the company believes there are sufficient alternatives available at a reasonable cost should existing software not be made year compliant 
the company has received year compliant upgrades for most software and believes that it will receive year compliance upgrades for most  if not all  remaining other software 
should upgrades not be available  the company will acquire year compliant software with sufficient lead time for implementation
