natural products  which include herbal extracts  flavors and food ingredients  increased over the prior year 
revenues from technical services increased almost over the prior year 
pharmaceutical revenues increased as a result of the company s announcement of the termination of future production of paclitaxel 
subsequent to the announcement  increased demand for current inventories on hand resulted in increased revenues generated through the sale of paclitaxel in the current year 
such sales are not expected to continue past fiscal the company was not profitable in fiscal  nor in fiscal or with the completion of the merger  management has completed operating plans for fiscal  and believes that the company can regain profitability in the new fiscal year  based upon achieving certain sales goals and the continuation of cost controls  however  there can be no assurance of when profitability will again be realized 
discontinued activities prior to the merger  in the third quarter fiscal  the company discontinued its pharmaceutical activities 
in the quarter ended january   the company incurred a one time charge to earnings of million 
the change and the results of pharmaceutical activities have been included in the continuing operations because pharmaceutical activities did not constitute a separate business segment of the company 
in february  the company signed a contract for the sale of its pharmaceutical inventory as part of the planned closure of the pharmaceutical business 
the purchase agreement will gross approximately million to the company over the first six to nine months of fiscal and is contingent upon the company delivering the product in final form within agreed upon specifications 
the company has negotiated settlement of its yew tree cultivation agreements and termination of a multi year non exclusive agreement to supply pharmaceutical to a customer 
these agreements are contingent upon contractual performance by third parties assuming hauser s obligations under these settlement agreements

the maximum additional earnout is  the company has not earned any amounts available under either the basic or additional earnout arrangements 
the operations and disposal of ironwood have been reflected in discontinued operations because the secondary forest products activities represented a separate business segment of the company 
results of continuing activities revenues 
a breakout of the company s revenues by product and service groupings for its continuing activities is as follows year ended april  natural products includes herbal extracts  natural flavor extracts and food ingredients    technical services includes hauser and shuster laboratories    total revenues from continuing activities    increases in fiscal and were the result of increases in both the natural products and technical services categories 
revenues from continuing activities in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal revenues from continuing activities increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal natural products natural product revenues increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal the insignificant growth in this category can be attributed primarily to moderate industry growth  offset by customer efforts to manage inventory levels more tightly 
natural product revenues increased approximately in fiscal to  from  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to success in selling herbal extracts as sales of these products increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  an increase of 
technical services technical services revenues of  in fiscal increased by approximately from  in fiscal  and increased approximately in fiscal from  in fiscal these increases were due primarily to the company s concentrated efforts to increase the number of projects related to custom synthesis and natural product isolation in the pharmaceuticals industry 
gross profit loss 
gross margin for the natural products industry segment in fiscal was of total revenues compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decline in fiscal is due primarily to increased competitive pressures and changes in product mix 
additionally  overhead costs increased in an effort to expand plant capacity  in order to meet planned sales levels on certain products 
the gross margin loss in reflects that the company had only recently entered the herbal extract manufacturing business  and accordingly  manufacturing processes were still being defined 
the margin improved significantly in fiscal as the company gained more experience in these products 
gross margin for technical services decreased in fiscal to as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in is due to increased overhead costs which were not supported by revenue generating projects 
the increase in fiscal was the result of more projects related to drug development and natural product formulations that generated higher margins 
operating expenses 
research and development expenses were  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal while research and development expenses declined from fiscal  the company intends to actively continue research and development efforts  and such expenses could increase over the next year to support the growing needs of the company 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
the increase represents the company s accelerated efforts to market new products  particularly in the areas of herbal extracts and natural food ingredients 
general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal increased by from  in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal from  in fiscal during fiscal  overhead costs increased in nearly all administrative functions  due primarily to added personnel costs 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to decreased insurance  legal and consulting fees 
additionally  during fiscal  the company incurred a charge of  in connection with the disposition of certain fixed assets 
product warranty expense in fiscal of  was an estimate of anticipated costs related to a fungicide found in a product sold by the company 
the reserve related to potential product returns  re work costs  development work required to provide methodology to remove the substance from the bulk extracts and legal and professional fees 
during fiscal  the issues were addressed without the necessity for additional expense accruals  or reversal of accruals provided in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded operating expenses of  in connection with a write off of paclitaxel related assets 
this write off is part of the million charge recorded in connection with the company s decision to terminate production of paclitaxel  discussed earlier 
interest income expense 
interest income expense was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the decreases in interest income and increases in interest expense are due to less capital available for investment and increased borrowing in fiscal other investments 
the company sold its investment in a public company and realized a gain of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources general 
total cash and cash equivalents were  at april   compared to  at april  the increase is primarily due to increased borrowing on the company s line of credit of  offset by additions of property and equipment of  cash used in operating activities of  had an insignificant impact on cash flow 
as of april   the company had a revolving line of credit totaling  which expires on june  as of april    had been borrowed against the line 
as of april   the company was not in compliance with a financial covenant to report profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company has obtained a waiver from the bank for this covenant as of april  this line of credit along with a lease credit line with a bank  were repaid as part of the merger and related financing in june in connection with the termination of these lines of credit  restricted cash of  as of april   will be available for general corporate purposes 
subsequent to the merger  the company has obtained financing from wells fargo bank  na to provide an aggregate amount of  to be guaranteed by each of its subsidiaries a revolving line of credit up to  for general working capital maturing two years after the loan closing  and a  non revolving term commitment for financing the acquisition of fixed assets with a draw down period of two years and a maturity date five years following the loan closing collectively  the credit facility 
the company has also assumed approximately million of the contributed subsidiaries bank debt 
the credit facility includes a  sublimit for the issuance of commercial letters of credit up to days in term 
the advance rates for the revolving facility are of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory 
inventory collateral for loan purposes may not exceed for the revolving loan  the interest rate is the bank s prime rate minus 
or the bank s quoted libor plus per annum 
for the term loan fixed asset facility  the interest rate is the bank s prime rate minus 
or the bank s quoted libor plus per annum  or on an unspecified fixed rate basis 
a commitment fee will be charged of 
per annum on the unused portion of the term loan fixed asset commitment 
the credit facility is secured by all of the company s assets 
additionally  the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants  including certain financial covenants 
management believes that current cash reserves  the new credit facility and funds generated from earnings are sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs within the next twelve months and on a long term basis 
working capital 
working capital as of april  was  as compared to  as of april  the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in debt of  required to finance deposits and purchases of property and equipment 
property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment in fiscal totaled  this was primarily the result of improvements to manufacturing equipment for the production of herbal extracts and food ingredient products 
the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately  in fiscal for additional manufacturing equipment improvements  and expects to fund these expenditures through the million fixed asset line  described above 
income taxes 
the company has a net deferred tax asset of  that has been reduced by a valuation allowance of  as of april  included in deferred tax assets at april   are federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  income tax credits of approximately  and alternative minimum tax credits of approximately million 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income or realization of future taxable temporary difference prior to expiration of the carry forwards 
although  realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not the recorded net deferred tax asset will be realized 
during fiscal  the company increased its valuation allowance by  due to uncertainty regarding the realizability of the tax assets generated during fiscal in assessing the amount of its net deferred tax assets considered realizable  management has considered the following factors taxable income projected within the next twenty four months  the expiration dates of its net operating loss and tax credit carryovers  and tax planning strategies which would allow hauser to generate significant taxable income from existing assets including possible sale leaseback scenarios for its land  property and equipment held fee simple 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income do not materialize 
backlog 
backlog of unfilled sales orders was  of as april   compared to  as of april  backlog consists of unfilled sales orders for herbal extracts and flavors products 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the area of changes in united states interest rates 
these exposures are directly related to the company s fixed and variable rate borrowings used to fund its operations 
historically and as of april   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit is variable based on the prime rate and  is therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at april   approximately million was outstanding with an interest rate of prime plus 
the line of credit is cancelable upon days notice by the lender and  should such a cancellation occur  or the company s liquidity needs exceed amounts available under this line of credit  the interest rate applicable to replacement credit facilities might be significantly higher 
for example  if the interest rate on the company s line of credit had been twice the rates in effect for its year ended april   the company would have incurred additional interest expense of approximately  for the year  with an associated 
increase in the share loss for that year 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates will be significant until such time as its operation results permit it greater access to other lenders and lending instruments on terms equivalent or superior to those available under its current lending agreement 
year compliance hauser is preparing its systems and applications for the year yk 
the issue the company s yk program addresses is the use of two digit instead of four digit year fields in computer systems 
if the computer systems cannot distinguish between the year and the year  system failures or other computer errors could result 
the potential for failures and errors spans all aspects of the company s business  including computer systems  voice and data networks  and building infrastructures 
the company is also faced with addressing its interdependencies with suppliers and major customers  which all face the same problem 
the company recognizes the importance of readiness for yk and has given it high priority 
the company created a corporate wide yk team to represent all company business and staff units 
the team was headed by the company s director of information technology 
the team s objective was to ensure an uninterrupted transition to the year by assessing  testing and modifying information technology it and non it systems so that a they would perform as intended  regardless of the date before  during and after december   and b dates could be processed before  during and after december  and including february  with expected results year compliant 
the scope of the yk compliance effort includes i information technology it such as software and hardware  ii non it systems or embedded technology such as micro controllers contained in various manufacturing and laboratory equipment  environmental and safety systems  facilities and utilities  and iii the readiness of key third parties  including suppliers and customers 
the yk project team has taken an inventory of it and non it systems that might malfunction or fail as a result of using only the last two digits to indicate the year 
the project team categorized the potential date component failures into three categories vital stops the business operation and no short term solution is available  critical inconvenient to the business operation and a short term solution is available  and marginal inconsequential to the business operation 
it systems the company is using both internal and external resources to remediate and test millions of lines of application software code 
as of april   approximately percent of the core it systems eg  general ledger  payroll  procurement  and order management that were deemed vital or critical are year compliant 
non it systems the company has manufacturing and laboratory locations with varying degrees of non it systems such as programmable logic controllers  gauging guidance and adjustment systems  and testing equipment 
assessment and testing of non it systems for yk compliance has proven much more difficult than assessing compliance of it systems because testing of non it systems often requires shutdown of operations 
as a result  the company has approached assessment and testing of non it systems that are common to many of the company s facilities by i contacting the suppliers of these non it systems and obtaining statements that the systems are yk compliant  and ii testing components of non it systems when they are shut down for normal maintenance 
the company has also tested manufacturing lines and tested non it systems at the company s several facilities 
these tests demonstrate that time interval instead of dates are used primarily in these non it systems and support the company s belief that potential disruption of such systems due to the yk issue should be minimal 
third parties in addition to internal yk it and non it remediation activities  the company is in contact with key suppliers and with customers to minimize potential disruptions in the relationships between the company and these important third parties related to the yk issue 
the company has also categorized supplies purchased from vendors into three categories vital disruption of supply stops the business operation and no short term solution is available  critical disruption of supply is inconvenient to the business operation and a short term solution is available  and marginal disruption of supply is inconsequential to the business operation 
the company has focused its efforts on those vendors that supply goods or services deemed vital to the company s business 
all vendors categorized as vital or critical have responded confirming that they are fully yk compliant  or will have completed compliance preparations prior to september  while the company cannot guarantee compliance by third parties  the company is developing contingency plans with its key suppliers that include availability of appropriate inventories of supplies in the event the supplier is not yk compliant 
contingency planning the company is preparing contingency plans specifying what the company will do if failures occur in it and non it systems  or if important third parties are not yk compliant 
the company expects to finalize contingency plans company wide by august  for its it and non it systems  and by that same date for its key suppliers 
costs from the project inception through april   the company has spent  out of a total estimate of approximately  related to yk readiness 
these costs include the costs incurred for external consultants and professional advisors and the costs for software and hardware 
the company s process for tracking internal costs does not capture all of the costs incurred for each of the employees working on the yk project 
such internal costs are principally the related payroll costs for its information technology group and other employees who worked on the yk project 
the company is expensing as incurred all costs related to the assessment and remediation of the yk issue 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
risk assessment the company s current estimates of the time and costs necessary to remediate and test its computer systems are based on the facts and circumstances existing at this time 
the estimates were made using assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  such as skilled it personnel and electrical power  yk modification plans  implementation success by key third parties  and other factors 
new developments could affect the company s estimates of the amount of time and costs needed to modify and test its it and non it systems for yk compliance 
these developments include  but are not limited to i the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  ii the ability to locate and correct all relevant codes in both it and non it systems  iii unanticipated failures in it and non it systems  and iv the planning and yk compliance success that key customers and suppliers attain 
the company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on the current estimate of probable total cost of making its it and non it systems yk compliant 
accordingly  the company is not able to estimate possible future costs beyond the current estimates 
as new developments occur  these cost estimates may be revised to reflect the impact of these developments on the costs to the company of making its it and non it systems yk compliant 
such cost revisions could have a material adverse impact on the company s net income in the quarterly period in which they are recorded 
although the company considers it unlikely  such revisions could also have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or annual results of operations of the company 
the failure to correct a material yk problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  normal business activities or operations 
there is inherent uncertainty regarding the yk problem  in part resulting from the uncertainty of the yk readiness of third party suppliers and customers 
therefore  the company is unable to predict with certainty whether the consequences of yk failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the yk project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the yk problem  in particular  with respect to the yk compliance and readiness of its third party suppliers 
the company believes that the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be significantly reduced by the implementation of upgraded business systems and the completion of the yk project as scheduled
