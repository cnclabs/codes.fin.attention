playboy tv revenues of million from the company s domestic pay television service  playboy tv  were million  or  higher for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the calendar year ended december  cable revenues increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended december   primarily due to higher retail rates  partially offset by fewer monthly subscribers and some system drops  due in part to the implementation of section of the telecommunications act 
at december   playboy tv was available to approximately million cable addressable households  a increase compared to december  in february  the company filed suit challenging section  which  among other things  regulates the cable transmission of adult programming  such as the company s domestic pay television programs 
enforcement of section commenced may  the company s full case on the merits was heard by the delaware district court in march in december  the delaware district court unanimously declared section unconstitutional 
even though the defendants have appealed this judgment  the ruling gives cable systems the right to resume hour broadcast of adult services so long as cable systems comply with  and consumers are made aware of  the blocking on request requirement of section management believes that the effect of section on the company s financial performance may continue until the case is finally decided 
see part i 
item legal proceedings 
additionally  management believes that the growth in cable access for the company s domestic pay television businesses has slowed in recent years due to the effects of cable reregulation by the fcc  including the going forward rules which provide cable operators with incentives to add basic services 
as cable operators have utilized available channel space to comply with must carry provisions  mandated retransmission consent agreements and leased access provisions  competition for channel space has increased 
further  the delay of new technology  primarily digital set top converters which would dramatically increase channel capacity  has contributed to the slowdown 
the major reason for this delay has been the unexpected engineering problems and expenses associated with developing an affordable digital set top converter 
management believes that growth will continue to be slow in the next two to three years as the cable television industry responds to the fcc s rules and subsequent modifications  and develops new technology 
cable operators have begun to introduce digital technology in order to upgrade their cable systems and to counteract competition from dth operators 
digital cable television has several advantages over analog cable television  including more channels  better audio and video quality and advanced set top boxes that are addressable  provide a secure fully scrambled signal and have integrated program guides and advanced ordering technology 
as digital technology  which is unaffected by the relevant sections of the telecommunications act  becomes more available  however  the company believes that ultimately its pay television networks will be available to the majority of cable households on a hour basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses derivatives for managing risk  not for trading purposes 
the company s primary financial market risks relate to foreign currency exchange rates 
the company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk that future licensing royalties owed to the company  primarily from its japanese and german licensees  may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on the company s sensitivity analysis at december   fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the near term would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis measured the impact on earnings of a devaluation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies to which it had exposure 
management believes that its hedging activities have been effective in reducing its limited risks related to currency exchange rate fluctuations
