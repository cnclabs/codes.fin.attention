the company intends to use the cash provided by operating activities to make additional capital expenditures to manufacture camera systems and purchase other rental equipment 
additional cash flow provided by operating activities will be used to repay debt outstanding under the new credit agreement 
although there can be no assurance  the company believes that its existing working capital together with borrowings under the new credit agreement and anticipated cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its expected operating and capital spending requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company will not be required to pay interest on the new notes until august   which management believes will assist the company in implementing its growth strategy 
panavision currently anticipates that in order to pay the principal amount at maturity of the new notes or upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the new notes  to redeem the new notes or to repurchase the new notes upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the new notes  panavision will be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as seeking capital contributions or loans from its affiliates  refinancing its indebtedness or selling its equity securities 
none of the affiliates of the company will be required to make any capital contributions or other payments to the company with respect to the company s obligations on the new notes  and the obligations of the company with respect to the new notes will not be guaranteed by any affiliate of the company or any other person 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing actions could be effected on satisfactory terms  that they would be sufficient to enable the company to make any payments in respect of the new notes when required or that any of such actions would be permitted by the terms of the indenture or the debt instruments of panavision then in effect 
panavision is a holding company whose only material asset is the capital stock of and partnership interests in its subsidiaries 
panavision s principal business operations are conducted by its subsidiaries  and panavision has no operations of its own 
accordingly  panavision s only source of cash to pay its obligations is expected to be distributions with respect to its ownership interests in its subsidiaries 
there can be no assurance that panavision s subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends or distribute funds to panavision or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions  including negative covenants contained in the debt instruments of such subsidiaries  will permit such dividends or distributions 
seasonality the company s revenue and net income are subject to seasonal fluctuations experienced primarily in the first and second calendar quarters 
feature film and commercial production activity typically reaches its peak in the third and fourth quarters 
in north america  episodic television programs cease filming in the second quarter for several months  and typically resume production in august 
impact of inflation the company s results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to measure accurately the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  the company believes that the effects of inflation  if any  on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor 
market risk panavision is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which could impact its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
as of december  and  panavision s primary net foreign currency market exposures include the british pound  french franc  canadian dollar  australian dollar and the new zealand dollar 
at the present time  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuation 
management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in foreign currency exposure in the near future 
however  with the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union scheduled to take place in the company s fiscal year  the company has been unable to determine what impact  if any  the euro will have on foreign exchange exposure 
the company continues to monitor the effects of weakened financial conditions in the asia pacific and other regions and the impact that such conditions may have on revenue  operating expenses  the valuation of intercompany balances and on the worldwide economy 
although the company has not experienced significant losses to date  such losses  if incurred  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results  and financial position 
as of december  and  a appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would increase the related net unrealized gain by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would decrease the related net unrealized gain by million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates applicable to and would have resulted in an increase to interest expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
conversely  a hypothetical decrease in the interest rates applicable to and would have decreased interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   the company believes that the carrying value of its amounts payable under the new credit agreement approximate fair value based upon current yields for debt issues of similar quality and terms 
the fair value of panavision s fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
based upon a hypothetical increase in the interest rate  the market value of the company s fixed rate debt would be impacted by a decrease of approximately million at december  conversely  a decrease in the interest rate would result in an increase in market value of approximately million 
management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed in the future 
panavision manages its fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  the company  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements  in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and or variable interest rates based upon agreed upon notional amounts 
panavision had no interest rate swap agreements in effect at december  management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed 
under the old credit agreement  the company had an interest rate protection agreement to protect the company from libor increases 
the agreement covered a notional amount of million  which expired on june  and protected the company from libor increases above 
since the floor for this agreement was  in the event of a libor reduction below this floor  there would have been no benefit to the company 
at december   the interest rate under the old credit agreement was 
this interest rate protection agreement was terminated when the related obligation was repaid on june   as part of the panavision recapitalization 
year compliance the year problem is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
accordingly  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in complete system failure or improper operation of systems  such as miscalculations 
potential problems of this nature could cause disruptions to operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar activities 
to address the year issues  the company is using a multi phased concurrent approach 
the phases include awareness  assessment  remediation  validation and implementation 
the company has completed its awareness and assessment phases of the year project at all owned and operated locations 
these phases centered on the collection of information worldwide relative to system hardware  software and programming issues which would need modification or replacement to ensure year compliance 
the assessment phase of the project with respect to the company s major customers and vendors is viewed as an ongoing process 
the company has received a majority of the responses to its original information requests circulated in however  the company continues to request and review updated information from certain key vendors and customers regarding the continuing progress of their year projects 
at this time  the company does not believe that the costs associated with the year issues applicable to our vendors and customers will be material 
the remediation and validation phases of the project are complete as they relate to the main computer system and programs in operation at the company s headquarters in woodland hills  california 
the main accounting software and proprietary rental tracking software have been corrected to allow for the year issues 
at most other entities  the remediation phase is substantially complete and we are well into the validation phase 
both of these phases are expected to be complete prior to june  the company also anticipates completing the validation phase relative to its major vendors and customers prior to june  at that time  if there are key vendors who are not year compliant  the company s contingency plan is to locate replacement vendors whose operations are year compliant 
the company estimates that it will have completed the implementation phase relative to its internal systems and computer programs prior to june  the company currently believes that it will be able to modify  replace or mitigate its affected systems in time to avoid any material detrimental impact on its operations 
the company has incurred immaterial costs to date relative to year issues 
at this time  the company does not believe that the upgrade costs necessary for equipment and software will be material 
the company estimates that future costs associated with year issues may be approximately while the company is not presently aware of any significant exposure relative to its systems not being properly remediated in a timely manner  there can be no assurance that all year remediation processes will be completed and properly tested before the year  or that contingency plans will sufficiently mitigate the risk of a year readiness problem 
if the company determines that it may be unable to remediate and properly test affected systems in a timely manner  the company intends to develop appropriate contingency plans for any critical systems at the time such determination is made 
an interruption of the company s ability to conduct its business  due to a year readiness problem  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
however  the amount of potential liability and lost revenue  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time nor can the company identify specifically the most likely worst case scenario
