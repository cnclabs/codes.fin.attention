item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this section  readers are given a more detailed assessment of the company s operating results and changes in financial position over the periods discussed 
this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
please note that references in this section to this year and last year refer to its fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
overview mobius is a leading provider of software products designed to provide network and web based access  presentation and distribution of large volumes of diverse enterprise information 
major financial services  healthcare  manufacturing  retail and telecommunications companies and governmental entities use the company s products to facilitate customer service and other mission critical functions 
founded in  the company provided information storage  retrieval and presentation products and support  as well as consulting services throughout its first decade 
in  the company decided to focus primarily on developing and marketing software products and  as a result  sold its consulting services business 
in april  the company s registration statement was declared effective for its initial public offering ipo of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
further detail about the ipo is provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below and in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s total revenues have increased over each of the past three fiscal years  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal the company derives its revenues primarily from server and client product license fees and related annual maintenance fees 
this year of total revenues were generated by software license fees and were generated by maintenance and other fees 
license revenues of viewdirect and documentdirect products have historically accounted for a majority of the company s license revenues and for a significant portion of total revenues 
this year license revenues for these products accounted for approximately of license revenues and approximately of total revenues 
last year license revenues for these products accounted for approximately of license revenues and approximately of total revenues 
the company anticipates in the foreseeable future that license revenue from these products will continue to account for a significant portion of license and total revenues 
mobius s growing customer base has led to continued growth in maintenance revenues  from million in fiscal to million last year to million this year 
maintenance consists primarily of revenue from customer support by the company for its products 
other revenue results when mobius occasionally hires independent professional service organizations to provide customers with post sale assistance 
international revenues increased this year to million from million last year and million in fiscal as a group  the company s international subsidiaries have not achieved budgeted sales and have been unprofitable to date  and mobius expects achieving profitability will require significant management attention and financial resources 
the company intends to expand its international sales activities as part of its business strategy 
the majority of mobius s current international revenues are derived from the operations of its wholly owned subsidiaries and through agents 
the company receives a royalty that is a percent of agent or subsidiary sales of software licenses and maintenance contracts to international customers 
the company s subsidiaries conduct business in the currency of the country in which they operate  exposing mobius to currency fluctuations and currency transaction losses or gains  which are outside of mobius s control 
to date  most of these subsidiaries have operated at a loss  which cannot be consolidated for united states income tax purposes 
consequently  the company has a substantially higher effective tax rate than the us federal statutory rate as no tax benefit has been provided for the majority of these foreign losses 
to the extent that the company is successful at bringing its foreign subsidiaries to profitability  the company s effective tax rate will be below the us federal tax statutory rate as a result of realizing the benefit of the tax loss carryforwards currently being generated outside of the united states 
in addition  to the extent that mobius uses different tax structures for new foreign subsidiaries  which would permit consolidation of losses for us tax purposes  the effective tax rate will approach the us federal statutory rate 
capitalization of internally developed software costs is required once technological feasibility is established 
the period between achieving technological feasibility  which we have defined as the establishment of a working model  and the general availability of such software has been short and  therefore  software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
accordingly  the company has not capitalized any software development costs and currently does not anticipate having significant development costs that are eligible for capitalization in the foreseeable future 
software development costs are included in research and development and are expensed as incurred 
for more information on the company s capitalization of software development costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from the company s consolidated statement of income as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years indicated years ended june  revenues software license revenues maintenance and other revenues total revenues costs of revenues software license revenues maintenance and other revenues total costs of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative stock compensation expense total operating expenses income from operations license and other interest income interest expense foreign currency transaction gains losses income before income taxes provision for income taxes accretion on preferred stock net income available to common stock year ended june  compared to year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenues 
total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal domestic revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal international revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal total revenues have increased primarily because the company sold more licenses for its products to new and existing customers 
software license revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal these increases were primarily attributable to increased sales of licenses for viewdirect and documentdirect products 
maintenance and other revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal the increases in maintenance and other revenues during these years were primarily attributable to the growth in the amount of licensed software covered by maintenance agreements and to a lesser extent  increases in the maintenance fees charged by the company 
other revenues for all periods were not significant 
costs of revenues 
the costs of software license revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of software license revenues in those years 
the costs of software license revenue as a percentage of software license revenues decreased in fiscal and primarily due to increased license revenues from products that were developed exclusively by the company and therefore do not require royalty payments 
the costs of maintenance and other revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of maintenance and other revenues in those years 
the increases in costs of maintenance and other revenues were primarily attributable to increased staffing and personnel related costs 
operating expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
sales and marketing expenses have increased primarily because the company paid more commissions and bonuses for selling more software licenses  hired additional sales personnel and increased personnel related costs 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million for fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
the increases in research and development expenses were primarily attributable to increased staffing and personnel related costs for technical staff 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
the increases were generally attributable to increased professional services fees  costs for additional personnel and  in legal and professional fees relating to an acquisition that the company does not believe will be completed 
stock compensation expense of  in fiscal and million in fiscal was due to certain stock option grants made in fiscal at below fair market value 
there is approximately    and  of expense relating to these option grants to be recognized in fiscal years   and  respectively 
for further information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
license and other interest income  interest expense  foreign currency transaction gains losses 
license and other interest income was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in earnings on higher cash balances 
during fiscal  and interest expense was insignificant 
foreign currency transaction losses were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
these losses are the result of foreign currency fluctuations in the foreign jurisdictions within which the company does business 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company had effective tax rates of approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the difference between these rates and the us federal statutory rate is primarily attributable to the company not being able to consolidate foreign subsidiary losses for us tax purposes 
the changes in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal principally reflect the impact of changes in the amount of operating losses of the company s foreign subsidiaries

quarterly revenues and operating results are expected to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including lengthy product sales cycles  changes in the level of operating expenses  demand for the company s products  introductions of new products and product enhancements by mobius or mobius s competitors  changes in customer budgets  competitive conditions in the industry and general domestic and international economic conditions 
license revenues typically peak during the fourth fiscal quarter and to a lesser extent in the second fiscal quarter 
these fluctuations are caused primarily by customer purchasing patterns and the company s sales force incentive programs which recognize and reward sales personnel on the basis of achievement of annual and other periodic performance quotas  as well as the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  mobius has funded its operations principally through cash flows from operating activities and  to a lesser extent  bank financings and capital leases 
as of june   mobius had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from the million held at june  this decrease is primarily the result of the company investing million in marketable securities and long term investments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
software license installments  which  in total  increased from million at the end of fiscal to million at end of fiscal  represent payments due from customers for license fees that are paid over the term of the installment agreement 
these payments are typically made over to year terms 
since payments are made over multiple reporting periods  software license installments can fluctuate with the amount of license revenue sold on an installment basis 
the company s cash position has also benefited from the stability in deferred maintenance revenue  which was million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal deferred maintenance revenue represents the unrecognized portion of maintenance billings and the unrecognized portion of maintenance revenue unbundled from customer license agreements which are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in each of the years ended june   and  cash of million  million and million was used for the purchase of computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
in fiscal  mobius also purchased marketable securities totaling million 
cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal and was the result of raising million from a private placement of series a convertible preferred stock  repurchasing million of common stock and payment of  of capital lease obligations 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million primarily due to the company s ipo of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
as a result of the ipo  its outstanding series a convertible stock and class a non voting common stock were converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
this year  cash provided by financing activities of  was primarily due to cash received from the exercise of stock options 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and cash flows expected from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements for at least months 
the company s line of credit expired on october  and the company continues negotiations to reinstate a line of credit for working capital purposes 
in compliance with the lease of the company s corporate headquarters in rye  ny  the landlord holds a letter of credit with silicon valley bank for  this letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit 
in january  the company sold the infopac tapesaver product to technologic software concepts  incorporated of irvine  california for approximately million 
under the terms of the sale  technologic will assume responsibility for maintenance support for all existing tapesaver licenses 
as a result of this arrangement  the company will recognize million of license revenue as technologic makes payments over the next five years  and approximately million of maintenance revenue through december  for the year ended june   the company recognized  of license revenue and  of maintenance revenue related to this arrangement 
future license revenue will be variable through december  as technologic sells the tapesaver product to customers and will be  each quarter thereafter for the remaining four year term of the contract 
year compliance many currently installed operating systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields need additional digits to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
since the company s products are designed for long term storage and retrieval of data with end of life dates well beyond  mobius believes that its products are and have been year compliant 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will not experience year compliance difficulties  or that third party products  including operating systems  that are not year compliant will not have a detrimental effect on the operation of the company s products 
the company believes that year issues may significantly affect the purchasing patterns of its customers and potential customers 
many companies have expended significant resources to correct or modify their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those the company offers 
management has implemented a company wide program to prepare its internal computer systems and applications such as its accounting and word processing programs for year compliance 
the company expects to incur internal staff costs as well as other expenses necessary during the course of such efforts and the company expects to both replace some systems and upgrade others 
maintenance or modification costs will be expensed as incurred 
the total cost is not expected to be material 
in addition the company has obtained assurance from its primary service and product providers regarding their remediation efforts for the year problem 
in light of the above  the company does not anticipate any serious year problems 
however  in compliance with the sec release no 
 the company is required to estimate the impact of a broad systemic failure that is caused by the yk problem 
while the company does not expect this to occur  if the company s primary service and product providers have not completed their remediation efforts for the year problem  it could impact the company s ability to develop and maintain its products  apply cash collections and make electronic disbursements  since these activities are dependent upon the continued operation of the national power and telephony grids and the banking system 
other aspects of mobius s operations could be maintained manually  at substantially reduced efficiency  until these systems were restored to operation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at their fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
in july  sfas no 
was issued to defer the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
on december   the aicpa issued sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop  which is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after march   requires the application of the residual method for certain multiple element arrangements 
under this method  the arrangement fee is recognized as follows the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with the relevant sections of sop and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
all other provisions of sop remain in effect 
the company will adopt sop for software transactions beginning july  the company believes its current accounting policies substantially comply with sop and therefore does not expect the adoption of sop will have a material effect on its operations
