item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company derives its revenue from several sources royalties  franchise fees  developer fees consisting of area developer and master licensee fees  company owned restaurant sales  turnkey development  brand contribution private label licensing fees  and other franchise related activities 
between and  developer fees grew to represent a significant portion of total revenue as the company sold development rights for most of the television markets in the united states and certain international territories 
franchise fees  turnkey development and brand contribution increased following this period as the rate at which stores opened increased 
since the company has sold developer rights for virtually all of the united states  developer fees derived from these non recurring transactions have declined as a percentage of total revenue  while typically brand contributions  franchise fees and royalties based on franchise store sales and revenue from the turnkey program have increased 
royalties are based on a percentage of franchisees net sales and are recognized by the company in the same period that the franchise store sales occur 
generally  royalties are earned at the rate of of sales for stores opened after and of sales for stores opened before that time 
royalties are paid by means of weekly automatic drafts by the company on franchisee bank accounts for royalty stores 
as of december   franchised stores were paying royalties on a monthly basis at the rate of 
this number of stores will decline as older franchise agreements expire the majority of which will expire after 
a portion of the royalties received by the company are paid to its area developers as royalty service costs for providing on going services to franchisees in their territories 
see business franchising area developers 
royalties have increased since due not only to the growth in the number of stores  but also to increases in average weekly sales 
the increase in average weekly sales is due primarily to the conversion of older franchise stores to the schlotzsky s deli restaurant concept  as well as the selection of more free standing locations for newer stores  which have better visibility and generally experience higher sales than the smaller in line stores located in strip shopping centers which are characteristic of stores opened prior to franchise fees are payments received by the company from franchisees and are typically recognized into revenue as stores open 
the franchise fee for a franchisee s initial store is currently  the franchise fee for each additional store committed to and opened by a franchisee is  expenses associated with franchise fees are shown as franchise fee service costs and include the portion of the franchise fee paid to area developers 
the company generally pays area developers approximately one half of the franchise fees collected from franchisees in their development areas 
as the company reacquires a limited number of territories and buys down the percentage of participation by certain area developers  the company expects that franchise fee service costs will decrease as a percentage of franchise fees to less than 
restaurant sales are reported from company owned stores  and declined between and as a result of the company s strategy adopted in to develop only franchised stores 
the number of company owned stores declined from to two stores between and restaurant sales increased significantly in because the company s flagship restaurant in austin  texas was in operation the entire year and because two additional stores were acquired from franchisees during currently  company stores are operated primarily for product development  concept refinement and training franchisees 
management does not believe that the operating cost of sales for company owned stores is indicative of costs for franchised stores on a system wide basis 
restaurant sales should increase as the company continues to acquire or open a limited number of additional company owned stores 
see business strategy company owned stores 
the company charges developers a nonrefundable fee for the exclusive rights to develop a defined territory for a specified term 
typically  a portion of the developer fee is paid in cash and the balance is paid with a promissory note 
see business franchising area developers and international master licensees 
when the company has fulfilled substantially all of its contractual responsibilities and obligations  such as training  providing manuals  and  in the case of master licensees  reasonable efforts to obtain trademark registration  the company recognizes as revenue the cash portion of the fee and the value of the promissory note  as determined by an independent third party valuation 
these fees have declined in the last three years as most of the remaining domestic territories have been sold and fees from the licensing of international territories  which are not aggressively marketed by management  remain sporadic 
revenue is also generated from brand contribution private label licensing fees and the turnkey program 
the company has licensed manufacturers to produce schlotzsky s private label products and began receiving licensing fees from sales of private label foods to franchisees in late this revenue has increased significantly to  for   for and  for the company believes that private label licensing fees will increase as a greater portion of the systems menu ingredients are covered by the program  system wide sales grow and terms with various suppliers are renegotiated 
see business purchasing  private labeling and risk factors importance of licensing fees 
the company instituted the turnkey program to further assist franchisees in obtaining superior sites and to achieve more rapid penetration in those selected major markets where the company believes there is strong demand by franchisees for good locations 
under the turnkey program  the company works independently or with an area developer to identify superior store sites within a territory 
the company will typically perform various consulting services including  but not limited to  site selection  feasibility analysis  environmental studies  site work  permitting and construction management  receiving a fee and recognizing revenue upon the completion of these services 
the company may assign its earnest money contract on a site to a franchisee  or a third party investor  who then assumes responsibility for developing the store 
the company may also purchase or lease a selected site  design and construct a schlotzsky s deli restaurant on the site and sell  lease or sublease the completed store to a franchisee 
where the company does not sell the property to a franchisee  the company sells the improved property  or  in the case of a leased property  assigns the lease and any sublease  to an investor 
the company anticipates that the total investment in each developed free standing location will be approximately  to  less for leased locations 
from inception of the turnkey program through  the company typically provided a credit enhancement in the form of a limited guaranty on the franchisee s lease for leased locations 
upon sale of the leased site or assignment of its earnest money contract  the company has deferred revenue generated even though proceeds were received in cash and allocable costs incurred in connection with the property 
when a lease guaranty is terminated  or the company s exposure to loss under the guaranty has passed  the company recognizes the revenue and allocable costs related to the site 
generally  if no credit enhancement is provided in connection with such transactions  the company may recognize the revenue and allocable expenses in the periods in which the transactions occur 
during  the company began emphasizing ownership of the real estate by franchisees through a program which entails acquiring the rights to a superior site and reselling the property  or its rights with any improvements  to a franchisee whose mortgage loan is financed by a third party financial institution 
the company provides credit enhancement for the franchisee in the form of a limited guaranty in favor of the lender 
generally  in those cases  the company recognizes the revenue and allocable expenses in the period in which the transaction occurs 
in some cases  the company may interim finance land and building costs in anticipation of permanent financing by a financial institution 
the company believes that the turnkey program enhances the company s ability to recruit qualified franchisees by securing and developing high profile sites and achieving critical mass for advertising purposes more quickly in selected markets 
in addition  the company charges a fee when it is requested to manage construction of a store on property owned by a franchisee or an investor 
this construction management fee is recognized when the store is completed

 the company currently has a line of credit available from a financial institution to finance turnkey program capital requirements 
in december  the line of credit was increased to allow the company to draw up to  and bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate and expires december as of december   the company had drawn approximately  on this line of credit and had allowed certain area developers and franchisees to borrow  under this credit facility 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  together with the proceeds of the turnkey program  collections from notes receivable and borrowings under existing credit facilities described above will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
if net proceeds from the turnkey program  credit facilities  and cash flow from operations are insufficient to finance the company s future expansion plans  including continuing investment in turnkey program properties and the buydowns of percentages of participation by certain area developers  the company intends to seek additional funds for this purpose from future debt financings or additional offerings of equity securities  although there can be no assurance of the availability of such funds on acceptable terms in the future 
year compliance the year issue is a result of many computer programs being written using two digits  eg  to define a year 
date sensitive software may recognize the year as the year rather than the year this would result in errors and miscalculations or even system failure causing disruptions in business activities and transactions 
the company s computer software programs utilize four digits to define the applicable calendar year and therefore the company believes that it has no material internal risk concerning the year issue 
the company has received preliminary responses from many of its major restaurant equipment suppliers indicating that they and the products they sell to the company s restaurant system also have no material internal risk from the year issue 
to date  none of the company s major suppliers have indicated that they anticipate material internal risks 
the company is continuing a process of in depth inquiry concerning the readiness of its major suppliers and those of the restaurant system 
the company will assess and  where practicable  attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of these entities to be year compliant 
the company plans to continue to educate its franchise system during to prepare them to anticipate year issues which could affect them locally 
the company does not anticipate that its costs associated with monitoring readiness and mitigating risks concerning the year issue will be material 
however  even if favorable responses are received  there can be no assurance that third parties will be year compliant 
the impact on the company s operations  if any  from the inability of any of its suppliers and franchisees to become year compliant is not reasonably estimable except that if there is a national or regional crisis in the financial  transportation or utility infrastructure  it would likely adversely affect most commercial enterprises  including the company 
quarterly comparisons since the adoption of the schlotzsky s deli restaurant concept in  the company has experienced growth in royalties and franchise fees 
store openings typically mark the recognition of franchise fees and the beginning of the royalty stream to the company 
accordingly  a large number of store openings has a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue 
the timing of store openings can also affect the same store sales and other period to period comparisons 
there were store openings in  in and in at july   the initial franchise fee was increased from  to  and was further increased to  effective august  the net profitability from developer fees is substantially higher than that derived from royalties and franchise fees because of the relatively lower costs associated with developer fees 
therefore  quarters in which the company derived a high percentage of total revenue from developer fees reflect substantially higher margins 
while developer fees were a significant portion of revenue in past years  it is anticipated that they will not be material in the future because most of the attractive developer territories in the united states have been sold 
moreover  the company anticipates that royalty and other revenue will continue to increase so that developer fees will decline as a percentage of total revenue  resulting in more normalized margins 
also  the company believes restaurant sales and private label licensing fees brand contributions will continue to increase as a percentage of revenue 
in  the company recorded a significant fourth quarter adjustment related to activities within the turnkey program 
the adjustment included the deferral of approximately  representing the excess of proceeds received of approximately  over the related development costs of approximately  in connection with the transfer of title or assignment of earnest money contracts on turnkey program properties to various third party investors 
revenue is deferred only in those turnkey program transactions for which the company provides a credit enhancement to the third party investor in the form of a guaranty on the franchisee lease assigned at the same time that the sale or assignment of the property occurs 
the company also deferred certain costs of approximately  associated with the acquisition  development and  in some instances  construction of the turnkey program properties 
the applicable tax effect of the adjustments was approximately  during  only five of the turnkey program transactions involved the company s guaranty on franchisees leases with third party investors who acquired properties from the company 
accordingly  most of the revenue from turnkey program transactions during was recognized in the period in which the transactions occurred 
management believes that the company experiences only moderate seasonality 
the company attempts to make store sales less seasonal by offering a variety of products which tend to sell better during various seasons

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in short term interest rates on loans from financial institutions could materially affect the company s earnings because the underlying obligations are either variable  or fixed for such a short period of time as to effectively become variable 
at december  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based upon the increased interest expense of our variable rate debt and assumes no change in the volume or composition of debt at december  the fair values of the company s bank loans are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates
